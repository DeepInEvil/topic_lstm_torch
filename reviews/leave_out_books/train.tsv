none of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff i bought this and the 8 fry pan 2 months ago and except for the bottoms still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day i even used a bacon press \( cast iron \) in it every time i cooked bacon and a couple of times i accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left hubby stacked knives and forks inside then topped it off with 6 dinner plates i thought it was done for scratches and nicks everywhere but no not a single mark my calphalon commercial nonstick \( which hit the trash already \) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr old did that i must admit though that i do not use metal utensils in it nor do i put in a dishwasher since i won t have one til the kitchen is remodeled overall though just from what abuse it has gotten i m very impressed and will buy more my advice don t mess with the rest buy the best and this is it going to try the wok next wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it	positive

why do they call it a 3 cup press i barely get one cup out of it are they talking expresso cups well anyway every single time i use it i get grounds in my cup everytime grounds yuck this is the third french press i have owned and it is the worst of the three i guess i will continue my search for a fourth french press before i choke on too many grounds	negative
this is just what i was looking for i use it for the few dishes that don t make it in to the dishwasher but mostly for drying the baby bottles the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes	positive
i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets these blankets are of really cheap quality thin mesh like texture threads get loose at the ends leaving traces of fabric everywhere i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies	negative
my husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me i thought okay until i opened the package this shamrock green is so pretty this dinnerware is great a nice heavyweight the glazing is brillant and the cereal bowls are a good size not too small as other types tend to be i am very happy i own this and have bought more since	positive
people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can i have tried reconnecting it many times using different pressure as i push down but to no avail at 10 dollars a night this product will get very expensive very quickly if it had worked without the leak i would have given ssscat 5 stars	negative
this is a great pan aside from the fact that it is easily the best non stick on the market \( and i have used anolon calphalon and scanpan \) what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution there are no hot spots not even the center when sauteing the food colours evenly \( even when the pan is a little overcrowded \) when stewing you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food demonstrating how even the heat distribution is this pan also makes a fine risotto oh and did i mention its non stick is simply the best clean up is a breeze nothing sticks even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan swiss diamond is the king of non stick as not only is their surface no 1 but the quality of their pans is second to none i own two swiss diamond pieces i plan to buy more and i couldn t recommend these pans more highly this is the pan i reach for the most	positive
i bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy i then bought one for my daughter she used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit the blade assembly as per other reviews it is going to cost about 50 to repair now mine is smelling i am using my old 15 year old oster and it is still working also to my surprise it is doing a better job just not as pretty i have ka stand mixer hand blender food processors large and small emersion blender and attachments for all love all of them will buy other ka but not this again	negative
reasons 1 faulty battery cover design the battery cover comes off time i remove the timer from a metal surface 2 the protective glass is cloudy making the timer numbers hard to see 3 the alarms are not very audible 4 the magnet unglued itself within the first three days of use	negative
i bought this kettle in february 2006 i liked everything about it until its automatic on off switch died recently only two months after the purchase now the kettle won t turn on it wasn t abused in any way and these kettles usually last for years and years the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique has anyone else had one with a short lived switch or was i unlucky	negative
i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store it sucks wonderfully don t get me wrong the reason why it s got to be returned to targetland is because of 1 the noise 2 the dust that flies out of the dust cup when you re emptying it the noise is certainly the loudest i ve ever heard on a vacuum cleaner but i thought hey that s okay if you want to be noisy until i ventured into cleaning the stairs there s not much of an extension between the cleaning wand brush and the actual machine so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris \( what have you \) from the stairs carpet i had the crazy noise blasting turbo style directly into my ear \( this was done 15 minutes ago and my ear still hurts \) the other problem i ve found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup i am having to actually touch dirt and dust \( the entire outside of the cup is coated with it \) while pouring the dirt into the trash can a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor nasty and what s the point in the dust cup if this happens i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently \( it died after 2 1 2 years \) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup nor falling to the floor so alas my friends i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store mayhaps i ll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags \( you know the old fashioned kind \)	negative
i say nearly useless because the ceramic pot is a nice size and weight for melting chocolate in the microwave \( which is what you ll have to do \) and the warmer makes a decent trivet but it does not ever get hot enough to actually melt the chocolate we followed the directions and allwed 1 2 hour for the chocolate to melt \( putting chips in as we started dinner \) half an hour later some of the chocolate \( on the outside of the crock by the burner coil \) had melted a bit an hour passed still nothing much now given that cocoa butter melts at body temperature \( which is why it is used in cosmetics \) that s saying something the pot never reached 98 degrees if i d put the chips in a zip lock in my lap during dinner i would have had better results since this was a relatively inexpensive item and i got it effectively for free during amazon s recent valentine s day promotion i did not send it back \( thinking it would be unfair to make them pay shipping both ways on an item which costs near as much to ship as it does to buy \) but if you are actually paying for this don t bother \( or at least be advised that it will not actually melt the chocolate \) it does do a reasonable job of holding the temperature once you ve melted the chocolate some other way	negative
will work fine if you only use a few light coats not designed for a family of four in a colder region it s now proped up in the corner as it has lost two leggs and half it s hooks now shopping for a new one looked nice in the oak	negative
i bought this product in december 2004 after two months of use \( about once a week \) the on off switch broke eventually after using it for a year \( and trying to get hoover to correct the problem \) just before christmas 2005 i got quite a fright when i started smelling smoke whilst using it i discontinued the use of the product and asked hoover once again to please look at it their reply was that i should take it to one of their authorised shops where they ll repair it charge me then hoover will see if it was in fact a factory error and only then refund me when they feel they re not in the wrong please don t waste your money on this product it is defnitely not worth it it is noisy vacuums carpets well when used to work but is unable to vacuum floors at all \( one of the options on it \) sorry hoover but you have lost a loyal customer \( my whole family for 3 generations back has always bought hoover including myself	negative
i am extremely pleased with the anolon cookware set it cooks evenly and cleans up beautifully many of my friends recommended this set and i m glad to have taken their advice and made the purchase	positive
total rubbish wood was scratched on top corner was smashed water damage on the shelf and door was cracked it is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use the holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control to add salt in the wound the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and i had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it if you like taking chances and do still want to buy it it s probably a 50 50 chance that it will be damaged	negative
i ve owned this sofa for less than a year and it completely fell apart the seat of the sofa is supported by a wooden frame with a nylon webbing stretched taught and stapled over it we had 4 people of reasonable weight on the sofa \( something we ve done numerous times before \) and it collapsed out from underneath us the four parts of the seat frame are held in with small little dowels that rest on a less than one inch lip around the outside of the couch frame the sofa is designed to look nice but does not hold up well to average use for 400 a sofa should last at least a year of moderate use of people only sitting on it you re better off going to ikea or some other retailer that spends as much time in the basic structural design as they do in the appearance of the couch	negative
my mother in law and i both had this blender hers broke in a couple of months i was lucky that mine lasted a couple of years it is a great blender for crushing ice for smoothies icees etc however it has a flaw that the piece that the pitcher sits on when it spins is made out of plastic it eventually cracks from the heat friction produced i bought the oster beehive blender to replace it and it has a metal piece beneath it and i have had it for a few years now with no problem i am even happier with the oster beehive blender as it is a much better quality blender which will last a lot longer than the cuisinart one \( it was also cheaper \) and it crushes ice exactly as good if not better than the cuisinart blender	negative
this is a very nice pan for 20 the non stick surface works very well even without cooking oil the heavy aluminum heats up very evenly the glass lid helps prevent over cooking of course non stick pans are for low to medium heat only you cannot use this pan for high heat stir frying	positive
hunter fan arrived in 2 days from amazon com and immediately i noticed the weight of the fan heavy just the way i like it unpacked this beauty and plugged her in and off she went with a beautiful sound i love the 3 wing blade and the speed variation is great from barely running to blow your hat off we love it keep up the good work hunter i intend to buy one for a christmas gift also	positive

not too happy with this small pizza stone before i ordered this one for a long time i had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking i couldnt find these bricks again i had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now but they were so much better than this small round stone my bricks made my pizza crust so crispy and this stone is a poor substitute for this my bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf if anyone knows what i am writing about pls email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name i am not happy with this pizza set the rack is of no use the pizza cutter is a cheap one they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras	negative
the unit has nice large digits but the wireless sensors don t work consistantly the system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down we have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re established	negative
my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st amazingly i would have bought it after reading the reviews here i m starting to wonder who writes these things lg employees the microwave is fine no complaints the toaster however is an unmitigated disaster i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances this appliance is a poster child for this thought the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently \( sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10 \) more importantly the toaster broke after 31 days \( coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named ricky managing the store what can you expect \) lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty the problem is they can t think outside of the box they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up ok no problem one day later it breaks again it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not that s how bad it was lg will not budge have it repaired again \( great option costs lg money me more travel time and it won t do the job \) or do a rebate the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product huh so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace \( they admitted they don t have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new \) and then don t stand behind your product you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here our we so bad as a manufacturer that we can t top this their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this you can cal korea but they won t change their policy they said i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same shame on you lg you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me	negative
we are using 2 love seat throws for an old l shaped sectional sofa it really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color the material quality is great for the price the only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping say about once a day the throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in built mechanisms to hold in place \( e g a velcro system straps etc \) so you have to put the throw over the sofa again neatly if you don t mind arranging the throw about once a day this will be a very inexpensive and great looking cover for your sofa	positive
the step stool a gift for my daughter works well as a step stool the problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool the frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws there was a hole in the box and the screws fell out so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together	positive
i have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than 30 a month after we purchased this water filter i can tell there s little difference between the water i buy at the store and the water from this filter i also feel confident if my daughters drink it because i know they re not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water i recommend this filter	positive
product arrived promptly in good condition this product costs twice as much at vets office somebodies making money	positive
this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes i ve owned larger crockpots for a couple decades \( currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family size meals \) but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space aren t at all useful for heating or re heating small quantities this little crockpot however is perfect for heating or re heating 2 4 servings of soup or stew i originally bought it however because it is absolutely perfect for making hot cereal on cold mornings especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop such as steel cut oatmeal \( try the nutty goodness of traditional steel cut oatmeal once \( also available here at amazon \) you re unlikely ever to return to instant or quick cook oatmeal again \) there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you from mid october to late march virtually every night i prepare my entire family s hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave other uses we ve discovered it s perfect for making serving hot mulled cider keeping hot dips gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet as a substitute fondue pot for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient \( how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup \) for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker especially if used in conjunction with rival s inexpensive sp100 pdq smart part module \( also sold on amazon as of the date of this review \) which provides the same timed cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival s larger more expensive crockpots the energy used is minimal too only 80 watts the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher as does the lid for very convenient clean up	positive
i m a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover s delight it turned out to be my biggest nightmare it takes a lot to set it up and get it started if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place boy what a mess it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy took up way to much room on my counter i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good if not better it s small easy to run and the coffee tastes great deb in new hampshir	negative
i bought this coffee maker because of its compact size but returned it a week later i found it very difficult to avoid spillage when pouring the water into the coffee maker and the coffee into a cup the problem was worse if making more than 4 cups another problem was the taste of the coffee i like my coffee full of flavor i have been using drip coffee makers for several years and think i know how to get the coffee just right but every carafe of coffee from this tasted weak and much too hot almost scalding	negative
i just received this set yesterday and haven t had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet \( i ll try to remember to update this review once i do \) but there were a few initial impressions i thought merited a review on their own the cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package instead the kit contained a small fold out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook \( i doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook or even that it sways many would be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit but its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase and is something you should know before you buy \) that having been said the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good i have no doubt whatsoever that they ll be wonderful functional additions to my kitchen the hard anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability i m impressed and i ll be back to say more once i actually use them to make pizzas	positive

after reading countless poor reviews of the dolce desk and hutch i was quite skeptical about ordering it online i gave in and ordered the set from target com the desk arrived in almost perfect condition \( a few smudges in the stain \) however only half the hutch was in its box the entire drawer \( left side of hutch \) was missing the hardware was missing and the assembly instructions were missing i recommend calling your local target store to check the dolce collection s availability \( and the parts inside \) before you waste the time and gas to get there aside from the missing hutch the desk looks really great in my home office	negative
the metal side arms that the drawer slides down on were binding and need some lubrication somewhat flimsy i do not expect it to last long nice concept but i wish they had used better materials	negative
we bought two santas and two pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at amazon they were the best gifts we gave immediate hits with each couple one in their late 50 s one in the mid 20 s in each case the response was the same it s like my childhood they are going in the living room each season vivid but soft these are superb decorations	positive

i have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the senseo coffeemaker folding filter paper didn t work too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee the quick cup sounded like a good idea but it doesn t fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee i found that the eco pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well the key to any of these re usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter the pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee the quick cup and the eco pad are essentially the same design but the eco pad fits the holder correctly and the quick cup is slightly small buy the eco pad it works the quick cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the quick cup and the holder a gasket to prevent the water from going around good luck	negative
i have two of these one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color they re attractive of course this is fiestaware after all but they re darn functional they re long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs and they re deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you re carrying or serving i like wish there was one slightly bigger too then i d get two more	positive
saucepan made in indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely there was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit it was in the construction of the pan as a long time user of revere ware we were very disappointed in this product sent to us we will never purchase another revere ware product once burned we will not go back to a second treatment	negative
i am not a coffee connoisseur so my criteria for a good coffee maker is probably modest i bought the ka javastudio because i own several ka appliances and have always been pleased although the ka 10 cup is pricey i felt that buying a thermal carafe represented an upgrade from my previous glass carafe i also figured that the wide spray mechanism might mean a richer cup of coffee i did as much research as i could reading reviews and looking at available coffee makers in my area after trying out our new ka yesterday my husband and i were both disappointed in its functionality and performance here are some points to consider about this product 1 the ka 10 cup makes 4 1 4 oz cups in other words if you re looking for 8 ounce servings the most this will make is about 5 real cups of coffee 2 the thermal carafe is heavy if you re planning on keeping this on your counter and possibly under a cabinet it is a tug to pull it out each time you use it to pour water in the back 3 there is no way to figure out the water level in the tank the directions say to use the optional white water filter insert 4 for us at least taste wise there is no discernible difference between what the ka brewed and what we ve tolerated with our old coffee maker good luck with your search for a more perfect coffee maker	negative
bad quality on off switch and plastic ring broken after 1 year	negative
we bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name we have been using it for about 4 months now it cooks good rice however the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said we ve got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason and the rice was in keep warm mode at all times in addition if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the keep warm mode for a day the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy so you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout i haven t tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice if i were to decide all over again i would stay away from this rice cooker i thought i ve bought a top notched product now i regret that i spent this much on a rice cooker	negative

i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy i would say this table is worth 20 and no more	negative

i purchased this for a betta fish which was a gift for my cats this model was perfect because the lid screws on which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish there is a small hole at the top so you don t have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish the aqua gems cover the bottom but i added some gravel for additional covering also the aqua gems are light and you lose some when changing the water so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually the one negative i found is that the light is basically useless it illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly other than that i m very satisfied i did look at petsmart for additional oxygen stones but they don t sell them not sure if those are really necessary though	positive
these are great the keep my drinks cold for a very long time and are top rack dishwasher safe	positive

yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size \( but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact \) i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it	positive

i really bought these measuring spoons to match the michael graves measuring cups that i was planning to buy and i am sure glad that i did the are the easiest to use measuring spoons that i have ever used the unique handles seem just right you can use them equally well with either hand it seemed with the dipper type spoons that i previously used i was always changing hands and the spoon was always in th wrong hand with these you can forget that you can tell the size of each of them just by looking at them but i wish that they would have embossed the sizes all a little larger and painted them white black on black is hard to see especially when the numbers are so small	positive

we have tried a variety of knife sharpeners and they didn t work very well finally i purchased this item and we have been quite pleased ever since friends even ask to use it if you need sharp knives for cooking then this item is a great purchase the cost may seem higher than most but well worth the quality and it really sharpens both serrated and straight knives easy to use and nice addition to a kitchen where you enjoy cooking	positive
i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and 1 they are too big and take up too much space and 2 the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3 the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better	negative
i haven t used this for herbs but i have used it for onions and garlic and like the other reviewers found it very handy for quick and tear free mincing it s a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect i love that it s only 3 small parts \( 4 if you count the rubber blade \) that all fit easily into the dishwasher \( top rack \)	positive

got this tea kettle for a gift recently it s discontinued on amazon but they sell it at home goods for 24 99 pros asthetically pleasing \( looks pretty \) removable top for wide area to fill with water and makes it easier to wash removable whistle \( i can t stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle so i remove the plug \) cons it d be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up plug on the spout instead of the removable one \( i ll lose it eventually the other le creuset models have the flip up plug that opens with a press of the thumb \) the poor design of the spout is dangerous no matter how slowly i pour the boiling water \( even with the small amount i use only 4 or 6 ounces at a time \) a few tablespoons of water blub out very quickly sorry i can t think of a better descriptive word the spout opening is way too small but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water so the first few tablespoons gush out so when you pour the water do it as slowly as possible put the mug on your counter or another surface that won t get ruined when wet and don t hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the blub of boiling water will burn	negative
had trouble finding out how to put it together then the motor started and would not stop had trouble getting the bottom in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again i would return it but it is too heavy to move heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task i will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop that should not take too long	negative
i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than 5 same concept just a lot cheaper two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they re holding i m sure it s pinhole sized if you re hanging something that weighs a few ounces \( in which case you don t need this use a pushpin \) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin sized but it is a heavy shelf the hole is still way smaller than the hole i d make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks \( the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang \) this is a small detail but if you need two of these things and you don t do it right your object is gonna be crooked but on the bright side you won t have a huge hole to patch when you redo it recommended product \( but look around for the knockoffs	positive

i purchased this item after having read about banneton in the book rustic european breads from your bread machine the picture clearly shows 4 baskets and the description is vague but you only get one the basket you get is quite small all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket it looks sturdy and well made it would have been good value for four baskets it was too much to pay for a single basket i didn t actually use it choosing instead to return it so i can t comment on how well it worked	negative

i was very very disappointed with the performance of the tribest blender i bought it to blend breakfast smoothies nothing fancy just some protein powder and soy milk i even bought the larger cup the unit is very very under powered did not mix the ingredients had to transfer everything to my larger more industrial blender would not recommend this unit for any serious blending save your money or put it towards a better unit this product is a rip off does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder	negative

i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one the pampered chef one works better than this one however this is not a horrible product one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you can t see through this one to see how high the oil level is you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway and when it is less than 1 3 full you need to fill it back up or it won t work as well this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level it almost won t spray if the level is too low but since you can t see through it even holding it up to the light you have to look down in and estimate how high it is the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is you don t want to fill it all the way up either then you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped this one sprays a very fine spray finer than the pampered chef one and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there i think i know why my old one got clogged so i m trying something new each time i m done before i put it away i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure i think if you leave it pressured up all the time like i did with my old one it damages the nozzle over time but time will tell if i m right another tip don t fill it with anything but olive oil other oils evaporate and leave a sticky greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it olive oil doesn t do that that s why i now don t use anything else on my stovetop \( except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying \) this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it trust me but if you have a choice go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer it s cheaper and better quality	positive
this coffeemaker s design is flawed but my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best i ve received from any company in years they sent their new thermal carafe model which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of give them a chance to make it right customer service is part of the equation with any purchase and mr coffee sunbeam has impressed me on that score	negative
i returned the honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed the 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box the first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the high speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings the second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position the fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate the 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier the design defects are so major that the person \( s \) that designed and approved the design of the 6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired the first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink because of this i must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still cannot completely fill the water container to the top the screw on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright the next design defect is that one cannot at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container one can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night the last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just drop into place on the base one must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position angle of the water container to get it to seat properly this is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time i bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service i also selected the 6011i humidifier because of its many desirable features however the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i humidifier i believe that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier thus i returned the 6011i humidifier	negative
this grill pan heats relatively evenly and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously it leaves nice grill marks on the food and works well overall the press that comes with it is very nice to have as it helps cook food faster however it has one major drawback it makes a very odd smell when it is used regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product i have a number of higher end calphalon non stick pans and none of them make this smell making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan bottom line if i had to do it over again i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead	negative

i previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal so i bought these as replacements the previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal the rubber sections on these are so thin that they didn t even seal the wine bottle i first tried them on all three stoppers in the set had the same problem oxygen and leakage are death to a wine so a stopper that doesn t seal is worse than just replacing the cork	negative

although it doesn t mention it these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150 i had to email hamilton beach to find out but they were very helpful and responded right away when the filters arrived from amazon i saw that on the box it says fits models 04160 04161 04150 with our cat and houseful of antiques we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around i run this model in our office under the table which holds the computer since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job the regular settings can be louder than expected but i leave them on the whisper quiet setting when we re in that room and i don t even notice them being on i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners	positive
if you want the retro look and a super toaster this is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great i ve had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering it s a big toaster shape is unusual \( taller in back than the front \) which gives it a little character excellent	positive

very nice warm blanket but too big for a full size bed way too big	positive
i ve had this pot for over a year and love it fast hot great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time i bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because i loved the looks of it and there were limited choices at the brick and mortars i read all the reviews only after i bought it the reviewers major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking yes the plastic knob is poorly designed and is the only reason i give this pot 4 stars instead of 5 the designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob however it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot this is what i ve been doing since i bought the pot and i ve had absolutely no problems with the knob it s unlikely you ll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot so you can avoid burned fingertips a secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee i ve never had this problem i suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket or they are using the wrong grind it s important with any percolator to use a percolator grind or fac for all coffeemakers grind	positive
i checked out this machine at a local store it s little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine for that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately regarding this delonghi machine on the drip coffee side metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds on the espresso side you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make and then empty the strainer when you re done the optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee for only a bit more money \( 500 or so \) you can get a full automatic espresso cappuccino maker i bought a full automatic several years ago and my family loves it full automatics grind the beans for each cup they make excellent american style coffee as well \( simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee \) and you dispose of grounds once a week the only disadvantage of full automatics is that like every espresso machine they do only one or two cups at a time so if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once you ll need a plain old coffee maker like the right hand side of the delonghi	negative

took the pan home and promptly fried a steak on high thereby causing an apartment full of smoke and a pile of burnt crud on the pan including a large stain seemingly impossible to get off tried everything including the company s recommended bleach method no luck then i tried baking soda as suggested in one of the reviews here and it just simply wiped away the damage like new then i set about reading the instruction booklet and have had great results using low heat it s really a different way of cooking but the fried stuff comes out just as if i d used high heat on another pan stainless steel s great too of course but this is a worthy and earthy alternative i take the perspective that the ceramic layer gives the pan a solid foundation for the seasoning process	positive

we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago it has held up so well that i just purchased ten more place settings \( the friday only sale \) to use for entertaining our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold \( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from \) the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions	positive

i love my spice rack don t get me wrong i mounted it under my cabinet to increase storage space in my tiny kitchen unfortunately sometimes when i spin it \( gently as always \) the entire rack comes off and falls apart the spices go everywhere and creates a mess not to mention wastes spices i had it come off twice in one week it happens if we spin it clockwise or counter clockwise there is no way to lock it into place it sits in a channel but is not locked so look out when you spin or put your other hand underneath it to steady it also really fine spices like cinnamon tend to escape and dust behind i don t mind it but if you re a clean freak it ll drive you insane it gets everywhere	positive
delighted with them an franciscan apple collectors delight nice air tight lids	positive
i am so disappointed with this vacuum i will say it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet but don t expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye also i have a cat so i have pet fur on my carpet and i lose a lot of hair myself and this vacuum doesn t pick any of that up i can vacuum run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair it would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet it seems to do that very well though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum shake the filter out etc because it gets clogged very fast	negative

everything about our miele \( red velvet \) vacuumn cleaner is top notch including the bags the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner this is just a small detail but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company s products	positive
this appliance has several good features but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast at the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown the other side barely toasted the inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side we did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread setting a timer for 1 minute pressing cancel reversing the bread and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again far too much work	negative
i just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum it cuts the cleaning time in half from 8 10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop and spraying the box down down to only 2 minutes it s just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes litter maid products i ve seen and the price is reasonable i wish i had this for my previous cats i ve owned	positive
in my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems my main beef is it s too hard to clean a few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up it has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank soaking in vinegar doesn t do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled the \( phosporic acid based \) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing and there s the hitch you can t reach parts of the element not even with a toothbrush why they couldn t center it just a little further away from the edge of the wall is beyond my comprehension i spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart trying various methods of cleaning than with it running i wouldn t buy it again	negative

great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken amazon how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn t pack them well enough for shipping amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic i ve received two of those lovely surprises the first set i ordered and the replacement set oh boy i give up the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard they break amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement \( in this case \) so it s like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage are you feeling lucky if so then roll the dice	negative

for what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months i really like foaming soap because i have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there isn t the big mess to clean but i have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap i searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and cuisipro was about all i could find but within 3 months the pump started to stick and i have to manually move it up and down it s cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick	negative

when we first bought it it worked nicely and smoothly thought we do not need to buy another opener again boy were we wrong after the third use it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning reminds me of a car turning it s wheels will all smoke and noise but no results glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name	negative
my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can t beat the quality	positive
i bought a few of these collars out of desperation in the past my cats got out of any kind of safety collar within an hour of putting them on since i was moving recently i was especially afraid of the cats getting lost during the move or at our new home i bought these collars because of the reviews and everything that the other reviewers say is true the only thing i ll add is that one of my cats managed to chew through his collar over the course of several months but it s still the only kind i ll use for him at this price i can easily afford replacements	positive

a friend of ours bought this for us he owns several coffee shops and we were excited to have great coffee at home out of the box i needed to tinker with it for a while and had to refer to online chat rooms to figure out how to get it to work correctly the problem was that the coffee didn t stay perculating long enough in the top and then it shot down into the carafe i called bodum of north america and their customer service person was a surley they offered no help at all and had no idea what i was talking about which unless they totally disregard internet reviews was a lie several people wrote in online articles to cut down the tube that goes in to the carafe by small dimension i didn t do that but i learned that if you don t push the top down all the way it will work okay after i got it working okay it did make really good and hot coffee then the poorly designed flip top broke and bodum has never had it back in stock \( i wonder why \) then we got really sick of trying \( in vane \) to clean the inside of the carafe finally the annoyance of the thing as a whole overrode the quality of the coffee my advice is if you want really great coffee go to your local cafe for day to day coffee at home don t buy this it looks cool and does make good coffee but at a big price	negative
read the fine \( or missing \) print carefully this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets \( another 100 \) if you want to return this item they charge a restocking fee of 10 and also deduct for the shipment \( even if you got free shipping \) and you pay to ship the thing back we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores which is where the miele came from	negative
i already had a cake lifter when i visited my daughter and her husband at christmas they were lifting a coffee cake out of the oven using two small spatulas i knew how much easier it would have been with the cake lifter so i wanted to get one for them googled spatulas and was amazed at how many there were finally found one just like mine and ordered two of them one for each daughter i have given one hers and she was delighted will give the other one hers when i visit in march i use mine often and am glad to have it don t believe enough people know there is such an item on the market too bad it isn t sold more widely	positive

the pump broke within 2 weeks and i haven t been able to find a replacement it would be under warranty but i threw away the paperwork \( my bad \) because usually i keep everything and then it just clutters up and i never have a problem however i still think the product should last a little longer than that i purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although i had tossed the box etc	negative
i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it i d looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior i broke a lot of rules setting this up its not connected to the hot water supply since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines also the machine is on the floor under the sink i bought new hoses to make the connections luckily the standard connectors on the back made this easy the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line and the drain can take a piece of garden hose i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water but so far its been okay \( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home i might not be so nonchalant \) my unit was used from an area where there was very hard water and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill the heating element and the wash arm and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal and away we went since we are in an office we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over if you pop the door open the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise if you load this machine carefully you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much and the machine will operate more quietly we ve found that we can run the machine have the office radio on and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble my only complaints would be that on occasion the timer has gotten stuck \( once or twice in 100 washes \) also some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater capacity is very decent probably because the machine is pretty large measure first	positive
having had a hoover in the past i was excited to find this one at this price i ve had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again and will not be looking at hoovers the parts are plastic and cheap and break easily it advertised a power hand tool it is not it works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning the upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months the hard wood floor tool worked fine and suction was strong enough but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments don t stay on like they should so i spend most of my time with the vacuum re attaching the pieces i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last	negative

i have just used this spinner for the first time in a long while now i remember why i avoid it it is nearly impossible to get the top and spinning basket to mesh and at the same time get the top with the handle to fit onto the bottom part the very few times that all has gone together and stayed long enough to get a good grip on the bottom the greens have come out nice and dry otherwise it s an exercise in frustration i hope that mine is defective or something because otherwise i must say pass this one by and find a different design or model and test it in a store before you buy it	negative
beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews	negative
i ve used this for indian food and it worked really well you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala btw i own other anolon advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup re the squishy handle if you have gripping problems as many middle age to older cooks do this helps you don t listen to the young self involved and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature	positive
i have owned a roomba for several years and have been very pleased with its performance so i was very excited to purchase the scooba however it has been the worst purchase that i ever made the first one that i received would quit working every time it bumped into furniture or the wall irobt did send a replacement but it only works about half of the time the other half of the time it does not vacuum up the dirty water so it leaves the floor dirtier than before i cleaned it i have contacted irobot for help but none of their suggestions have worked honestly i would throw it in the trash if it did not cost so much	negative

this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing it is luke cold i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave it is hard to clean and very loud	negative
i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i ve tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it s horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine	negative

i purchased this product in november 2003 and still have not had it installed the customer service is horrible i had questions and had a very difficult time finding a service company who knew anything about this haier machine i called customer service over five times and had to have corporate refer me to a company in indiana nobody i knew has had a combo and it has been frustrating dealing with the company i also did not know i could not return this product i honestly regret getting this machine it is pricey and not worth it i was looking forward to the space saving option but i rather have no machine than face the hassles and headaches i read a few negative reviews and do not look forward to the troubles ahead	negative
i ve bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories and found them to be sturdy remarkably well designed and easy to use unfortunately this timer is an exception it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point clock plus timer ten number keys for input memory etc but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers it s round like a traditional wind up kitchen timer it s solid feeling and has nice non skid feet on the bottom the problem is the display it s horrible for three reasons first the numbers are small smaller than any other timer i ve seen they re about 1 4 high half or less the size of those on comparable timers second the numbers are recessed 1 8 or more beneath a clear plastic cover not on the surface it s dark in there and feels like looking down a well it desperately needs a backlight but there is none unless the light source is shining directly into the display there s a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers but that causes the third problem the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective and it s virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn t a reflection shining back into your eyes the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer the light source and myself into a position where i can read the small dark shadowed and reflective display not what i need when i m trying to cook it s just not worth it since i have several other timers with displays i don t have to strain to read i use this one as a paperweight i d have to say it works very well i just don t understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door	negative
after spending 5 10 a day at starbucks my wife and i got the jura capresso for the convenience of a fully automatic machine and having fresh latte s at home in the morning we have used it for over 3 months now and like it more and more each week the espresso latte s and cappucino s are wonderful having to touch one button to have everything done at once is so easy but perhaps the best part is the self cleaning it does about once a week you clean out a tray and refill the water that s pretty much it desserts like affogato \( espresso on top of ice cream \) are a just too easy to make now downsides if you ever plan to reduce your caffeine consumption this machine is not for you my wife and i both drink more coffee now because it is so good and so convenient if you like really hot latte s the steamed milk won t get hot enough i d call it very warm or slightly hot just right for drinking but by the end it can be kind of cool warm up the glass with the hot water option before fixes the problem espresso coffee and even cappucino s come out at a perfect temperature	positive

this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup eliminating the scoop step it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate along with cup amounts the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on however anyways bottom line it grinds great with little mess	positive

the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan	negative

yes it is pretty no it is not a good teapot i have made tea for over 40 years in all sorts of pots and this is right up there with the worst it drips a lot perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout and no it does not drip from the spout rather lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot this happens with both fast and slow pouring with full and near empty pots this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot just too much mopping up	negative
okay i haven t used this while reading in bed yet but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting it s great the light isn t good for areas that are adequately well lit so don t bother to use the light there but in areas where light is dim the light shines literally it casts a bright light on the page \( s \) that you need to view it s helped me tremendously get through pages of reading yes it s a bit pricey for what you get but it s incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go the power adapter however is a cumbersome brick as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for i can t offer an estimate of time yet but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so cumulative not consecutive hours so no complaints yet about that whenever i saw this light online or in the store i used to think why in the world would i ever want something like this now my thoughts are why didn t i ever think to buy this before	positive

i recieved this rack for christmas and i love it it looks great and my 4 year old daughter likes to use it too the only thing i don t like is that it only holds 50 dvds and 2 racks look nice but any more than that is gonna look dumb i also like that the drawers pull out and sit on top for easy viewing	positive

i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address it worked for two days and then it stopped on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour but it only worked intermittently she didn t keep the receipt so i m writing it off as a waste of money when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense you can see when they are empty and you don t have to keep up with batteries i don t buy the argument that the hands free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands	negative

do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over nice work guys one call to their customer service line was cut off on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back unfortunately the mailbox was full i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service	negative

while this is an attractive looking paper towel holder it isn t very functional at first glance it looks like it should work as implied spring loaded arm puts pressure on paper towel roll regardless of how many towels are on that roll at the time allowing you to easily rip off a single sheet with one hand unfortunately this model doesn t work that way at least not the one i received i started with a partial roll and it was obvious this wouldn t work so i put in an extra large roll of top quality \( very thick roll \) paper towels and still they don t come close to reaching the spring loaded arm this arm is no more effective at preventing a number of sheets from pulling off the roll than the old wooden one i had with no arm at all i m very disappointed before deciding on this model i had viewed some very similar models that were higher in price maybe this is a case of you get what you pay for if you are looking for a paper towel holder that looks nice and are not concerned about function it may be worth the price if you are looking for one that looks nice and can offer you an easy one sheet at a time with one hand quick pull i suggest you look for a different model this unit won t do that job	negative
we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender the cuisinart took care of the problem pros very good power for blending good battery charge life easy to clean clever modular construction \( battery separates from motor built in plug and charger \) does not roll off counter cons larger and heavier than the corder braun this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 long the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth making clean up easy i don t recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft hand washing is easy and quick one reviewer suggested that cuisinart s recommendation of leaving the battery pack charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries this may shorten the battery life but the charger charges them at a very slow rate this protects the batteries from what really damages them heat from fast charging as the charger draws only 1 watt of current some may want to leave it plugged in continuously current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power don t run them down completely as was the practice in the past the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight they don t feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life	positive

my grandmother had one of these in her kitchen and i can remember all the kids fighting over who got to sit on the stool at large family gatherings i m really sorry that i let her s get away from us when she died i was so excited to see this stool on amazon and could not wait to get it but i returned it within less than 5 minutes of taking it out of the box first of all it is a lot smaller than you think my daughter s wooden highchair is larger than this stool but what really made me dislike it is the color to call it red is very misleading i would say it was closer to orange which doesn t appeal to me or match my kitchen	negative

after reading reviews on the wok s available on amazon com i decided on this wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher but it is very easy to hand clean the non stick surface has lasted but i am careful to only use plasic or wood and i wash it with a cloth and soap it gets to temperature quickly during cooking the only complaint i have is the simmer cycles \( not a constant heat but on and off \) i purchased some thai cook books \( real thai and thailand the beautiful cook book \) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a wok how easy it is to prepare my favorite food the difference the wok made i was able to cook at the correct temperatures my stove btu is apparently quite low it took forever to sizzle so the food turned to mush before it was cooked i now use the wok for anything i want to cook fast and or warm up	positive
the other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have it pales in comparison to my old hamilton beach however in several respects well really one big one it s a plastic object and it gets very hot too hot hot enough that it smells like it s melting itself i got this as a gift rinsed it thorougly boiled a pot just to clean it and it stunk like melted plastic ran it again to try and get the smell out same thing rinsed it with cold water and tried again still melted odor the outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off \( a problem i didn t have with my previous kettle which i lost in a move \) and when i touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger you can bet i put this right in the mail back to amazon i normally would hesitate to return a gift but i d rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust	negative
i usually like oxo products but this one is a real loser not only does it not give accurate readings \( which in itself should deem it useless being that it is a thermometer after all \) but there are other features that further enhance its horrible design first of all the handy \( so they claim \) spin dial that allows you to set the temperature that you want to reach is so flimsy that the slightest movement of the thermometer throws the dial off useless secondly after only one handwashing water seeped under the dial face which is impossible to get out the water then turns to steam which fogs up the display so you can t even read its inaccurate readings 2 weeks later there is still steam under the dial useless again and to pour salt on my already stinging wound i had emailed oxo to inquire about how to return this item and get a refund weeks ago but they have yet to respond to me even though on the package it states that satisfaction is 100 percent guaranteed well i am not a satisfied customer and if my second attempt to reach them proves fruitless once again then i doubt i will ever purchase another oxo product again no matter how good they are it pains me to even give this product one star as a product that s utterly useless deserves no star at all oxo should be ashamed of themselves thanks for allowing me to vent my 2 cents	negative
i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife she loves it our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or for that matter on the box it arrived in the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me the knives are well crafted have a great feel extremely sharp and we love them there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other we also love the selection of knives especially the paring knife and small serrated knife some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we ve not noticed either of these conditions	positive
the thermometer of this heater is completely messed up it does not measure the room temperature but the temperature of the air that has just been heated up in other words if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so \( according to the thermometer reading \) in less 2 minutes and stop if you do not use this functionality but instead let the heater run for some time \( 5 10 minutes \) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees the thermometer is probably in the wrong location did honeywell do any kind of testing before putting this model on the market	negative

while one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles i couldn t get it to work at all i tried it on two different shapes of bottles but to no avail the problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper doesn t slide when it s on the bottle when off the bottle the mechanism works fine it appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general at least that was my experience i found a good 3 00 stopper at sur la table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle it doesn t have the fancy pour spout but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne	negative

i loved this blender while it was working i mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit i love that it has seamless buttons so food can t get caught in little cracks i rarely used the food processor after about 11 months mine also started to smell like it was catching fire however it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar which was basically being shaved by the base motor i had to order a replacement blender cutting assembly from the cuisinart website for 15 with shipping only to have it happen again plus it was a pain to clean the base threading didn t match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult we ve replaced the blender with another brand but i have kept the bottom motor part for the processor	negative

we have 2 airedale terriers \( 55 lb dogs \) and 2 cats i originally bought a scat mat as a deterrent to the cats but it has since become a dog deterrent one of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we re not at home this is the only deterrent that has proven effective it keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down \( as she ll keep getting shocked if she stands there \) i feel comfortable using the product as i have been shocked by it many times myself \( generally i step on it by accident in the middle of the night \) make no mistake it hurts and you don t want to have it happen but it certainly isn t bad enough that i feel cruel using it this is my second scat mat as the other one stopped working because of that i m a bit concerned about the durability especially considering the cost that said however the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last \( no wires going to the battery that may become detached \) so i am hopeful that this one will last longer either way however it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money	positive

i do most of the vacuuming my wife s only request when i went looking for a new model was that it use a bag she absolutely hates the bagless models and doesn t want to see what we re pulling up we have two dogs \( an akita and a golden retriever \) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day so after searching i find this model i researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me i take the plunge and order it from amazon now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and i was shocked when it arrived in 4 the big thing i like about this unit is that the bags it uses \( although a little hard to find \) have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt the unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well and boy does it clean our rugs look fantastic one complaint i have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off another would be that you cannot turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position i know its a safety feature i just don t like it the pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades the little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas overall i would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from amazon was so positive that i ve purchased other items and make it my first place to look now	positive

ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months and it is fun weve already gone through a cleary water filter our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy and its fully programmable i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon water it down or add skim for a really nice froth i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime so far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past i should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides i would buy it	positive

cuts like a samurai blade quality and doesn t need to steel as frequent as the henckels wusthof knives it has excellent weight for a medium sized hand however the handles get quite slippery when wet so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety also if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel don t because this global blade is much harder than the henckels wusthof blades a qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must or if you really like the steel design get the global steel which can cost quite a bit overall this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed just like a samurai would do to get use to his sword	positive

this was one pattern that both my wife and i could agree on the design is clean and interesting and should fit with most decors i purchased two of the 16 piece sets from amazon for set and with the free vegtable bowles no tax and free shipping this was by far the best deal on the internet my first set arrived with two broken salad plates and one broken dinner plate my second set arrived with one broken salad plate the repacement set arrived with one broken salad plate the vegtable bowles arrived intact the quality seems to be first rate no warped plates or design flaws but a few item did have some minor cosmetic flaws amazon was great at resolving the damaged goods issues but needs to seriously rethink the packaging of fragile items the only fault i could find with this set is that the soup bowles are a little on the small side i recommend that you read and following the cleaning and maintenance directions and this set should give many years of service	positive

after the handle broke off the carafe that came with our krups aromacontrol \( after about 2 years of use perhaps several times a week \) i found this one and ordered it my belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off however i am perturbed that i had to go to the trouble of replacing it one would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components i am not entirely sure but it is possible that the plastic \( abs \) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured i searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem which is at the same time comforting and annoying upon receiving this carafe i was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it i prefer a certain heft and i assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made however this has proved not to be the case moreover the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing further i think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe \( inside \) on this model the advantage of this is that the coffee pours better \( a tighter stream not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe \) however i it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult in all it is superior to the original however i am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off i assume that they have fixed this problem in this model however i cannot be sure of this i also must say that it is a tad over priced and that perhaps might be a more reasonable price the only reason i did not get a new coffee maker is that the aromacontrol works well and makes good coffee \( i use illy \)	positive

bought this set at target 3 years ago for 200 and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them they re heavy cooked things well and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil \( metal etc \) in them that didn t belong in them took care when washing didn t burn things in them etc somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement because i didn t want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating they had to go straight to the trash very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life with high care and high cost the 2nd star is because they are beautiful and i cooked every day with these if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these they might work for you for me stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go i wouldn t even try another non stick finish	negative

a beautiful pan from kitchenaid i use it for everything and the lid is a big bonus think of it as a 10 skillet you use everyday which can also go into the oven and also be used for serving quality and heft is better than all clad	positive
glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter point to reidel anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable	positive
this is absolutely hands down the best toy we ve gotten for our dogs we own three sets of these in varying sizes because the balls are plush they will wear out this is not for your destructive chewers our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day before leaving for work pop a couple of treats inside and you re out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks	positive
did not work right out of the box the heating elements did not get hot so i had to return it otherwise i would be throwing money away do not buy	negative
i would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps currently they re working on chewing up the shelves so i m off to buy one that s entirely wire wish i had done that in the first place	positive
the first time i tried using this machine to make beef jerky it shut off in the middle of the process i had to stay next to it for 8 hours making sure it didn t shut off when it shut off i had to take the cover off and let the machine cool down and this happened about 15 times what a pain i called the company and they said that they would send me a new one but i needed to ship the old one to them at my cost what this is a brand new machine used once and i have to pay to ship the machine back buy a different machine	negative
i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail	negative
i like the idea of this bundt pan i made 3 batches of chocolate truffles on it the recipe that comes with the pan is awesome however i have yet to figure out how to get the chocolates out easily the first time i used a non stick spray \( not vegetable oil \) i thought that might be my problem because the company recommends vegetable oil on the next two batches i poured vegetable oil in the little holes and spread it around using a pastry brush again i had to fight to get the chocolates out i kid you not my husband pounded on the pan with a big rubber mallet to get the chocolates to come out i must be doing something wrong i will call customer service tomorrow but if there is a trick to this they should have told you on the instructions on how to make the truffles other than that the chocolates turned out beautifully and i will use this pan again even if i have to call my husband to help me out with his rubber mallet	positive
excellent when you want to bake a small cake this is absolutely a great small just the right size of a cake form	positive
poor carafe design makes this mr coffee machine a waste of money we bought this model to replace our old mr coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn t purchase a replacement for that model we loved our old mr coffee but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because as other reviewers have noted it s virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee water everywere after the first few uses we decided to purchase a different coffee maker	negative
the plates are modern and good looking always rate compliments from guestts i would like them more if they were a little bigger	positive
these tables are great i bought two of them solid wood classic design that will still look good in 10 years and easy no fuss assembly all this at a great price pick one up	positive
see other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning cool design but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press i only used this coffee maker 3 times and reverted to the press	negative
a year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash the swing out filter hinges broke during normal use once broken the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed hence it s ready for the wastebasket on closer inspection the entire filter unit is made of plastic and the hinges are only a few mm s in diameter sturdier design needed	negative
i love going to other peoples party s and sharing a few drinks but never had a good way to carry to bottles of bubbly or other drink of choice before this product i purchased an orange one last year and like it so much i m giving them as gifts this holiday season they fit almost any round or squire 750ml bottle \( absolute sky captain jose cuervo bushmills \) however oddly shaped bottles a bit of a tight fit like baileys	positive
so far this product is working fine has plenty of power heats food in a flash very good quality for the price i paid for i	positive
believe me i dearly wanted this pan to work out it costs well over 100 however no matter what i did everything i cooked in this pan stuck i tried using it without greasing it greasing it with oil spraying pam on it putting ghee butter in it etc the following things all stuck pancakes eggs hamburgers and chicken in fact every thing i tried stuck also the shape was strange as most of the surface area was off the heating surface also they have this 1 label on the bottom that was hard to get off i finally did but once i cooked something when i turned the pan over there was a microscopic film of glue from the label that i wasn t able to get off and it had turned brown ugggh this was the worst cooking experience of my life needless to say i returned this pan	negative
i could not resist trying this method of making espresso you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have there are a few tricks with the frother \( 1 milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile \) the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon pump it quickly and serve regarding the espresso maker itself just don t add any more water than to that line and oh don t open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done very quick and yummm	positive
we have some pretty nasty water from the tap but this pur filter system makes it taste so good i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once the hand held ones i ve used hold about 3 i don t know how pure the water is but it sure tastes great	positive
i bought this machine after researching it for a long time i could deal with the hard cleaning of it i was willing to shell out 100 00 for a good quality maker and i loved the design after two or three uses it started to leak after much searching i realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short i paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly i didn t return it i just will never buy bodum again	negative
the hoover floormate was great the first two times we used it along with the old english it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution after using it twice it had difficulty dispensing solution from the reservoir this was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly it still got the job done not too long after that it wouldn t vacuum the solution back into the unit i got a great clean for the price divided by four uses you do the math i ll stick to the cheap clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after i put the floor ex mate into the trash very disappointe	negative

i ve had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest replaced it with a 20 mr coffee 4 cup from walmart which eventually let water out the front the back the side etc creating a puddle just like the leaky braun threw that out and went to a 12 cup hamilton beach that i had received as a gift what a pos it had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also the crap leaked as well and when i lifted it water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor after reading reviews on the net and countless hours of searching for a good price i was ready to buy the bunn stainless steel i almost bought the bodum electric santos until i read that for some users the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature anyway while at target i spent an hour looking at coffee makers including the bunn which i really liked b c it is made in the usa i decided to buy this one just to test it out i like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning \( which the bunn does not ahve \) and a timer which also the bunn does not have the carafe is not bulky and has a no drip mouth also i have not seen any leaks so far but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter perhaps i should just remove the filter and not the basket the problem with most coffee makers is the steam after it condenses the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body anyway i also like the cool blue light in the front and the coffee takes good or as good as my braun which is what i ve been used overall i don t think it s bad for 40 bucks if it develops a leak i ll go buy the bunn if that also sucks i think i ll give up coffee for i ve had enough trying to find a good easy no drip leak \( no punn intended \) drip coffee maker	positive
i ve had this for over a month and i ve only made grilled chicken with squash and asparagus if you don t marinate your meat it will get really dry easy to clean most of the time	positive

this platter is much nicer than i was expecting larger too the glaze technique really looks beautiful on this piece and it will make a nice addition to my table setting it is well made without being overly heavy it came well packaged and arrived only 3 days after i placed my order with the free shipping thanks amazon for having the companion pieces i can t seem to find in any department store	positive

my roommate and i use this toaster daily and i ve never had problems with it the material is light but very sturdy i actually dropped it down my stairs when i moved and it still looks and works great i love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal i plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but i suspect that won t happen for quite a while	positive
i am a sous chef and i use this knife to break down everything from shell steak to veal chops and i love it i also like the flexibility of the blade it holds an edge very well with minimum touch ups overall i am very happy with the wusthof line edit 4 6 05 still using it still like new almost 3 years of almost daily use later can t beat wusthof	positive
pretty but started rusting on the edges after first wash would not buy these again	negative
this mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot i would expect to pay much more for such a product the grind is even and consistent the appearance is sleek and modern yet classic i would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift	positive

this is a great product for holding your knives my wife and i got a nice set of henckel knives as a wedding present i couldn t figure out how i could transport the knives along with the blade savers this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives	positive
this product is the worst there is i purchased it in a target store going by the oster name it takes forever for it to heat up and then another long wait for the waffle to be almost done needless to say i am taking it back	negative
look i suck at using a normal iron but after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on dry cleaners the results are pretty good as i have gotten better using it the results have gotten better plus there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others i just did a couple of long sleeve dress shirts and the results were good not perfect but good as others have said i wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with but once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge isn t really a big deal more height clearance would be nice though it won t be too long before it pays for itself and now i have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled plus i m pressing my golf shirts which typically didn t look that good after being washed but were too expensive to get dry cleaned i also just ironed an undershirt just for fun now that was an easy shirt to iron	positive
it is just like having a diaper genie for babies makes it much cleaner	positive
i bought this canister vacuum about 2 months ago and i absolutely love it it is quiet and i told my husband i swear it picks up the dirt off the basement floor from our living room i love the automatic rewind cord the cord is very long and i don t have to look for a plug in each room i vacuum i have all hardwood floors and two cats and it really keeps the hair volume in the bag the wands are sturdy metal i have gone through about 3 vacuums in the past two years due to plastic parts breaking thank you electrolux for the quality build of this vacuum the only thing that irritates me is i can not keep the attachments attached to the bend in the wand i finally gave up and put them in a drawer since i seldom have to use them spring and fall cleaning will be the only time more than likely i also wish the vacuum wands would stand by themselves when i have to leave the vacuum for one reason or another but it is still a 5 star even considering those two little things	positive
i received the food mill promptly and in perfect condition it was as stated by the seller	positive
using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day our family is hard on blenders after more than a year of daily experience with the waring pro \( both mbb pbb models \) i cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making here s why both glass stainless jug models use the same blade assembly this blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit it fails often and must be rebuilt or replaced parts are easily purchased if you re handy and have the correct tools details the assembly screws together and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart but this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit that it bends the metal washer below the blade the assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn the waring pro is all the blender than many people will need but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies	negative
i bought this unit a few years back worthless at best i wish someone even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units i called their customer service who said good luck as their best solution the problem is aluminum cools off too fast it will not retain heat i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake do they make them anymore ebay help	negative
the first time i used this waffle maker i was very disappointed and regretted the purchase however i gave it another chance the second time i used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great my husband said they were even better than the ones i used to make to avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out i lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it	positive
it does exactly what it says state of the art cutlery cutting vegetables becomes a pleasure it is stunning the precision of this knife you set it on the food push it and goes down the exact direction intended it did not go 1 1000 of an inch to left or to the right i used it for onion and let me tell you never in my life was so easy at the end the onion was so small chopped it felt like i was cutting air i even bought a kitchen electric chopper precisely to use it for cutting onions i do not need it anymore the design it is so sleek and elegant i felt in love with it only by seeing it on the picture after a research on the internet i bought it and i am not sorry i got tired to try and replace knives definitely i will buy the shun set i highly recommended like no other product	positive
this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines cute as a button it works the same as the large madeleine pans and is made from the same heavy weight metal but the result is darling would be great for tiny garnish on a larger dessert for a tea or just because some people prefer small doses of good things	positive
i have not tried to program the timer yet but as a heater this is one of the nicest i have had compact yet it puts out a nice even heat it is save in that the unit itself doesn t get red hot the ad says factory reconditioned yet it came in a new box and looks like new a super deal for auxiliary heating i use it to warm the livingroom to keep oil consumption down which it seems to have done so far without too big an increase in the electric bill	positive
i placed my first order for the red casserole in march it was not slated to be delivered until may but i waited patiently for it in may i see that it has finally been shipped and delivered to my house but i never received it so they send a replacement and it is white not red and apparently they no longer have red	negative
as others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years and no replacement parts to fix so the can opener has to trashed	negative
i love that it has a mini bowl so much less storage also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach i am so impressed love kitchen aid anything	positive
i purchased this reconditioned item primarily to toast english muffins which i eat regularly strangely i had to set it all the way up to its darkest setting \( 9 \) just to get the muffin to be somewhat browned i would routinely have to toast more than once to get the desired level of toasting i suspect there was something wrong with mine but who knows i returned my kitchenaid and ordered a krups toaster i am hoping for better results	negative
get a couple of good hones instead and learn to use them i got one of these a couple of years ago i figured i would now enter easy sharp knife heaven but it ruined all my knives they are sharp but only kind of sharp it ground the bevels to flat and i never managed to get anything that was remotely razor sharp and trust me i have tried anyhone who says razor sharp doesn t really mean razor razor sharp or may never have seen a really sharp knife if it isn t as sharp as that scalpel you used in biology class it is not razor sharp i recently bought the book razor edge sharpening and a couple of razor edge hones and hand reground all the knives i had ruined \( doesn t take long if you do it right even form a destroyed edge \) now i finally have the ultra scalpel sharp knives i always wanted so sharp it is almost scary good hones aren t cheap either but you can use them for your other tools too like chisels etc	negative
i must admit i m really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is it s still too early as i ve only had it for a month or so and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it s been given we have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with and so far there has been no problem i highly recommend this little guy and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place one suggestion though wonder how long it ll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model that way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode	positive
i think these little candle holders are great for any occasion and they aren t expensive either therefore you can buy any color for any occasion to match any room in your house these can be used for formal occasions or just everyday use	positive
i bought these for christmas presents for a few people and they loved them they were an incredible deal warm and appropriately sized they were so great that now i want to go back to get some for myself colors were great too	positive
it was nice to be able to purchase just one mug the delivery was quick	positive
i bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working i find it easy to insert the cans it works great if you follow the directions it s not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink it s a good buy	positive
i bought these because i was looking for nice red glass i m almost embarrassed at the size of them they are not practical but i paid so little it wasn t worth sending them back i recently saw them in bloomingdale s so maybe this is the new trend but they won t do anything for your wine	negative
i ve had my juicer now for about 3 years and i haven t had any problems with it in fact after having had several juicers this one is my favorite in the price range i also don t understand the customer service problems one of the rubber feet on the bottom split and i called customer service a week later i had four new ones in the mail pros much quieter than most juicers of its type as well i did a side by side comparison with my buddie s juiceman juicer and my yield was approximately 30 greater cons as with any other similar juicer cleaning it gets old that s probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times day	positive
i ve changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years i cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself that said i still have reasonable water pressure and here s the amazing thing my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it who knew that for all my life it was the water not my hair my skin is not as dried out if i could work out the little glitches it would be perfect i own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it s fab for the price	positive
ok well unlike the other reviewers i hate this ice cream scoop yes it s heavy and seems to be well engineered however i don t like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it and as another reviewer already mentioned it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed when i m scooping the ice cream the water drips out and down the handle thus making it even harder to grip the handle it makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and i get ice cream all over my hand i have a cheap 2 plastic scoop that i bought when i was in college and i prefer it to this one	negative
no stars i recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated but due to the leaking issues w the filter basket overflowing you may also notice that the water never completely drains staying at the 2 cup line causing mold milldew to grow \( despite proper cleaning maintenance \) this is the reason for the bad tasting coffee also the reason for my current various medical conditions i am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues i am being faced with please do not purchase any mr coffee sunbeam products this is the exact model i own but nearly every model has the same defective construction consumer complaints check the better business bureau consumer affairs you will be shocked at what you find about mr coffee sunbeam they have almost gone bankrupt from class action lawsuits more than once if anyone has a similar situation with any mr coffee brand coffee makers please contact me asap my email address is angidougherty yahoo com people are suffering because of this hazardous product may not even know it toxic mold poisoning is very serious can be deadly especially through drinking it in your morning coffee yum	negative
we received the zephyr as a wedding gift ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo the handle on ours is brass instead of chrome it heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup o noodle much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there my wife and i are very pleased with this tea kettle	positive
i found this same item at a target store in stock for only 39 99 they also have it for sale on line for the same price it s a great chair	positive
this was a special offer and the price seemed excellent description stated standard classic white goose down feather pillow a more accurate description would have been mostly feather pillow with some goose down skimpily filled i would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate i e larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content as they did with other catalog items i believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was caveat emptor	negative
this coffeemaker is a huge disappointment the stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere and if you do not use additional paper filters you get coffee grains in summary a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee the plus the water filter but that is it	negative
this looks like a good idea from westinghouse but if you read the warranty details the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10 year warranty 10 00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years but not really what is the point extra tape isn t even included when the first strip fails i suggest you use a flashlight	negative
i am totally unimpressed with this set of bowls i received them a few days ago and washed them and one has already managed to crack after falling of the drying rack and into the sink a melamine bowl should be far sturdier than this the orange measuring cup bowls towards the center are nice but the outer bowls are rather flimsy	negative
if you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner then you will love this one i bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large \( and heavy \) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair because of the small bagless chamber you have to empty it frequently so i wouldn t count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner i wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs specifically to pick up pet hair and this vacuum exceeded my expectations i tried the shark a similar model made by fantom and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does \( stay away from the fantom cordless by far the worst \) i don t think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did overall this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean ups or to maintain pet hair free area rugs one suggestion use the carpet setting even on bare floors the brushes are high enough so they won t scratch bare floors but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush i found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless i used the carpet setting the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying	positive
i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money	negative
not the best sheet experience my legs broke out in a rash best to wash before using i guess the thread count is a bit lacking too for microfiber sheets i want a cloud like surface i will go for a higher priced item next time	negative
the machine looks great it sat nicely on our counter top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy if that was all i wanted to do with it then i would have been very happy with it but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos firstly i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use it rotates but has little movement up or down as a result i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter top when i was finished it produced good foam though secondly the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not finally the espressos i made had no crema at all i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere in summary if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter buy this machine if you want to make decent espresso based drinks don t	negative
i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk it is great if you like to make lattes or just plain expressos it brews fast less than two minutes it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes	positive
i have used this vacuum for over a year now i consistently have trouble with the belts staying on i cannot count the number of times i ve had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts if it even rolls over something uneven on the floor the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving also although bagless sounded great this vacuum is very very messy to clean out i have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere it also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments i write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached i have taken this vacuum apart for the last time	negative
after reading some of the previous reviews about shipping damage i almost didn t order it however it arrived in great shape and the packing material was excellent someone must have gotten sanyo s attention on the quality of their packing material	positive
our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs	positive
i have used patton air circulators for the last twenty years and if you are looking for something much more effecient than the common box fan that you see in department stores this is really a fan the first one i bought had the c f m rating on it which was 9600 they don t put that on the fan anymore but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate some air and can be adjusted to blow straight up nothing i have seen even comes close for the money	positive

this mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months it would work one day and then not work the next whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today no matter what the features an appliance has that rates an automatic 1 star in my book	negative
i ve lusted after a super auto for years when i finally decided to get one i did a fare amount of investigating the gaggia titanium had the best spec s for the price and good reviews i decided to spend the extra money for the stainless unit i haven t seen the painted plastic model so i can t comment on the appearance i do think the stainless looks great you can find reviews of the non stainless here on amazon and other than the outside appearance the device is the same i ve only had the unit for a few days but so far i m very happy to the negatives first the manual is awful it s not just the italian to english translation the text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great i spent a fair amount of time making sure i understood how to setup and use the unit i m pretty technically savvy and in the end i figured it all out but don t rush into using this product until you ve figured out how to set it up clean it and adjust all the settings \( there are many \) the only issue i ve had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it s empty when it s not open the lid \( which could be a bit better designed \) and stir and it works could be the beans i m using not sure it s an intermittent issue the good stuff once you figure out the coffee strength and grind the gaggia makes a delicious cup i wish the brew were a tad hotter \( i have it set to max \) but using the cup warmer helps no issues making froth with the wand much better than the older manual machine i had you can t put a huge mug under the unit \( the max size is 4 5 inches \) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed you can set the unit for the amount of brew however i found that clicking the large coffee button twice the unit thinks it s making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug it s much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size you get a nice foam on top and as i said the coffee is outstanding i love the clean up \( or lack of \) compared to the drip maker i had \( a bodum vacuum unit \) i still have that unit should i need to make a lot of coffee for company but for the two mugs i drink in the morning the gaggia easily replaces this unit and there s far less cleanup the grinds sit in a canister and after a few days you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse so you can use this gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you re making a cup or two what i love is just pressing a button twice \( for two large coffees \) and walking away from the unit a minute later a great cup of joe it truly is super automatic i have the unit set for energy savor whereby it s in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after i use it i only drink in the morning however if you decide to wake it up it heats up in about 2 minutes it also does a rinse cycle so i keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water there is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days there s also a full rinse cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir it s a menu item so don t select it unless you really want to do this \( takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire \) yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks i m very happy update the issue with the grinder was the beans \( too oily \) i called the ny office and got someone in tech support in minutes she knew her product sure enough the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area	positive

after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf with an interesting pattern on the crust my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf and much more rustic natural than using a loaf pan the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old fashioned way when it s done rising carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre heated bread stone in the oven the loaves look and taste great	positive

while the wine pourer works as advertised i am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper i was originally seeking i was after the pourer that came with a flapper at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings while the above item fits the bill as a spout i personally find it useless	negative
ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob i am more of a coffee nut i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose and for a guy like me this machine is perfect i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4 5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret i have had the machine about 3 weeks now i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient and dont get me wrong the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had very quickly but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for be it a straight shot a cappucino or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you may not be good enough for a coffee snob but just right for a coffee nut oh and one hint i found very helpfull turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it \( the longer the better \) with your cups up on the warmer i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso	positive
well i have a toy poodle and he goes crazy when he hears someone at our door we live in a tiny studio in nyc so if he hears someone going into their apt in the middle of the night he goes crazy and wakes everyone up after a lack of sleep and total frustration i got this collar it work until one night i woke up to horrible noises when i saw that my dog had attempted to slip the collar off and because of all his fur the collar was able to slide partially off but not all the way leaving the electric part in his mouth and when he whined it electrocuted his mouth so i quick unhooked it and couldnt stop freaking out so my boyfriend said that its not a bad shock its just a quick pinched so i tryed it on my neck and my god was it powerful it burned and paralyzed your whole area i made my boyfriend try it to just so he couldnt say i was being a p ssy we threw it right out after that i didnt even want to resell it or get my money back because i would feel too guilty giving it to anyone else my suggestion is that you get just a sound correction device with no electric correction because i learned first hand its really not humane or a spray collar that shoots out a spray of citranella or something	negative
i bought this to hold some of my overflow knives that would not fit into my knife block it has proven to be very handy it seems well made im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot but it is sturdy and nice looking it occupies about half of a drawer which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it i have now switched its intended purpose slightly insead of just holding the overflow from my counter top knife block this now holds my most commonly used knives the real knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the overflow from this one	positive

i bought one of these for my apartment and it s quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it s a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show with that in mind it s a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor \( particularly for indoor environments \) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty s respiratory system	positive

apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new s5 series of miele vacuum cleaners the features price and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models nor even across series many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones they have fancy names like capricorn red velvet and champagne leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car if your browser has tabbed browsing \( e g firefox \) the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele s website and open a tab for each model you re interested in flip back and forth to see what text changes callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series \( newest technology motor \) that still comes with an electronically powered brush \( the 4th pisces model is turbo \) after 3 months of extensive use pros agility the 10 wide seb217 3 electric powerbrush comes standard and one of the reasons i chose this model for me smaller is better while other vacuums advertise large 13 power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe i don t have much open carpet space coffee tables chairs weight benches and computers all need vacuuming around and under the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners brush duster the most commonly used attachment \( for me \) the brush duster is also small \( slightly larger in diameter than the hose \) and the bristles are durable it s angled by default but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out this is not mentioned anywhere you just have to figure this out for yourself on low power i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk parquet floor brush initially i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included but this wider brush duster actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better on the negative side you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for genuine horse bristles there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don t get separated for life \( the powerbrush takes precedence \) cord rewind the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time something like 15 for 15 times \( the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat \) cons price after all it s just a vacuum cleaner there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s5 series at least when i bought this everywhere i checked \( maybe 10 websites \) the price was exactly 799 or 799 95 with the only difference being no tax and or free shipping one website even advertised the lowest price allowed what s a diamond dealer is this amway release buttons the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive being on the part that comes off rather than on the part that stays behind therefore you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with the hose extension button is particularly confusing it s an oval shaped rocker button that rocks very little to extend the stainless steel hose you have to remember which side of the button \( top or bottom \) to press there is no distinction on which side to press and it s always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button stiff no swivel hose the hose rotates at the top \( handle area \) but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists i d rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists the flex hose diameter is larger than i m used to making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner considering the price an electrical slip ring would have been nice bag full indicator the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full right out of the box on short carpet it indicated bag full on high power as i turned the power down it indicated less full sequentially you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator even at that there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator extra stuff the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose \( button doesn t easily click into place \) the extension isn t needed to connect the parquet brush so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it to this day i still haven t figured out what the extension is for other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life \( along with the parquet brush normal filter cage and replacement bags \) symbol marking the power symbol markings are not obvious at all contrary to claims other than the symbols labels min and max you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise the quite mode is 4 of 6 settings \( with 6 being the highest \) and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the normal operating mode i think most people will consider max the default mode optional filter frame this model comes with a hepa filter so you don t need the filter frame unless you re going to switch to the normal filters but brand new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping you don t even need the handle for the frame to function properly but for the kind of money i paid nothing should be broken out of the box the vendor that i bought it from \( best vacuum \) replaced it for free so is it worth 800 it does a good job but only time will tell	positive
take a look at the ingredient list alcohol is first then water this product doesn t do anything more than plain old rubbing alcohol does except for make you about twenty bucks poorer regarding some of these reviews smells like rubbing alcohol why yes that s because it is stings yes it s rubbing alcohol someone recommended a spray bottle for easier application well yes \( and duh \) what a better way to fly through an expensive product that would last much longer if you used cotton balls unless you ve got money to burn it s just nonsense to buy this i used it and noticed no difference between it and rubbing alcohol except the price	negative

this hamper is okay but amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it i ordered four and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse how did they arrive in four giant shipping boxes each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags it took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags i live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce and this really an insult to me and to the environment there is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper according to the packing list the shipping cost on each was 6 which means that due to supersaver amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of 5 per hamper amazon shame on you you could have shipped all four in a large envelope	negative

i have been using these filters for years my first impression with them is that they are very expensive my second impression is that they might not work as well as i thought they did i recently bought a water distiller and i have been experimenting with different sources of water in it i have used hot water directly from the tap cold water directly from the tap and brita filtered water in the distiller the brita filtered water left the most residue in the distiller which is very disconcerting the filters let out small amounts of carbon all the time into the top of their proprietry resevoir in the directions it says to slowly add water to the filtering well which is what i do but it still leaches at least thirty little pieces of carbon in the prefiltered water i want clean water not water with small pieces of carbon floating in the filling well i have always wanted to believe the filters were working but now am very skeptical	negative

many of you reading these reviews may be wondering how this compares to similar items made of cast iron i can tell you that while it obviously isn t cast iron and for that reason alone many will say it is inferior it is still an excellent griddle the bottom is very heavy and it conducts heat well it fits perfectly over 2 burners on one side of my gas stove i ve cooked several sandwiches at once on it as well as pancakes and some eggs and the heat seems to distribute very evenly i was very impressed with this aspect of the griddle as cast iron is known for its even heating and i was wondering how an aluminum griddle would hold up it definitely does a fine job the bonus of course is the nonstick surface and it s a good one not some chintzy teflon coating good quality construction the handles are solid and it doesn t feel cheap at all when you hold it take care of this griddle \( make sure it doesn t get scratched \) and it will take care of you	positive

i destroy cooking pots i m especially lethal to the light weight teflon lined variety you ll find at the supermarket my secret is simple i like to cook on high heat and i get easily distracted that guarantees that i ll forget what s on the stove and produce a scorched \( and warped \) utensil if a lightweight teflon pot lasts me two years it s extraordinarily lucky i now own four \( different \) swiss diamond pots and even my brutal habits leave them unimpressed despite regular disasters they seem to shrug off what would vanquish a lesser pot \( admittedly i do avoid metal spoons and spatulas and clean them with non abrasive means \) they have excellent non stick characteristics superb heat spreading and love it are approved for very hot oven use adding up to essential cooking tools and when you factor the price of regularly replacing cheaper pots their cost becomes more than bearable highly recommended	positive

i ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback we followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee after that the machine said ventilate we followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself went to make another cup of coffee and it said ventilate this time it would not fix itself i tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray turn off the knob and ventilate comes back up on the screen turn the machine off and turn it back on ventilate came up on the screen we called amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later \( thank you amazon \) unfortunately this one i did not get cup one out of the machine it read ventilate as soon as i turned it on the difference is with this one no water would come out at all gaggia provides no customer support so you are on your own with this unit	negative

i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up big people food for my grandson it could not even grind up a soft hot dog we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material \( painted gray to look like metal \) it just couldn t do the job sheesh i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder total waste of money also my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two junk	negative

i heard about the lids and hoped that they would be a good alternative to plastic wrap i even bought two for gfts but they didn t live up to my expectations the large size didn t even fit on standard size bowls and the small one didn t fit on small bowls i would return them except that i threw out the original packaging i don t recommend this product	negative
i m impressed with the quality of these towels i purchased them because i needed hunter green and could not find that color locally they are large soft absorbent towels	positive
does what it claims to elegantly but small leaf particles get through the filter takes time for tea to brew	positive
well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic	positive
i bought the machine about 2 weeks ago and it took me about 5 min to read the instructions and use the machine sorry but one would have to be an idiot not to understand how to use it i love its versatility e g espresso coffee or pods regular water or add bottle \( for those whose tap water is bad \( comes with an adapter \) \) froth maker for capuccino or steam water for tea it sure will draw wows from your friends as long as you remember to run a cup of water through before each time you use it your espresso should be the perfect temperature took me some time to realize why it was lukewarm the only bad thing \( why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars \) i have to say about the granos is that in order to remove the portafilter i e the part with the handle holding the coffee you have to use force but maybe after a few months it will loosen up a bit and things will be easier all in all i am completely satisfied with its user friendliness crema temperature and versatility	positive
we ordered a cherry coat rack \( keep in mind cherry is the only color option available on this site for that item \) and it came as light oak i tried to get it exchanged but they were going to make me pay for shipping cause it wasnt their fault i dont know whose fault it is but i ordered a cherry i got something totally different and their customer service didnt service me and wasnt customer friendly never again	negative
this is by far the best toaster we ve ever owned it does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional so i don t know how it works yet but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side a fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation the bagels we toasted in it were just perfect the microwave is large enough inside for my purposes which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting i never use microwave popcorn so i can t say how well it does in that area but the frozen burrito i cooked last night came out terrific regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving i think what the company is referring to is the fact that while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster this does indeed save space not to mention an electrical outlet overall i m very pleased with it but haven t had it long enough to speak to its longevity i can tell you that it s almost worth buying for the toaster alone	positive
i recieved this from my husband after he got it as a gift at a secret santa party it is a really beautiful set and all the candles and accents matched what was advertized i set it up in my office \( in a different pattern from what was shown \) and it really adds a nice touch especially with its blend of soothing smells my only complaint is that one of the glass stones was broken in half and the other half could not be found it probably slipped through the quality control department at the factory but it had plenty of others to compensate so it s not a big deal i highly recommend this product especially if you like to customize and design your centerpieces rather than have them pre assembled	positive
i was looking for a tiered cake stand to display cupcakes for a wedding shower and couldn t find one that was priced right and had flat tiers \( there are many towers specific for cupcakes only \) i finally found this one and it worked out beautifully a guest from the wedding has asked where to get it for herself i highly recommend it	positive
i have been looking for one of these for a couple of weeks for the price i thought it would work great first it was the size of a salt shaker \( did not read description well enough \) second upon first use while trying to apply a coating of powdered sugar on my funnel cake i thought i was going to throw my shoulder out the sugar just will not come out of the fine mesh in the lid i had higher hopes for this unfortunately it is now packaged for a return journey back to amazon and i am continuing my quest for the perfect funnel cake shaker	negative
ok so i thought i was crazy not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot people were making fun of me how can you burn anything in a crockpot now i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot now i know that they are not supposed to be like this do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours i am trashing mine today	negative

i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i d buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one	negative
i just got into wine a little while ago and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler but seeing as how i m anywhere near wine snob status i didn t want to spend a bunch on a set enter the riedel o glasses they were on sale great price for two glasses they arrived and i m happy with them they re sophisticated enough to be wine glasses but without the stems they re not snobby either i would have given this 5 stars but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim almost a little bubble of glass or crystal other than that they re great	positive
giving 2 stars on the suction alone hepa filter doesn t self clean turn after one use a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you don t pay very close attention to aligning it just right i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it s heavy and dirt just falls out a lot of dirt when emptying the dirt box i m returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience	negative

i just received this wine tower the other day it looks as wonderful in my home as it does in the picture it s perfect for our needs and takes up so little space the only complaint i have and why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 it was a pain for my husband to put together also it came with 2 bottom shelves instead of one bottom and one top he had to improvise until i can get this corrected with the manufacturer \( fortunately it s not noticeable \) in spite of this i recommend this wine tower for anyone wanting an expensive looking wine tower that is so space efficient at this price i ve already gotten compliments on it from friends	positive
i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone the coffee does taste funny and i didn t realize it might be the metal pot also do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out just like one of the other reviewers said the pot does not slide in and out easily not a coffeemaker i would recommend the only thing i like about it is the size	negative
after two months a piece of the filter broke off after 3 months the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website so i could pay another 30 or so for a new carafe because glass is not included in their warranty no thanks	negative
i ve had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sight protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger made mostly for show blocks would if you re looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger that s just my opinion i could be wrong	positive
i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go what a disappointment they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments trust me if you have to choose between the two don t spend your money on on cs2 however it may appeal to the \( human \) avid bird watcher \( \)	negative
recently purchased this in mid 2006 and it is the best cookware item i have ever owned and used as one of those millions who rely on mid line priced discount department store brands i can state with 100 certainty i was amazed \( and still am \) with the high performance this item offers the clean up is still a dream come true all i have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse it practically cleans itself my burners are all equal size \( gas stove \) and highest setting is 6 i have learned all i have to do for pancakes is level 3 cooking bacon an entire pound is no problem for this cookware i do want to purchase more of this item there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available i m even thinking of slowly switching to this brand all clad nonstick	positive
i bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by mens health magazine none of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots don t line up just right the mug will not work i have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation	negative

first off i paid 25 00 for this at walmart so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for 54 00 secondly it works fine for the amt of money i spent thirdly my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it i will have to put ear plugs in seriously this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm i have an email in to eureka com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to	negative

absolutely fab shiny bright stainless steel matches frieling french press and any other stainless tableware countertop items perfectly just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so of course the sugar bowl holds plenty note you ll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go around at a table seating 4 6 coffee lovers overall these are just very sturdy solid clean up beautifully and very easily and by the way the sugar spoon included with the lid covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar and sets inside the little notched area of the lower bowl so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered on at the same time a really simple yet european engineered well thought out design quality i fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me down although it s a l o o o ng time until i ll be distributing my assets make sure to buy the matching frieling french press it s just incredible also heirloom quality give yourself the gift of european quality coffeeware it s one of life s simple yet indispensible indulgences ps the frieling french coffee press w this matching sugar creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too	positive
this is probably my favorite mug it easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup it comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim the best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over even hard corners don t seem to phase it it s also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat s efforts to tip it over the odd shape also has downsides though it won t fit in any cup holder i ve ever come across but that doesn t matter much since it won t tip over no matter where you set it if you don t rinse it out immediately it can be difficult to clean later due to the shape if you don t have small hands you may need a bottle cleaning brush also i imagine if you had more than one of these mugs they d be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space despite this it s still a great mug in fact i m going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too	positive
i would not recommend purchasing these sheets they are thin not very soft and they wrinkle easily	negative

i am not fond of this particular microwave because of the loud clunky sound of the door opening poor in my opinion i can t believe that i will probably put up with this for years as i use my microwave several times a day my husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input like power buttons in the upper left corner most used buttons should be large maybe in a special color i like the web 2 0 look that is developing on user interfaces no user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought i asked my husband what was the brand name and he said sharp so even if cheap i think sharp ought to protect the brand image but i see that i am in the minority of opinions here maybe my advice is not order on line till you try this item out	negative

it is a very lovely two piece set and amazon shipped it to me twice and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards i gave up but from what i could tell from the remains this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear i m not sure considering the shipping problems whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher	negative
this was given to us about last christmas to replace our old one not worth it a couple months into our ownership of this item it stopped working properly the right burner remains on at all times we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off so the right burner remains on hi all the time and the left burner is either lo or hi there is no concept of temperature control with this device if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things if it s a centimeter above medium it s hot if you want medium heat to work good luck it worked ok until it broke however it was never especially powerful i can t even tolerate trying to cook with it anymore i just go to the apartment downstairs and cook on my boyfriend s mom s gas stove for nice even heating but a ministove that they are dubbing professional should not be breaking after like three months	negative
i ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic however this kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water i boiled it a few times plus tried the water vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help i decided that i didn t want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so i m returning it it s not worth the risk i can t figure out if it s coming from the stainless steel bulb \( that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it \) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass the bulb plus the lid has a stong odor too that is plastic covered in stainless steel	negative

i bought this for my husband three years ago and he absolutely loves it in fact many people who come to our house ask about it as the coffee is superb we are very picky about our coffee tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years i would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model the coffee is usually hot throughout the day \( depending on how much is in it of course \) as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee we have never had the first problem with boilovers leaking implosions \( huh \) etc in fact i m getting one for my daughter and her husband for christmas as they always admire ours	positive
i have the black fusion in my home office \( which is next to a basement level theater room \) and my wife and i already love this machine we have tried all sorts of mixes and we ve only scratched the surface of what this machine can do this is one of the first times i ve been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it physical properties it handles travel mugs \( if you remove the drip tray which is largely unneeded anyway \) and all our standard mugs the drink head moves up and down so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks \( more common with frothy drinks than coffee and tea \) when it brews a filterpack it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out \( and thus keep it from dripping as you remove it \) the water tank could be larger \( if only because we re so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long \) but if you have a ready source of water nearby it shouldn t be a problem the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo \( which we also have \) flavor wise it s made by m m mars so you can bet that the sweeter drinks \( the so called indulgence fare \) is excellent coffee blends are quite good especially the darker roasts like french roast and sumatra lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks moreso than other chains clean up wipe the inside of the drink head and possibly the front of the plastic column \( the colored portion \) after any particularly splashy drinks no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug of course you can t watch its magic when the drink head is that low so your first few times you ll probably get a drip here and there final bits we ve had the senseo since its launch between pods that need pre wetting to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not so great varieties of drinks the senseo is lagging behind the flavia we drink coffee tea espresso drinks mixed blends and sweet tooth friendly indulgence mixes every day with the flavia and it s brain dead easy to use certainly easier to clean up after too if you re on the fence between the flavia and other single cup offerings \( like senseo \) get the flavia keurig and other single cup offerings can t touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia i m sipping a lemon blueberry tea blend now made over ice and it s fantastic highly recommended	positive
i bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don t work well the manual is not thorough but it does tell you after you bought the product that there is a one second delay unless you buy an ac adapter i just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn t about to buy an ac adapter to see if that fixed it it cut off my mom s voice and i rarely heard her message the units also have annoying beeps that can t be turned off no real volume control either a very overpriced and poorly designed unit also the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them the sound is clear if it doesn t cut you off but the units are far from user friendly	negative

i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away she would use a flashlight to do little reading well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes but it does do the job	positive

my wife and i are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats though the catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with sanisolution and granules it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement unfortunately they just don t work becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 catgenies even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly they clogged everytime and beeped incessantly another problem is the scoop even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle it always left turds behind those turds would then go through the whole cyle which includes drying that means that even if they re scooped up the next time it cycles they re going to be so dry and hard they ll never be ground up properly again this results in clogs we had them for a little over 2 weeks in that time we had to run extra cyles backflush and even take them apart and clean them this product results in far more work not less	negative

for 19 99 you ll not find many knife sets i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife this set includes a long slicer utility knife one large paring knife and a 5 or 6 serrated knife the knives consist of good steel comfortable grips and are well balanced they are very sharp and sturdy i couldn t find a better set for the price i was looking for a decent utility carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set i use mine as the disposable knives for this price you won t have to worry about beating up on them and they sharpen up quickly too the red color is very festive the grips feel like silicon so they work when wet and greasy and pleasantly squish when you grip hard if you are in the market for a fine high level kitchen knife these may not fit the bill but if you are looking for good quality inexpensive knives you won t find better in this price range i paid 19 99 dec 200	positive
impressive machine overall i ve had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch looking around on the internet this seems to be fairly common i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine the attachments are great for hard floors and furniture i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point even the refurbished one	positive

appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and watch out for that hot plate burner it s a bit tough on the fingers if you weren t expecting the carafe to be heated basically this is a good coffeemaker just not quite worth the price tag for that amount of money i expected something more	positive
i am glad i only paid 60 for this i see it s now up to 90 i am a bit disappointed in this purchase it does slice well so far \( although i haven t tried slicing anything really thin like prosciutto yet \) but i don t like the fact that i have to hold the on button down with one hand while cutting i also found that when i used it to slice homemade bread that the slices get stuck in between the blade and the plastic guide at the bottom so i have to stop and dislodge each slice sometimes tearing them in the process i also don t like how loud it is and the fact that it sounds like it is working really hard all the time it makes me question how long the motor is going to last the catch tray is really useless \( as someone else pointed out \) and in addition to not doing it s job it doesn t store inside or attached to the machine in any way so it just kind of gets in the way if i decide to keep the machine i am going to throw it away so all in all i gave it two stars because it is a cheap slicer \( or at least it was at 60 i am not so sure at 90 \) but it works like a cheap slicer too so you are definitely getting what you pay for	negative
we tried littermaid and still use it in our motor home but we absolutly love the cat genie for our 2 spoiled and large cats we would not only buy it again we re getting one for my sister for her birthday and recomending it to everyone we know with cats we ve been using it for the past 5 months and it has clogged twice an easy clean up and fix much less hassle than the litter maid and no smell or dealing with overflowing cartridges or my dh s attempts to modify the littermaid so it will hold more or use bags or boxes etc which never work and make a smelly mess every now and then the soap box will jiggle loose and might need a tap to re seat it but you get a beep to warn you now if they would only make a smaller cat genie for the rv	positive
these sheets were the color size and quality described however if you tend to roll over instead of picking yourself up when you turn over while sleeping your sheets will very quickly begin to ball yes those tiny little balls you get on the clothes you wear within about 6 8 weeks the sheets have balls on the areas were the most friction happens they are otherwise great sheets but they don t act like egyptian cotton they are thick warm but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill \( soft twill mind you \) but they don t feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets i paid more money for pay for the real thing if you want soft non balling sheets	positive
i internet shopped for a week reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast easy job ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal the pitcher is thick solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 yes just 2 speeds i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous	positive

i ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time i was sorely disappointed there is no measuring cup so all water amounts must be estimated \( the unit has three lines to help but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs \) there is no buzzer when the unit is finished so unless you babysit it everything ends up overcooking this is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled	negative
my husband loves cereal for breakfast and i bought it so he doesn t have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal it was a perfect fit for him and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses i was surprised at how big it was but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful the rubber turn knob doesn t jam up as easily as i expected although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense only complaints 1 the top plastic covers are not completely airtight but are fine for dry cereal 2 the bottom rubber covers fall out easily they should fit more snugly	positive

using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing and it requires a finer ground than what auto drip machines ask for after the water is brought to a boil it s important to wait for it to cool just slightly \( about 30 seconds \) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter wait for them to drain and then fill the pot with water want more than a single cup of coffee you wait for your first pour to brew and then fill the filter again some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing 1 taste i don t know how it does it but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter 2 cleanability users can keep all necessary components clean \( anyone who s brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn t there when you bought it understands this plight \) oftentimes the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it s not possible to get your hand into the reservoir some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot but if you re like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass then you need some good ol fashion friction to get it clean the best thing i ve found a baby bottle cleaner it s narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls too brilliant 3 electricity free as long as you can boil water you can have coffee 4 mud sludge french press and stove top espresso style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee don t get me wrong i think that s good \( i use a french press when i m in the mood \) but the cone on a chemex doesn t allow that at all 5 style size the chemex coffee pot is a relic \( designed in the 40s \) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it s a wonderful minimalist sight on any kitchen counter \( and unlike electric coffee makers easy to move if you need the space \) some drawbacks any purchaser should consider 1 time it does take 5 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee 2 cones you can t run over to wal mart when you use the last filter you need to find a specialty store or go online which means you need to plan ahead 3 cold coffee no electric hot plate \( thank god \) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop i think that s more labor added to an already laborious endeavor just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee 4 learning curve it does take some time to get the grind right the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue 5 cleanability i know this is in the advantages column as well but it s worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff \( which is a small pain \) else it will get nasty over time	positive

this product is a poorly designed piece of crap that is destined to fail from the first day you use it a friend had purchased this item a few months back and asked me to look at it when it died recently \( i have been repairing electrical and electronic equipment for almost 30yrs \) this is a perfect example of a throw away item if more care had gone into the design and a few more dollars into producing it you might have a product that could last a few years neither was done look at how many reviews mention the item failing after only a few months and even the positive reviewers usually have only been using it for a month or so do yourself a favor and buy a commercial grade hot plate from a reputable manufacturer you will pay more but you will likely still be using it many years from now \( not too mention that the operation will be better also \) how much value is in a 20 hot plate when it is headed to the landfill a few months from now it is a shame that so many people are willing to accept low quality products these days and think it is ok if it lasted a few months \( note the reviews \) good luck	negative

i have really enjoyed the quality of all of my other cuisinart cookware unfortunately this tea kettle does not belong in the otherwise excellent product line the kettle s shape makes it very difficult to pour the handle conveys all of the heat of the boiling water so you are not able to touch the handle without a hot pad i have given up using the whistle attachment for two reasons first it is not made of cuisinart s stainless steel \( it appears to be made of plastic with a silver plastic coating \) and so it has cracked and peeled from the heat and second it is impossible to remove the whistle when the kettle is hot so you are unable to pour your boiling water \( often all that comes off when attempting to remove the whistle is the decorative ball on its tip \) i really wish that i had returned this tea kettle	negative
here i have a refurbished palinato x3 textured very hardy stainless and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws 170 to start \( 6 mo warranty \) but let me correct one point made in these reviews the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic a rather new trend that works quite well the steam nob as well seems to be this material all around this is quite an improvement on the x1 more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x1 cups warm quicker also it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better still it s important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming fat content just makes more fat not true foamed milk	positive

the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter but traveling i would use the batteries don t make this mistake	negative

when trying to decide if this model \( 3670g \) was the right vacuum for me i found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it s features on the internet and from the manufacturer itself first of all many online retailers flat out state \( inaccurately \) that this model has a hepa \( high efficiency particulate air \) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on amazon \( at least as of this writing \) seems to indicate that it has one as well i can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does not have a hepa filter more on that a little later in this review however i found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number \( i e 3670g \) be careful to understand the difference between what amazon calls the 3670 \( also called the 3670a in some places \) and the 3670 g models they look identical and appear to be identical \( both are yellow and black \) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670g has the larger 12 amp motor amazon carries both models and i almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum for only about a 5 10 difference in total price i m not sure why the smaller version is even offered it only seems to confuse the matter the 3670 also does not have the hepa filter incidentally i found the 3670g to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase it is compact very powerful and great for my needs the noise while high is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans the generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful not having one is a reasonable trade off in keeping the price down the blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides \( by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing \) the 3670g does require bags it is not a bagless model however and while some may prefer a bagless model i preferred a model that used bags the bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what i consider to be the additional convenience \( of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag \) the only reason i gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because i did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate three attachment tools are included a crevice tool a 10 floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly shaped brush \( about 2 wide \) on the end the combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick up \( 3 wide \) in my opinion this cleaner badly needs a mid sized brush and or pick up tool that is about 4 5 wide the 2 wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2 wide i found that i simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces \( such as a wall for example \) in order to cover the area needed i would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4 5 wide had been included as it is i am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra finally a comment about the hepa filter some people \( particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air \) may want cleaners that include this item in my case i did not want this since i don t need it and hepa filters can be quite expensive to change and replace \( unless you get a washable one also expensive \) since many online descriptions i found were unclear whether the 3670g included this filter \( some descriptions flatly stated that it does \) i found myself calling the eureka customer service number to find out for sure it turned out that even eureka s own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn t have one if you do want the hepa filter you would want the 3684d which looks the same but is red in color slightly more expensive and has more and better quality attachments as well as the hepa filter by the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment \( which i mentioned earlier that i think is needed on the 3670g \) you are at the price of a 3684d in that case the 3684d may well be a better value for you particularly if you like the hepa filter overall i think the boss series of canister vacuums is a great product eureka \( and amazon as well \) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however	positive

this pan is a good buy and a wonderful size for 2 3 member families although not as heavy as some of the french copper pans i have many of the commercial calphalon pieces and love the handle the pan is definately heavier than cheap quality pans and the stainless interior is just what i wanted for acidic based cooking \( tomato sauces etc \) as far as scratches well what do you expect if you use it it is going to get some scratches the brushed exterior helps hide some of the outside marks though some have complained about scratches on the other calphalon hard anodized but most of the time they really aren t scratches but rather aluminum marks from the rivets when stacking in any case they are easily removed with scotchbrite and some cleaner enjoy p s i chose the no shipping cost delivery and received the pan in just 4 days	positive

first off this is available at the ewins site for 30 should you decide to plunge the construction of the wooden parts is pretty nice better than what you d expect for 50 but that s about the only positive thing the hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you need so you re kind of sol when the crappy aluminum cams break i m sure they d send some more if i asked but for now my piece is hanging out half way assembled because i m scared of breaking any more of the hardware either way i think i m going to ditch the cam bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up the instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web if you ve never built flat pack furniture before you will not be able to figure it out even if you have you will put something together incorrectly and have to disassemble the piece	negative

i have been looking for a good cheese plane and this one isn t it it works fine for rubbery semi soft cheeses like swiss but not for harder cheese like cheddar which tend to crrumble before i can finish a slice the problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid it should be thin and flexible also don t let the name fool you this utensil is made in china a country which consumes very little cheese	negative
i just got this thing 2 hours ago in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working made it through about 8oz try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot nope number one this is nothing more than a typical small hand held grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing do not buy this the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing	negative

if i could give half a star i would i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day i used it less than 3 times a week there are several drawbacks to this unit it draws alot of electricity to run it i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on water gurgles spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned the spout is also poorly designed the water doesn t come out in an even stream it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago it is everything this kettle isn t and so much more read the reviews on that one before you buy this one its a better choice all around save the shipping costs time headache just buy the braun first and pass this one up	negative

i live in sw florida everything down here rusts even the nails in the walls i am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives amazon has a deal i couldn t refuse 90 steak knives for only 29 99 i bought two sets and i couldn t be happier it will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight after using big clunky steakhouse style wooden handle knives for so many years my husband might not be as enthusiastic as i am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well i will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp but i don t keep my knives in boxes no storage room i have a lot of stainless steel german knives and i consider them to be the best i have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there handy and nice looking these will complete my collection of nice looking knives on that wall handy where i can just reach up and grab them you just can t beat the price but if you don t like them you can return them amazon is the best place i have found to buy everything i need for my kitchen bar none i will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures	positive

luigi bormioli has proven to me that they possess the exceptional quality of service that i would like to be able to expect from all vendors when my product arrived broken from shipment amazone com would not replace it due to the fact that it was past their deadline i contacted the luigi bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses when they arrived however they were the wrong glasses i returned them to the company along with the broken glasses i had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again i would highly recommend these glasses and this company	positive

i bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor s mutt the offending dog is often left on the neighbor s porch where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by before ordering i had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect in my case the neighbor s porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine unfortunately this was not too close for comfort as far as the dog was concerned having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices i was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working alas it did not some dogs just don t hear them in my case it was probably due at least in part to the distance my suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20 of the target if it doesn t work go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund \( which is exactly what i did \) by the way you don t need an ra \( aka rma \) number to return the device just send it to the company along with your receipt and a note saying that you would like a refund \( not an exchange \) \( \) i sympathize with anyone having this problem and wish you all the best of luck no one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason and the argument that dogs bark simply does not hold any water	negative
i am very pleased with this product the atelier wash is soft absorbent and looks good after laundry i have always found the martex brand to be top quality	positive
we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand that after 2 years was no longer bouncing back into shape this serta topper is just fine as comfortable as our last one my big complaint is that someone at serta \( though serta isn t the actual manufacturer \) needs to measure a queen sized bed because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides if you place the topper in the included protective cover it s several inches short on all 4 sides i know 1 inch sounds minor but if you re a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed the topper doesn t protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress as far as toppers in general we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed you don t feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper \( though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more \) definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford and the thickest you can afford	positive
i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser when it arrived the teapot was broken with a large section missing from the side i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price after receiving my second teapot it was cracked in the exact same spot i returned the product and complained with no response i was refunded the price for the teapot but i am out 10 in the cost of shipping it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot so i would try a different product	negative

the price seemed great and i really liked the modern look when i took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked assembly was very easy it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes \( the most \) the design is really great it s very compact perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better great idea poorly executed would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product my main concern is that the construction seems like it wouldn t last too long i feel like i should attach sit carefully tag to it before anybody comes over	negative
i bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker i could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it rather than 2 however i used it exactly 5 days and then it died granted the econonical price was a factor when i purchased it but i really expected it to last more than 5 days unfortunately it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed so i was forced to throw it away lesson learned some things are just not a bargain	negative
the spice rack looks nice won t know the quality until i can use it and see how much weight it will take i had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet it is definitely a 2 person job and there was only me the self adhesive tabs didn t work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws very awkward to use the screws doesn t allow for any room especially the back screws i did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible i wouldn t have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet took much too much time to get it into place	negative
i have four 16 piece sets that i received for my wedding they are beautiful plates but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use like heating food up in the microwave going through the dishwasher or serving hot food within 3 months several plates cracked down the middle making them unusable a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added i did a search on www epinions com and found i wasn t the only person having these problems everyone is having these problems plus it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces you have to buy another set what a racket the clincher is that they are located in indonesia so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent i ve gotten nothing but the international run around	negative

i used this pan just this morning and i really like it it has a great non stick surface and is easy to clean the price is great also the only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle it slants downward instead of upward so if you have a flat surface stovetop your pan won t sit flat on the surface i have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me i didn t notice this from the picture and the descriptions don t mention this but i think it is important to know who knows maybe i got a defective pan and don t know it other than that it is a great pan for the money i like it more than other non stick pans i have had	positive
the product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area which came out with laundering other than that the sheets are great the lace needs starch and ironing the fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses these two beds are put together to make a king bed this product was a christmas gift and it was well received	positive

i got excited about 5min after opening the box most people laugh at the idea but this thing is perfect for me i live in a decent sized apartment and always have unexpected guests all i did was set the schedule to to the thing on twice a week while at work lets see how that runs just for fun as soon as i got it i plugged thehomebase charger in took the roomba to the opposite end of my apartment in another room pushed the find home buttons and within 5 min it was charging it self right now i have it running around the apt just to watch it its entertaining circling around chair legs before its done going under furniture stopping at lint and going over it again it till it gets picked up i dont know what to say ive had the thing for 5 hours and im loving it whenever it goes over wires it backs up and tries something else and the thing sounds like a remote control car maybe not even that loud i was expecting it to sound like a full blown vacumm not the case at all just as a test i put a very thin cord about 6 inches long in its path to see what would happen the thing tries everything to get it from being stuck then if it cant get it out it stops and makes little game over type sound effects this thing is good anyone who sees what its doing to my apt will wind up getting it i will update this if anything changes hope you get the same results	positive

i own the graphite style of this set i was originally very happy with the purchase the set looked great didn t chip easily and was a great size after a year of use i ve come up with a list of problems the clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed the semi matte finish acquires a powdery almost bleached look to it after many washings \( says dishwasher safe guess that means the colors don t wash away immediately \) my biggest complaint we bought these because they were microwave safe i don t know what microwave safe means to most people but it means to me that i could put a plate bowl or cup in the microwave heat up the contents and then safely remove the object and use it in the case of the set i purchased it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode unfortunately in the case of the sango graphite set it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the \( plate bowl cup \) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the \( plate bowl cup \) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave they get very hot \( cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120f while cup surface is 170f \) i ve only broken 2 items from the set both times i dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned \( first time i thought it was a fluke second time i learned my lesson \) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave i emailed sango several times and received no response at all while i liked the set a lot initially i have been very disappointed over time with its quality i will never purchase another from sango again	negative
this product is very well constructed it is simple to use and easy to clean i use it to cook brown rice and dry beans and it has cut my cooking time down immeasurably i have only had it a few months so far and i have not been able to perfect the rice \( there always seems to be too much water left at the end \) but i will keep reducing the amount of water until i have the perfect mix i would highly recommend this pressure cooker to anyone beginning cooks or seasoned culinary experts i ll certainly be sending one down to south carolina for mothers day	positive

i bought this for my mother a year ago and i was recently looking for a vacuum myself so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing i asked her how she liked it she said she liked it and thought it worked well and loved how light it was \( she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis \) so needless to say i went out and purchased it trusting mother deartest s opinion i hate it i just moved out of my house and i had to clean \( vacuum \) every room in the house it took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy hoover vacuum to do the job one sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s just to pick up some damn crumbs also you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily after only vacuuming about half a room it will not suck up hair rather it gets tangled in the wheel and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never ever cleaned out hence making it harder and harder to pick things up \( not that it does to begin with \) it s loud time consuming and the biggest waste of money the only thing it has going for it is its weight which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway oh and i ve used this product once once one time of use pretty much was all it was worth if that i m taking it back and throwing it at them don t waste your money on this people	negative
i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still haven t received this i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now won t get it until june 30th costumer service is ridiculous i was told it would take 3 5 days that s why i ordered it don t get it if you need it within one yea	negative

saw these canisters and fell in love with them couldn t wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn t fit properly another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off i was disppointed in the quality i wouldn t buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive	negative
i personally haven t heard a peep about silverstone in ages and frankly when i bought this item i didn t even realize it was made by them i needed new muffin pans so i just looked for the best deal price wise i saw this set and figured it was as good as any when i received them i was ecstatic when you think of something relatively trivial like this you don t really expect much in the way of quality but man was i wrong these things are weighty very well constructed and have durable written all over them i consider it a huge upgrade from my old flimsy no name tins and i highly recommend them for anyone who like me bakes a lot and really just doesn t want to worry about replacing these kinds of things too often	positive
this is the most loathesome appliance i have ever owned i hate everything about it some genius put the power cord at the bottom of the unit so you have to hold the cord up all the time to keep from backing over it this may not be such a problem if the stupid self propelled function weren t constantly trying to shoot backward meaning i need both hands just to push the unit forward it s like i m dancing with my vacuum and we re fighting for the lead ridiculous i have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house and i wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster oh it also came with a free little red dd sweeper the handle of which broke the first time i tried to use it i don t know if dd came under new management or what but i will never buy one of their products again	negative
finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction i have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived the suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned the hepa filter means you really can t smell that you ve been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change also who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner hey if you have to own one wouldn t you prefer to have one that s easy on the eye	positive
this unit is smaller than i was expecting it is 11 tall and 5 5 in diameter i have it in our small bathroom at the moment because it was too small to affect the humidity level in the 120 square foot room i had originally put it in \( i have a hygrometer in the room to measure its humidity and this unit did not affect the humidity level in 24 hours \) i doubt it is adequate for our tiny bathroom it seems like it might be adequate for a not too humid closet it says it removes 16oz a day at 86 degrees fahrenheit but whose house it 86 degrees in our humid bathroom it sucks up a mere third of an inch a day i guess it performs better in a warmer space	negative
we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky our daughter now has it and is happy with it we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump it s a little too fast for what i want most of the time another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter	positive
about a month ago a friend gave me her gf tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen in return i grilled up some home made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper i really love this grill even though it s got a big surface area it s no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away and it cleans really easily my tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm the charred stuff wipes right off i wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles like the smaller g5 version does just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby i do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage though given its size bottom line i d highly recommend this grill especially if you re using it for a family of four or more	positive

it s weird the handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome emeril logo then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it s shape easily you d hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle but not here it s not a bad whisk for the price but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars buy something else	negative

just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place paid 6 50 for item and 6 34 for shipping and was very displeased upset with quality of the item i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft	negative

this is our first juicer and we are have a great time juicing everything we use it a lot with our smoothie maker it is designed well and is very easy to clean it does drip a bit for a while from the spout but that isn t a problem at all we got this because we have a 2 year old and a 16 year old we wanted to make it easy to give them great tasting sweets that are good for them my 16 year old son loves apple juice and makes it all the time now no more soda in our house	positive
i bought this blender based on the reviews here as well as its great looking design when i got the blender only one of those factors came through first thing i noticed both blender jars leaked badly after reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible the leak was slightly reduced the metal jar still poured out liquids from the base second thing i noticed this blender cannot make a good smoothie even after a couple minutes of blending there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades \( regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie \) for a blender of any price the delonghi does a poor job making smoothies for a blender that costs what the delonghi does this performance is totally unjustifiable but hey it does look really good	negative
this is the best most beloved item in my kitchen i only wish i had bought the grinder and all the different cups \( which i am going to now add on \) i read some of the other reviews and at first i was also disappointed with this blender now that i have learned how to use it i love it do not put protein powder into it first it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup which you invert onto the blades \( when you invert it the bottom becomes the top \) if you put liquid in first and then the powder there s no problem you have to learn how to use it you will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick i read the reviews here before i bought mine and a woman said hers was junk but i went ahead and read the rest of the reviews and decided to buy it if mine breaks in a year it will have been well worth the price i use it every day and sometimes three times a day on a hot day when i want something slushy and cold i ll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice in a flash you have a refreshing drink it s fabulous i could use my cuisinart but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison there are no buttons to push you just fill the cup with your juice \( i often add protein powder \) and something frozen \( ice or frozen fruit \) and screw on the lid \( which have blades in it \) and put it on the blending base and twist you can either twist and pusle it or twist and leave it to blend on its own then you take the lid off rinse and that s it i love hummus and i will never make it in the blender because you have to dig it out and most of it gets left behind with this gadget you fill the cup blend it then screw off the blade lid screw on the refrigerator lid and that s it nothing to scrape just put it in the refrigerator \( oh yes you do have to rinse off the blade lid that s the whole clean up \) if you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend this is a great gadget i live in two places and i am getting another one for the other place but i m buying the complete set this time	positive
i read the reviews before i purchased this machine i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of so with this in mind i will put in my 2 cents i have had my machine for two months and i use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults a 4 year old and two dogs generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease the machine is set up to auto shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean freaks this machine doesn t quite hit the mark the water cleaning solution section is in my humble opinion to small i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up \) one more comment before i give my final review remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends there s a reason for this if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets so my final opinion is this if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it s a great time saver it s a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac up of dog hair scrub and mop any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment mop and bucket routine if you are a cleanfreak like me you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand and knees scrub no machine will ever leave you satisfied this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it s great i am giving this machine 4 stars because i think it does what it was designed to do light cleaning i would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i ll be all over it until then i ll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month	positive
when i ordered this product it had a 4 star average rating how that happened is beyond me were a zero star rating available this product wouldn t even deserve the string of uncolored stars i purchased it thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic freebie grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago after many refills that all plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the gears the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper so i order this one it s attractive low mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out and guess what i m still using the plastic worn out grinder this miu grinder was a total waste of money and i just can t bear to listen to it squeal when i attempt to use it its adjustement is loose enough that s not the problem what good s a lifetime warranty against wearing out if i m not going to use the grinder at all now i m stuck with it unless i want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order so basically i may could get a few bucks back which is probably what i ll do because this grinder isn t worth 2 cents i wouldn t even give the thing away maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person i ll certainly not purchase another one online if you like the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard buy this grinder buy a second one for your salt while you re at it you ll love em \( update 1 month later i tried to give this thing a chance and the god awful squealing is becoming less consistent which might be even worse as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high pitched jag every so often it s gotten quite worse however with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn from fine grind to quarter corn sized pieces in a few turns not recommended at all i might try switching it over to salt maybe it can handle that better	negative
i bought these because i was sick of creating foil shields on the pies i bake i love that these slip perfectly on and off however i ve found that since they re made of metal or aluminum they actually conduct heat and cause the crust of the pie to darken faster than the center which is exactly what i didn t want it to do that said i have to admit that while the edges of my pies look darker than the rest it hasn t come out burnt as it would if i were to bake the pie without any sort of shield i m planning on buying another brand s something made from silicone instead	negative

i purchased this toy for a friend s dog a while back the dog loved it he played with it non stop \( quack quack \) when he finally destroyed it though we were shocked inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag my friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items we did complain to the manufacturer who said they d look into it but i would still be wary of this toy i think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it s toys but doesn t rip them to shreds there is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe	negative

i received this popper as a gift and while it looks nice it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn nothing worked if i had the receipt it would already have been returned since i don t it is going in the garbage also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine stay away from this machine	negative

this wok is heavy and unbalanced it can tip while on the element the long handle is thick and uncomfortable and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task the flat bottom isn t wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir frying if i wanted to saut i d have gotten a saut pan the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere you need lots of counter space as well this wok just isn t large enough for stir frying for more than two people	negative
i m a betta hobbist and i know about all the misconceptions that betta can live in just about anything and it is bogus this aquarium is way too small betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1 2x weekly atleast this is probably 1 2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills this also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just isn t good you can also buy large critter carriers \( 2 3 gallons \) for the same price or less it wouldn t be great but it d be a heck of a lot better	negative
the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove	negative

bought this vacuum because consumer reports picked it as one of the 2006 best buys better than dyson or rainbow this is our second eureka but this one is significantly better than the last the last was a bagless model and this one uses bags and as a result it s much easier to clean bags are quite inexpensive so it only adds about 10 15 per year \( 6 9 bags \) suction is fantastic noise is low it s easy to use and i will add that we purchased a refurbished model but we can identify no defects or differences looks perfectly new and runs great so the choice is yours dyson for 400 or this one which is better for 99	positive
this is a high quality pan with a nice heavy weight to it not at all flimsy i wanted to get one like my mom s and this turned out to be less expensive but a much better quality and heavier weight i bought 2 of these along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon s 4 for 3 promotion and it only came to about 30 that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality i would absolutely recommend these	positive

we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out when i saw the refurbished for 20 00 i thought it was a great deal it would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn t leak it didn t come with seals or with the water purifier i tried everything including new seals \( that i bought separately \) eventually we just went out and purchased a new one because we still like the model	negative

my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it	negative
this canister vac might be ok for very light duty but don t expect it to handle any real housecleaning the filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot if i had it to do over again i would not purchase this vac i would save up and buy a better canister vacuum	negative

when i adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago two of my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter here s why this fresh step premium clay cat litter is excellent for your favorite kitty s litter box the company states that it is very good at absorbing odors and by golly it s true the odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat moreover i really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box that s a plus for any cat lover if you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend not surprisingly that you use more cat litter in the box otherwise if you have just one cat two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine you should change the entire litter box once a week on average \( i change mine about twice a week just for my cat s comfort \) it s also a good idea to scoop out any kitty remains every other day or so be very certain not to flush any kitty presents down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this i suppose it could clog toilet pipes moreover as you may suspect any kitty leftovers could have some nasty germs that we don t want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any kitty presents with a scooper the fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any kitty presents thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box nevertheless i recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage in short this is a great cat litter product at a great price the contents of the bag last a long time especially if like me you have only one cat the manufacturer also offers customers \( us not the cats \) an awards program with points that you can accumulate in your account with the company on the company internet website a nice plus ok fresh step i thank you my father and mother thank you and most importantly my cat says thank you smiles	positive
great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice you have to spray the pan really really well with cooking spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the cornbread to come out in one piece i run a little spatula around the edges before i dump the pan gave one as a gift at christmas and it was a hit	positive

i have had many different kinds of wine openers screwpull rabbits etc and nothing compares to the ease of this cork pop i have the legacy version nice looking and takes less than 10 seconds to remove the foil and open the bottle no kidding \( okay i haven t really timed it \) this would be great for someone with arthritic hands as there is no pulling or tugging involved not even to remove the cork from the opener just twist and the cork is removed it is really the most amazing opener ever the only downside i can think of is you will have to have cartridge refills eventually i received mine about a month ago and have opened about 15 bottles of wine and still have plenty of juice left in the cartridge awesome	positive

i bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great that is until it started leaking about 4 months after i bought it giving the benefit of the doubt and thinking the leak was a qa issue rather than a design issue i managed to exchange it for the exact same model well it s been 4 months since i got the new one and this morning what did i notice yup a leak the tank was full yesterday and this morning it s 2 3 s full with a pool of water on the table that holds it luckily no damage was done to the floor either time i understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time well then it s just a cruddy product stay away from this aquarium	negative

wow what a fine example of terrible engineering the only control is a knob that ranges from off to super to set the thermostat you turn the knob to the super setting when the room reaches a comfortable level you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off this is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp at this setting the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp this design sets the stage for a frustrating user experience by design you must turn the thermostat to the highest setting then wait for the room to heat up before fiddling with the knob until the unit clicks off at which point you end up turning it up a bit until it clicks on \( if it does \) its like trying to adjust your home s thermostat in the dark just show me where to set the dial for 68 degrees and let me get on with my day when the heater is working as designed it turns on for 30 60 seconds turns off for 10 90 seconds then repeats the cycle relentlessly and unpredictably until you unplug it let it cool box it back up and send it back i want a refund reimbursement for lost productivity and an ice cream sandwich	negative

it s pretty comfortable but what new mattress isn t the foam memory material takes a little getting used to i generally prefer a very firm mattress and had to get used to the sinking in feeling i ve also found you can t really use a lot of pillows what i like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns or gets out of bed you don t feel it the smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell but it isn t as obnoxious as it s made out to be but definitely present if ignored it will linger for about a month or so i didn t try to spray anything on it because it didn t really bother me that much over all it s a good mattress although not the greatest thing since sliced bread i m sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress and feel i ve definitely gotten my moneys worth i would recommend it	positive

i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it s also compact i gained a little more counter space	positive

we were very skeptical one of our cats would mark certain spots \( like corners \) occassionaly but we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room it got so bad that we had to discard the rug we tried boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day but the one time we forgot to spray he would mark again we were at our wits end and decided to try feliway we bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots at first we also used the boundary but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn t see any urine markings anymore it took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work our cat even appears more calm and pleasant we make sure that we replace the container of feliway every 5 weeks or so it s well worth the money	positive

we have had this unit for 6 months and we really enjoyed it it makes a great cup of coffee it is easy to use and we do not understand why some other reviews complain then without any warning it stopped working i called hamilton beach and they are sending a free replacement no questions asked the unit has a hassle free 3 year warranty and it really was a snap we are glad we bought this unit and are happy with how hamilton beach stands behind their products	positive

i like the fact that it included diff sized containers and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot i have read reviews where people have burned out their motors and i will have to say that yes it s possible but only if you didn t follow the directions the manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient expect to shake things up once in a while between blends and this unit should last you at least a year d i think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it s thang gee if that was the case i d let my car drive me on auto pilot	positive
i purchased this fry pan in june of this year and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all clad but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer and a small fraction of the cost after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food ick i love the uncoated all clad but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future	negative

i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more francis francis being my first this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as espresso machines but marginally if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important focusing on the machine for a moment you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed	negative

these cups are high quality stainless steel don t worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink i was surprised by their weight and long handles my old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups these miu cups are extremely sturdy the handles on my old cups were more typical too while these miu cups all have very long handles \( 4 5 \) at first i didn t like the asthestics of the handles nor the fact that the smaller ones don t stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates however when i needed to scoop something out of a small mouthed container i quickly reversed my opinion of these handles cricisms the interior has perpendicular corners i prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying still it doesn t make much of a difference also while they re not hard to store they don t stack all that well so they ll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers \( 5 5 \) i suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease \( \) for the 5 cups i m extremely satisfied i feel these are top of the line the 7 cup set is overpriced \( \) so definitely go with these i don t understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2 3 and 3 4 cups just use the 1 3 cup twice or the 1 4 three times or eyeball the 1 cup \(	positive
i was looking for a timer that had a loud ringer i could hear from another room while cleaning so i could check on what i m cooking this one just didn t do that for me i notice the sound it sends out is not always the same sometimes it is a bit louder then other times to me that does not do me much good i cannot depent on it all the time so now i just use it to keep near me when i m at the computer but i do notice more of the sound comes out of the back but then you can t see how much time you have left if you turn it backwards the ringer goes for 1 min this does not count backward the numbers and buttons are large which is probably the reason i bought this timer the two magnets are not very big and does not stay on my frig very good when its on my frig and i start to press the buttons it starts moving all over price wise this is probably a good buy depending on what you want to use it for i bought another timer that the ringer is louder but the buttons and are very small guess you cannot have it all no matter at what the price is	negative

unless you re planning on washing dinner plates only this dish rack is not for you smaller plates \( or bowls for that matter \) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips \( about 1 8 inch \) so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open \( 3 1 4 inches \) anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor the utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom i bought this thinking that since polder has a good name it would be a good product i was wrong and polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design	negative

we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model	negative
we already owned the 7 inch santoku knife purchased locally from a kitchen retailer and loved it we were a little hesitant at first since we ve only ever had cheaper knives but as soon as we felt it in our hands and tried the knife we were sold still the 7 inch is a little big for small jobs so we decided to get this 4 inch paring knife i coupled a gift certificate with an amazon com kitchen coupon promotion and was able to get the 4 inch paring knife and the 8 inch bread knife for a very good price this should pretty much complete our knife set from my experience these three knives are versatile enough for almost any job the 4 inch paring knife specifically is great for smaller jobs where the santoku would be awkward it s balanced perfectly stays sharp and since it s a single piece it cleans easily and you don t have to worry about the handle breaking all in all great knife and highly recommended	positive

this waterer is a great concept but does have some drawbacks for starters one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it the other dog is just fine with it but then again he s deaf so the gurgle doesn t bother him lol the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls it gets dirty so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl but it s a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off clean the bowl and but the jug back on so if your dog isn t afraid of the noise it makes and you don t mind the extra hassle cleaning it it s great otherwise just get a large bowl that s what i ended up having to do	negative

we love these glasses we have had the reidel glasses like these many times they break so easily and can t go in the dishwasher these glasses are so much more utilitarian we use them as our everyday glasses not just for wine they look great feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher and cost so much less we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions they are more refined but i got so tired of that ultra thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass i strongly recommend the libbey glasses you will like it like like it on your table table table	positive

since i have been pleased with my t fal pressure cooker i purchased this pan based on the quality of craftsmanship i like this pan for frying its stainless steel with the thick aluminum heat diffuser bottom makes it robust \( it is warp free \) other aluminum pans tend to warp over time the nonstick surface seems to be less prone to scratches however i always recommend non metallic utensils for piece of mind the center heat indicator is helpful to know when it s ready	positive

i bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box first the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back there was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance finally it is just not good looking at all extremely cheap in appearance it did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to amazon i went with the bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers evidently another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances do not buy this item get the braun kf550 bk aromadeluxe instead	negative

okay i bought for the price and it is effective enough but it is very clumsy and unergonomic so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer the main problems are balance of weight and the switch first the switch because it is a cheap push in button which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on you lose optimum control quickly the handle is badly placed for this as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it but you can t hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting in addition keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife but because the button sinks deep into the handle so your thumb is inside the handle as you re trying to hold and control the knife quick cramp moreover as you re pushing it in if the food you re cutting is moist \( like a turkey \) juices may run onto the handle your thumb and into the hole into which you re pressing the button not safe a couple times i ve wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock either way it wasn t good then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good look at the huge bulk of the motor and then look at where the handle is located and how it is designed there s no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is add in the need to be depressing the power button as you re holding it awkwardly and 2 stars for effectiveness minus 3 for bad functional design	negative
i bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before christmas 2006 it seemed like a perfect if unnecessary stocking stuffer for my wife since we re both wine enthusiasts i never really felt these gimmick aerators did much that a solid 1 2 hour decanting couldn t do boy was i wrong the device itself is attractive compact and solidly built it appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass funnel with a rubber grip there are two small channels in the center of the funnel which look like cracks in the plastic \( i ve read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable \) wine is poured through the top of the funnel and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel the aerator is easily held and i ve never had a problem with spills now on to the effect of the vinturi i ve been using the vinturi for 5 months now on a variety of wines from a bottle of two buck chuck to a nice 98 vietti barolo to a bottle of 97 phelps insignia in every circumstance with every wine i ve noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the vinturi as opposed to tasted directly from bottle the flavours are more blended the finish is less acidic and frankly it has made most of the wines i drink a more pleasurable experience from sniff to swallow i ve conducted several blind tastings with friends and we all agree this thing works if you re a serious wine drinker or shopping for a wine drinker in your life give this product a try at 40 it s about the price of a decent california cabernet and will yield results for decades to come i plan on picking up a few dozen this christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients	positive

i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel let s be realistic these knives are cheap they re thin and they re not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that s what you re getting i hand washed these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and didn t hear back i finally got their address \( from the post office \) and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them \( with 15 minute wait times for each call \) to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i m going to finish my sentence so their rep would stop talking they won t refund my money in fact they won t refund anyone s money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they ll send me another set of soon to be rusty knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can	negative

these refills are ridiculous yes they are simple to use but the maximum life span is about two weeks i ve gone through at least 6 sets of refills this winter season already and the results are consistent i run the vornado humidifier 24 7 as recommended by the manufacturer and clean it regularly especially when changing out the wicks there is never any gunky build up to blame the short life span on these are clearly manufactured to last only two weeks my ancient duracraft which is no longer manufactured but is the best humidifier i ve ever had easily goes 4 to 6 weeks between wick filter changes with no deterioration in performance this will be the last year i use the vornado for next year i ll be purchasing a second air o swiss which runs like a dream but is quite pricey up front	negative
i m terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute doesn t hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself	negative

unlike many people it seems i ve never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker it s still sturdy for me after about 8 uses however the fact that i ve owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself this waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles i ve never been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles i ve had in restaurants after trying over half a dozen different recipes i realized that it wasn t my ingredients it was the waffle maker this waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be crispy on the outside chewy and moist on the outside instead no matter what recipe i used or how long i cooked the waffles for i would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness \( if they had any to begin with \) within moments of leaving the waffle maker the model doesn t burn the waffles the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking and overall the waffle maker is nice looking but that s all it has going for it i ve learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances you get what you pay for	negative
this is an excellent product if you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium and making huge messes walking in puddles etc and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks this product is for you don t waste your money on cheap suction devices and buy the python today \( sorry if i sound like an infomercial i m just an enthusiastic user \) the python attaches to your faucet you turn the water on full blast stick the suction tube end into your tank and you can drain your tank in minutes or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes then you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up \( again in minutes \) i have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank and what used to take me a whole day now takes about an hour \( to do all tanks \) i like that i can vacuum the gravel boy does this thing suck the waste up this will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great i was skeptical that this product would work but am so glad that i bought it now i actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it the directions are easy to follow even for people like me who are direction impaired	positive

after about 10 days from date of purchase only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle i would have to push the on button get another 2 cups after 5 or 6 tries i would finally get all 8 cups through the design is bad for left handed people it s very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate the lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and i would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid overall not a good design i got my money back and am bought a hamilton beach brewstation which i think is a great coffemaker	negative

this was a lot of fun its big and different from my golden s other toys and it makes a really unusual sound not a squeak but a honk if you will the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog s short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan	positive
this is an incredibly beautiful knife with an excellent weight well balanced the damascus steel is just so nice my husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative this is our third expensive kitchen knife and i would say that in terms of general use meat to vegetables this is my second favorite with my large 8 henckel being my best knife the shun is much nicer than the wusthof prix ii which sports the comparable santoku shape my complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle making this a much better knife for filleting motions of which i do few it s marketed toward general chopping and slicing but i find that slant makes my cuts less precise it s still my husband s favorite but since i m the one who does the majority of the cooking i d still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands but it s a real marvel to behold and i love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel	positive

unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time with normal bread in before lowering the bread sticks almost 1 2 way out of the toaster making it very easy to remove hot toast to toast smaller items \( the plunger will go up even further to assist \) the slots are extra wide so although i have not used the sandwich cage accessory i can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage \( apparently a british idea and maybe something worth investigating \) i am doing normal toast on only setting 2 bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect \( bagel feature push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right \) the machine feels solid as if it will last a long time the cobalt blue color is more of a bluish purple in normal light but very attractive very happy with the machine \( the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping	positive
i was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for xmas however if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs i won t be using it often the literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre seasoned and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat on the first try i had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots though i was able to get it to release with a pancake turner the scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off even with soaking for awhile on the second try i oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread so as to not have any bare spots i still had sticking ditto for clean up this thing weighs a ton too it is awkward to transfer off the burner the instructions warn lift do not slide on a glass top stove i think i ll continue to use my non stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press that always works great	negative

moved into a new home wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets decided to try a bagless model this thing is a total waste of money it has barely any suction whatsoever especially when trying to use the hose so for now after running this thing i have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just couldn t suck up it s ridiculous it s a brand new vacuum i have never had to do this with any other vacuum i had my husband make sure it was working right and it is it just has a very weak suction this thing is going back to the store and i am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum don t waste your money also i have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors \( well they all pretty much do that job but for some reason this has a bare floor setting whoop de do \) it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor nor can it suck up a cobweb don t buy	negative

i bought this toaster after reading several reviews finding a reasonable price and liking the look of it i was looking to upgrade since my old toaster \( a toastmaster \) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown i am seriously disappointed with this toaster i put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts and that half usually ends up burnt the slots are slanted forward and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster it is the upper portion that over toasts and the lower portion comes out essentially raw though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so and had to go through two cycles it still toasted better then this t fal i bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times i am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand hope this helps	negative

this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen it s the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons you ll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant good stones are expensive though i think it s worth it for such a fine knife	positive

when i first saw this dehumidifier i couldn t stop laughing this little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed i figured that something was better than nothing until i could buy a better \( bigger \) dehumidifier i hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little bitty sucked up an inch of water in one night now i am so confident that this will do the job i will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem the free shipping was a great plus as well	positive
i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine s day party it was the talk of the whole school the kids loved it i used sephra chocolate \( a coupon was included \) so i didn t have to mess with adding any oil the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression the cascading flowing chocolate wasn t quite as perfect as the pictures on the box but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine i also saved 25 00 by buying the chp \( champaigne color \) version	positive

the pots and pans were delivered very quickly to my residence the items were well packaged since we just moved into our apartment we began using them the pots and pans had sturdy construction and was relatively easy to clean the only drawback would be the lid handles those became very hot to the touch and you would need a hand towel or an oven mitt to handle it \( on a side note the lid handles are clear glass so that is definitely a plus \) overall i am quite satisfied with the purchase they were under 100 00 for the set so we are happy with it although i did not hear of the pinzon brand before i was surprised with the quality i even purchased a oven roaster w rack from pinzon as well	positive

i am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs amazon s listing says this innotek trainer comes with a lifetime warranty i ve read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars so i decided to review the owner s manual to learn more about the warranty the last page has a section entitled lifetime limited warranty which states innotek brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase the lifetime warranty apparently expires after one year further on it says the company offers several product exchange options during the warranty period costs are dependent on the processing time this suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year lifetime warranty the next paragraph says after one year from date of original retail purchase we will repair replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate based on the component what will these repairs cost this leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from innotek what if anything is warranted for a lifetime if the lifetime warranty is really only for one year why call it lifetime and finally what will repairs cost both during warranty under their product exchange options and afterwards under their component based fixed rate my specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery the manual does not indicate that this battery is user replaceable does this mean the user will have to send the collar to innotek to replace the battery and if so what will it cost i have contacted innotek through their website and will report back if i get a response until i do i ve got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty can anyone comment on warranty claims to innotek	negative
i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker but when it arrived it was just like brand new including all original packing perfect i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately but again it was quite strong in this regard and froze the mixtures perfectly admittedly doesn t make a huge amount but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it and it s way quieter than the old fashioned freezers also it was half the price of a new one buy it	positive

this knife is great for hard cheeses i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily but if you only use it for cheese it should stay sharp for a long time this is another beautiful global knife	positive
my kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40 my wife and i limit their exposure when we can an example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye recently they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle we figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers the ability to make jerky was a bonus for me i ordered another brand that i thought was going to do the job but once it arrived i found the construction to be subpar and it was passive requiring rotation of the trays i immediately sent it back to amazon thats when i ordered this nesco unit it is powerful and effective i have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers i have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them order this and you can t go wrong	positive

i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo they appeared to be very sharp however i did not like these knives for the following reasons 1 \) i dont care much for the cheap plastic like orange handles 2 \) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap furi implies that these knives are made in germany however they are cheaply made in china now generally i dont care that much everything is now made in china anyways but when i am paying so much money for a product i was hoping it was made in germany or usa 3 \) the case is even more cheaply made personally i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives	negative
i was very hesitant to spend close to 160 on a single fry pan but i had heard so many good things about all clad and thought it would be a wise investment for the first 6 months the pan was great i loved the large size and used it often i was just about ready to invest in an entire set of all clad cookware when my pan warped i was using it on an electric stove as usual and the pan just simply warped i was thoroughly disappointed that a 160 pan would warp during normal use i won t be spending this kind of money again follow up i contacted all clad regarding the warped pan they had me send it in for evaluation and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door i m impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product	negative
the concept here is good no tools needed to install the product itself is well made but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down	negative
unfortunately there is no option for 0 star i had the same problem as lana from nc i ordered the product and when i opened the box i found that i received only the bottom piece when i asked if the remaining pieces could be shipped i was told that partial products are not shipped and that i would have to get an entirely new order fine other than i have to go through the hassle of waiting in line at the post office to return the wrong one except if they don t ship partial products then why did i receive a partial product to begin with i received the second mind you the replacement order and the same exact thing happened i received only the bottom piece so now i have to shlep both packages to the post office and waste my time for their error i suggest doing a search of metrokane cocktail shaker and you will find a couple other sites selling the same product one site even has 2 different sizes if anyone is looking for a smaller shaker	negative

this is the most amazing knife i have ever owned i ve purchased henckles twinstars sabatier which is pure junk out of all the knives ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives i enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives i have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all global this is quite a bold move as i consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where i must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know i do not want to live without i simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and henckles twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a pandora s box of spending it actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other i must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the excaliber of knives	positive
this delonghi bar32 espresso maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that i can find that does not have aluminum its water coffee path the boiler porta filter baskets brew group and steam wand are all stainless steel \( albeit the wand has a plastic tip \) i thought the capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta filter itself is made of aluminum \( although it does have stainless basket inserts \) and is twice the price than the delonghi bar32 it is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta filter after exiting the stainless baskets although capresso implies no in their ads	positive

at first i thought this was a great product if you only make cheese fondue it is great the pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe the problem i ve had with mine is that it doesn t get beyond about 320 degrees the dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up it only got up to 323 degrees and wouldn t go any further so if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it won t do the job well i know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break away cord but this is ridiculous touch the darn thing and the cord falls free very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue people kept telling me that the cheese was getting hard because the cord had fallen off again next time i d get a pot that had a thermometer built in don t rely on the heat setting dial	negative

within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off this is not the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect this is my third \( and final \) bread machine the first two were breadman ultimates i should note that i make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average pretty much every morning the first breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail this was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time \( water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond \) i bought an new breadman ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems this time i took extremely good care of the pan \( letting it cool down no soaking \) because it s clearly the weak link in the system within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed making the machine useless currently it doesn t seem very easy \( or even possible \) to buy a replacement pan for the breadman at this point i was done with the breadman much as i didn t want to spring for the extra money for the zojirushi and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn t work the same in the new machine i didn t see an alternative and got one within 3 weeks the teflon in the zoji pan formed two blisters one is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact i have been extremely careful with the pan i wait for it to cool and then remove the baked on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers i don t let it soak at all this is clearly a manufacturing defect i have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the breadman ultimate 1 \) the top of the bread rarely gets brown i ve added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much 2 \) i don t understand what the crust control option does it doesn t seem to increase baking time which it does on the breadman so it doesn t make much sense 3 \) the programmability is very weak on the breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs 4 \) the programmability options are very limited you can t control the knockdown time between risings you can t add risings to the default three they do give you a lot of time control on the risings you can t separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle it s all one cycle when you turn off the preheat cycle this only affects the built in programs and not the custom ones and worst of all you can t bake for more than 70 minutes this is utterly ridiculous i m sure this is a safety feature but it means you can t correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth this is almost a killer limitation in my opinion for those other reviewers that are having issues with rising i ve determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount type and quality of yeast if you exactly follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast it should work okay this means you must use rapid rise yeast with the quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs even using fleischmann s instead of red star made a difference the breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations at this point i m done with bread machines they are a failed technology in fact teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology all you have to do is search for teflon \( polytetrafluoroethylene \) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance the manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination a direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees \( eg frying pans \) perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread i ve thought about this but there s no way to make a bread machine without teflon going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon there is just no other viable solution i love making bread every day and i m going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean i have to give up on this technology it s back to the occasional hand made loaf it s the only rational and healthy solution	negative

was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	negative

i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon it s a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i didn t quite understand at the time i bought it was that it s also just one big piece of fabric no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place kind of disappointing but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila a great looking couch appeared so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money	positive
the distribution of heat in this pan is super great for gravies and sauces i have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking stir frying can reduce fats and is usually a pretty healthy way to eat a wide variety of veggies and other delightful ingredients i even use it to pop brown rice or basmati rice ever tried hot puffed rice sometimes i eat it just like pop corn but often just for a different way of serving rice this pan is deep enough with or without the lid to keep it from popping out of the pan \( depending how much you start with \) it is also useful to cook or finish foods in the oven up to 500 degrees and it is kitchenaid i expect it to outlast me	positive

this is essentially the all clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles the dutch oven sold by all clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1 2 quart saucier this is a versatile stovetop pan wide enough for frying deep enough for liquids good looking enough to carry to the table it can also slide into the oven when needed it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans as one poster complained but it functions quite well as an everyday pan for up to 4 persons the dimensions of 9 1 2 inches by 3 inches \( plus handles \) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape with a rounded bottom for easy stirring if you are looking for a versatile do it all pan this is a good choice	positive

amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered we hoped this one would be an exception it was but only in that it may be the poorest of them all ours buzzed loudly whenever in use never had a toaster buzz before we toast bread at least twice a day and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible it has no bagel setting \( which toasts the cut side more than the crust side \) so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast what s more it toasts completely unevenly one corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned and it s really annoying when a 4 slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently as far as looks go de longhi did just as bad a job the photos look cool but the crumb tray this unit sits upon is actually wider than the unit itself so there is a big uneven gap at the seam it s the lower line you see in the photos but they make it look real nice for that what you don t see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several mm from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown this makes it look broken like two pieces of something that no longer fit together if de longhi had spent even a second thinking about this they would have done the opposite the bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look \( we even went to a store yes a real store to confirm that they are all like this and they are \) also the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element there are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn t scratch the metal surface of the toaster however two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping and though they slipped right back in all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out \( only friction holds them in \) and you will loose them very quickly especially if you ever wash the rack we re happy to pay extra for a quality item even a toaster but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment final advice stick to the 20 toasters with functions such as bagel defrost and dual controls if it s ugly keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it this one looks broken performs poorly and costs a lot of money if you do buy this model maybe you ll get ours we returned it	negative

we travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we re sleeping the materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence the main body is plastic the metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door the serrations on the bar are not deep so don t promise much strength while none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in this one while prettily designed is overly expensive and unimpressive we re going to try a few others by the way in returning this item which we consider unsatisfactory amazon will charge us doubly the cost to return the item to amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our super saver shipping the end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer	negative

i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances the item itself works pretty good for the most part the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it to remedy the issue i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place i m not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find i used search terms like mini trash can counter top trash can small waste basket small stainless steel trash can but none of these got me to this item i m not sure how my husband finally found it	positive

this container is way too small to keep any fish in let alone two in such a small container the fishes wastes will build up quickly causing eye and skin irritation sickness even death you can try to reduce the waste build up changing the water frequently but not only is this a lot of work for you it is stressful for the fish in addition if you want to keep bettas in a divided tank there should be decorations for the fish to hide behind when they need a break from flaring at each other this tank is too small to allow that another source of stress thirdly bettas are tropical fish they need a tank heated to a constant 80f it is not possible to safely heat a tank that is smaller than 5 gallons if you want to get bettas please read some of the excellent websites available and learn all you can about their care if you cannot afford a proper tank please don t get a fish	negative

we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won t work unfortunately because it s rigid it slides up a dog s neck very easily i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can t slide even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position a shrug a shake or simply walking a few steps is all it takes this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs is not going to work it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems the dog now has another negative association to the person consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying f quall	negative
i bought this particular lever corkscrew because i read a very favorable review in consumer reports it is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears the guide and the frame after about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use i actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point end of story	negative

one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i d much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there s no washing machine that s also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i didn t hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it s difficult to push and feels like it s gripping to the floor it doesn t fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it s big fat part vacuum head and when you re finished it s a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you re supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you ve finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i don t review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i m hoping that they will one day	negative
i was going to buy the lello 45900 ariete espresso cappuccino maker because the price was so good but i waited over three months because it was not in stock so i looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price but after using it it s more than twice the machine i think on the amazon description it says the pump is a 16 bar pump but after checking reviews on different web sites i think amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites it says the a pump to be 17 5 bar pump that s even better and the other thing that i like was the fact that it had a cd that was not said on the description either i never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful shows and explains the basics from making espresso two frothing the milk cleaning tips and more very helpful so i made myself my first shot of espresso it was great nice little cream on top it just looked beautiful i didn t think it would work to good because i bought some pods and i wasn t sure how it would work works great taste great and easy to clean second day i made myself a latte again excellent third day i got adventurous i made myself my first cappuccino and again great put starbucks to shame the espresso i was using was the illy sucro espresso pods 906 naturally the espresso you use is actually more important than the machine i guess this one taste great about different type of syrups caramel vanilla hazelnuts irish cream the syrups brand was davinci so yes i am very satisfied with this machine and i guess i got lucky because this one was out of stock for a long time	positive

my wife got this cuisinart classic toaster oven as a wedding gift we liked the appearance and had it on our registry we used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well toast was perfect and the oven cooked nice and hot we broiled meats and made all kind of things in it we found it hard to clean we would take the baking pan and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter i glued it back on with super glue it broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so i had to fix this plastic foot a few times then another problem arose the toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start so to make toast we just used the un timed bake function but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast still we lived with it then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working so it does not bake i think i knew this was going to happen because i would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever i turned the dial to bake for a while so therefore i think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last i would have expected better quality considering how long we have been making toaster ovens i think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls so like other reviews say it does cook well and evenly but it is hard to clean and does not last if i were to have rated the product before the problems started i would have given it 4 stars i wish that amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products we are now looking into t fall convection toaster oven but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts since writing my review above i tried to fix my oven to no avail but i have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke my recommendations are as follows since i know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this classic model product can over time get dirty and stop working i recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops rice cookers deep fryers pressure cookers or kitchen sinks especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease i recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location this might make the unit last longer the newer cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem i had or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways maybe 1 5 years is average life or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products from the reviews and my observations above i think the krups models and the improved cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me	negative

having used hoover products in a commercial environment for many years i have had great service from them providing many years of dependable and powerful operation we were excited to try out this new hoover model one of the first things i have noticed about it over the previous windtunnel model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum this may bother some but i see it as a testament to it s improved build quality over the gen 1 windtunnel this machine is very powerful and it s dual turbine motor has a confident sound i ll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is it is a nice feature though i ll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is update after having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 1 \) lacks a bag full indicator the bag filled on this machine and then busted \( unknowlingly \) at the top around the bag collar stuff went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter it took another vacuum to clean the mess up in the future i will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle indicating how full the bag is getting 2 \) the cord rewinder is a nice feature but truly lacks quality it will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance a stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference 3 \) dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head not that it presents a problem but it s unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns	positive
this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year	negative

i must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan s nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after i began using it i m not talking about scratches which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning my pan began pock all over even up the sides where i rarely touch them i hung on to this pan for 3 years simply because i could not bear to part with it for the expense but eventually i had to treat it like my other all clad pans \( which i love \) and use full amounts of oil to cook it was no longer worth using although the reviewer who loves this pan was certain the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly that certainty is based on nothing but speculation i cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by all clad of course i could have asked all clad to replace it early on since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord but that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off	negative

we have owned the breadman corner bakery for about eight months now it has made our house smell wonderful i have to say i don t use the recipes that came with it so i won t judge those for the price this is a beautiful machine the pan has a solid heft to it not like some of the other bread makers with seemingly flimsy aluminum pans we have made many types of bread in it and have even churned butter from heavy cream the best kind of bread is the one made in the pan right after making butter with a toddler and a baby it is nice not to have to run to the store everyday to buy fresh bread or rolls the only time our bread has turned out not so good is when an ingredient has been forgotten without the yeast it wasn t quiet the same but our house smelled great	positive
the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn t this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt what a useless thing i m looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor this thing certainly doesn t do it if you re looking to buy this thing look again there must be something better if not just your regular broom	negative

when my krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service i decided to order the capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted cool grind i wish i had ordered the krups instead the capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee and the design ensures that no matter how careful you are you will spill ground coffee all over your counter in the time since i bought it another reviewer has reported that his or her capresso broke within six months do not buy this model	negative
i understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle you may think air only gets in when you pour oil out but that s not true any time the temperature rises the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout when the temperature drops air enters the spout this is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen if you don t use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid if you use cheap olive oil \( and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil even the extra virgin \) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils but it will still happen i would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again \( i learned this lesson the hard way \) a better option though less elegant is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it	negative
read the description carefully it states the speaker range is 50 not the microphone my dog stood 10 away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn t trigger matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand even then it didn t go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower i also couldn t get it to just make the ultrasonic sound even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise not just me but my husband too so it s not a case of super human hearing on my part \) yes the timer option is very nice this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking but what good is the timer function if the microphone can t pick up the barking so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else	negative
i bought this heater at lowe s after returning another delonghi model to amazon it s great for a bedroom because it is practically silent the heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm that was the good news the bad news is that after a few months it broke down it turns off when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up as another reviewer said it is now an attractive retro paperweight but that s about it i was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having i m not going to bother after battling with delonghi over other retro products i m giving up i won t buy any of their stuff anymore by the way if you want a great silent heater try the bionaire micathermic model \( bnrbh3900u \) it doesn t have the snazzy styling of the delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year	negative

the quality of the china is very good the weight and feel of the product is substantial i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family	positive

after buying an aluminum i read about the leaching of the mayerial into the food and the health risks involved i was advised to spend the extra money since this is a stock item i took it to wal mart and traded it for a 6 quart stainless boy was i surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as i used to have a sixx litter european and a whole chicken fits just fine anyway i can t recommend this because of the material and because of the size if i could afford it i would go for the electric pressure cooker with at least an 8 quart size of stainless cuisinart or other brands check amazon around 150 and up you get what you pay for	negative
i have used one crock pot or another for many years i bought this one because i was delighted with the sturdy removable stoneware bowl i really like this feature clean up is easy i use this crock pot for soups and beans because it cooks way too hot for anything else even so i need to stir from time to time apparently excessive temperature is the problem most people are having with this pot this might be a safety issue i would not keep this pot on and leave the house i am disappointed that the handle has broken off of the lid which really should not happen with normal use i lifted the lid to stir of course and off came the handle lifting the lid is definately normal use	negative
first the good news this is an extra heavy skillet with durable finish and good handles it easily handles two quarts up to the bottoms of the rivets and distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pan but for the bad news i would give this skillet four or five stars the bad news is that someone at the anolon plant damaged the pan before it was placed in the anolon carton neither the anolon box nor the outer ups shipping carton showed any damage when i received the skillet it wasn t until the the following day after i threw out the packaging that i noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly true i should have been more attentive when i received the pan but i never suspected anolon would package damaged goods i ll live with my mistake but will not purchase anything by anolon again	negative

i have used wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness but i sincerely regret having bought these sheets i purchased one set and after the 2nd wash there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on \( all the little balls felt scratchy \) my husband asked me why we were using the old sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn i was so suprised that i called wamsutta directly and the very nice lady there assured me that i must have gotten a defective set because that simply doesn t happen with their sheets so i exchanged them with an identical pair and the end of the story is that i am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing what a disappointment absolutely do not recommend and am now very wary of all wamsutta products	negative
it makes the cleanest and purest coffee i have ever tasted i also use a moka pot a french press and a drip and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot to those who had failures and could not get it apart i have no idea what you are doing wrong there is little to go wrong fill the lower pot put on the upper pot with grinds in it heat it watch the water infuse the grinds remove from heat and let it go back down what is there to go wrong if it fails to go back to the lower pot there must have been a vacuum leak pull it apart and let gravity do it or just stick something in it and dislodge the filter if you are in a hurry there is no vacuum up top so how the coffee got stuck up there defeats all i know about physics just dump the stuff into the sink if it fails to go back through the filter it is pretty simple if it doesn t work for you i d call it user error try again if you can boil water this should pose no problem i have used it 100s of times with not one failure	positive
i received this blender for x mas last year it has some nice design features \( good heavy base to prevent tipping measuring cup built into the cap \) however i experienced the same problems that others here have the blender doesn t do well with anything thick like milkshakes it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart while it worked ok for a while the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months	negative
i have always used the metal irons and was concerned about the nonstick i was afraid the structure would create thicker pizzelles which are more cookie like versus light and wafer the first ones came out and were sticking to the surface i was disheartened thinking i am having the same problem as with the metal i switched to nonstick to avoid this oh well try again and from that moment on was smooth sailing i like the light indicator on this model the easy clean up storage design just everything	positive
i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave	negative
i have owned this unit for 2 years the water seems ok and definitely better than from the tap however every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back the replacement cartridges are very expensive there is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter and this knob recently has broken off we cannot seem to access the company s website to get a replacement part i am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether i would not buy again \( also i have had lots of problems with their water bottles leakage breaking etc i won t buy any product from this company again	negative
i bought these molds for my crystal light drinks so that i could have a more nutritious dessert option the molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money the plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom impossible to get back out and the taste will go with it i have fun using these and they were reasonably priced	positive

after using my roomba for a year and loving it i decided to splurge and buy scooba wow i think i love it even more than my roomba i turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it when i return i have a gorgeous shiny clean smelling floor once a week i wrap a damp washcloth around my swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny all the time scooba is a miracle i did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box i had to prime the pump to get it going my only suggestion to irobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming scooba in the box instead of making people go to the irobot website to troubleshoot obviously from reading the reviews you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem fortunately that s the only trouble i ve ever had with it i ve never had to prime again and it works flawlessly i m very impressed with scooba	positive
this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb chickens it s also good for a large casserole for a pot luck the pan looks good from oven to table yes it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron but i m really glad to add this to my pantry	positive
ive had this vacumn for about 2 years after about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way still has very good power bad news it doesnt move around easy it is like dragging an old tire around hard to turn and direct canister always rolls over the only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt and dont vacumn that often i guess because i dread using it i am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while but still like i said lots of power if you keep the filter clean	negative
i recently purchased this double boiler and i am very happy with it it is a good quality stainless and that is important i love the vintage style it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape much like one that grandma had many years ago the boiler insert is 6 deep not counting the lid and perfect for making frosting candy custard anything that requires gentle cooking	positive

we ve had this for about five years the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery the battery is soldered to the circuit board they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost 20 each way i opened it up cut out the old battery and duct taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months cooks rice great though	negative
we got this rice cooker as a christmas gift we ve tried cooking rice in it three times and all three times the rice has burned it simply gets too hot like some of the other reviewers we added more and more water but it didn t help the cooker finally does kick into warm mode but by then it s too late we were thrilled when we realized it was non stick but what good is non stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible	negative

too bad i didn t come here first at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did it s too bad too because this thing is a technological marval except it s defective from the very start my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is ideal so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water doesn t boil \( add salt \) or if it boils too rapidly \( add distilled water \) this will prevent spurting boiling over and overheated reservoirs the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already the unit boils like the bejesus on low putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking reset refill light i tried 4 times and even called tech support \( they were pretty clueless are you listening bionaire \) it s really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you can t tilt it to fix the problem \( most warm mist are designed that way for some reason	negative

i purchased this coffee maker and in three months time threw it out what a piece of you can never get a decent hot cup of coffee \( it is lukewarm at best \) and the carafe not only breaks so you have to replace it but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup what a dissapointment this machine is mr coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor i would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone the only nice thing i can say about it is the programmable timer worked i would not give this coffee maker one star but that was the lowest rating available if it were up to me i would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating	negative

i was very impressed with the infomercials on this product and was about to buy the set before i read a very detailed and thorough online review at http www epinions com content 180924944004 the reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product among her pet peeves things do stick to the product use a flour cooking spray for better results odors do stay with the product not easy to clean the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps size of the pieces are small the pieces are so flexible that if you don t place the food neatly in the pan you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results you can slice through the product easily guarantee is shakey at best and so on there are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light and more importantly i personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis i for one definitely will not buy this product please consider this recap of another s review a public service buyer beware	negative
this is great easy set up dishwasher safe \( top shelf only \) and super quiet \( there is a very faint humm \) our cats went right over to check it out it is kinda big but i expected that from the picture the only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher 5 stars i d give it more if i could	positive

if i could give this product 0 stars i would read the negative reviews folks and be forewarned i believed the positive reviews and ignored the negative ones much to my exasperation when i plugged my handsome new oven in the little red digital display numbers came on right away hmmm so far so good but according to the instructions you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell sooo the owner s manual says to push the bake button on the dashboard which in turn lights the pilot lid light on the display after which you can set time and temp so i push the bake button and nothing happens no lid light comes on nothing zilch zippo so i then push the temp and time lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up still nothing i unplugged it and and plugged it in again thinking that maybe somehow i had screwed that up while listening for the beep the owner s manual said should happen whence the unit is plugged in zilch zippo nothing no beep no bake lid light tried pusing the temp and time buttons again nada tried unpugging it again and doing the whole shebang all over again still nothing it just sat there and grinned at me about this time i figured out that my unit was also dead on arrival at least you can get a parcel paid bill of lading printed off from the amazon website for a defective product return saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product you have already paid for and now must wait weeks to get a refund on amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse and run them over with a forklift	negative

the first use wasn t too bad it cut things well but the lock locks too easily without something even touching it so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use safety is nice but that is just annoying the biggest problem is the coil spring is not stainless steel so the inside of it rusts even if you take it apart for each washing once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult toclose the shears making cutting a real pain literally i soak the spring regularly in rust remover but i can not use it no more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand my prior shears lasted for 10 years but these i need to replace after a couple of months	negative

as a vintner we remove the co2 from the wine as part of our process this device uses co2 to pop the cork very clever however this minor introduction of co2 is insignificant and will vent quickly at times there is an off taste like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine let it breath for a while 5 minutes or so and it seems ok this device works well on corks but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective rew	positive

we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the rechargable battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one	negative
at first we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner after one year however it started sounding like a jet engine the turbo nozzle had broken i live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things and when i ordered a new turbo nozzle they sent a mini it turns out that the actual replacement nozzle listed at 29 99 a year ago now costs 125 00 the explanation i got was prices are subject to change without notice now i m stuck with a 5 inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me plus the cord which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button creeps in while we re vacuuming and when we press the button too i love it at first but i ll never buy another electrolux it s not well made and they don t stand behind their product	negative

this pillow looks simple enough but there must have been a lot of research put into inventing it the dogbone \( medium size about 16 w i don t remember specific dimensions \) instantly relieved many aches i had in my neck without forcing me to lie down in a flat position \( which often gives me a headache and makes it impossible to read while lying down \) i d been to the doc quite a few times for the back neck problems i ve had lately but no rx worked quite as well as this delightful cushion my only issues with it are cleaning \( stuffing s packed very tight so i d rather not try it out in the washer for fear of mold mildew i spray it with disinfectant every once in a while instead \) the outer material \( an optional moisture wicking or allergen reducing pillowcase would be nice \) however i bought it based on earlier reviews and i don t regret it	positive
great item just what i needed the price was fine and the company reputation was a serious consideration in my selection	positive
a collegue of mine raved about it she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office i tried it for a day but was not convinced either way then i bought the largest model and tried it at home i used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the acid test i used it in the toilet room closed the door and let it sit there for 8 hours when i inspected the room i could still smell what i smelled 8 hours earlier and i so wanted it to work the other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor \( as does a hepa air filter \)	negative
the first dishwasher that i received from etronics was dented dirty and looked as though it had been used i complained they picked it up and one month later i got the replacement it wasn t in much better shape but i kept it anyway because i was tired of waiting the dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes and although it cleans well the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made and it leaks even with teflon tape i would not make this purchase again	negative
cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you ll have bases covered	positive

order the wok and got it damaged \( off shaped \) the packaging is horrible basiclly they put the bare wok in the box filled with the giant air bubbles the wok can move around freely in the box guess the damage is caused during shipping return and reordered the typhoon carbon steel wok similar size and design 3 cheaper when i got it i am very pleased with the quality \) properly packaged plastic cover on the top sheet of paper on the bottom fitted in a box designed for it \) thick steel 2 5mm rather than 1 8mm from joyce chen \) handles are welded on the wok so no dead spot when cleaning \) seasoning instruction are well documented in 8 different languages even thou i use my own seasoning way not like joyce chen s one thin sheet of paper with not so clear instruction overall joyce chen s wok is like the one you can get from chinatown supermarket and typhoon one is like from macy s	negative
we purchased the delonghi based on its ease of cleaning \( 4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher \) after the third use the plastic part that holds the heating element in place melted off the base delonghi service was apologetic and promised to send a replacement part asap although the part was out of stock that was in september almost 6 months ago parts are still backordered i returned the unit to lowes in frustration got a new unit and it too melted on the first use returned it for credit do not consider this unit	negative

this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole soup tureen handles are sturdy but short so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder but easy to grip with bare hands because of this feature you may decide to use this as a serving dish only good for a large group rather than due to large capacity we are a family of 2 so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox	positive

i really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush unfortunetly it is just messy annoying and takes up counter space when you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction if the cereal is too big \( honeycomb size \) it doesn t come out easily if it is too small \( fruity pebbles \) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere i definetly would not buy this product again at one point i even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away the time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter	negative

this is a great idea but i think it might need more tweaking the reservoir holds a lot of water which is good but there is no filter so any cat hair stray food or whatever your 18 month old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl then it sits there usually after sinking to the bottom until you dig it out also with mine at least you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear a shame since the cat really did like the few bubbles i was able to coax out if this somehow filtered the water and made bubbles i d be all over it \( like cat hair on a pastel couch \)	negative

i initially bought this coffeemaker because i remembered my dad s sunbeam silex type coffeemaker it made great coffee and so does the bodum problem with the bodum is that i had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material the folks at bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem i am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if i continue to have a problem	negative
as stated before in many a review this machine is the best deal for the money paired with a real espresso grinder \( which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself \) this machine is capable of producing real espresso my father bought this for me for my birthday back in december and the machine is still in working condition my only real beef with this machine is the wand i can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher however the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off right into my milk i have taken to using the wand without either of them on but this isn t optimum for latte foam the only other thing that bothers me is that i have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead this is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing but i d rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra 300 for something in stainless steel all in all the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time i use it woohoo by zoe ros not tim	positive

when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b c the materials are light weight but i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic it was just so easy and looked so good i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer unlike other reviewers i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts	positive
this has been a nightmare when i received the chair i couldn t wait to put it together however the holes for the screws were too big and therefore i was unable to secure the pieces i called and asked if the the right size screws could be sent i was told that there were no provisions for that but they would be happy to send me another one \( i could return the faulty one in that box \) very nice i thought well i got the second one the screws are too small for the holes now i am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on i don t recommend this item	negative

i was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did i find a nice one with the arched back speaker portion of the stereo it provides a surround sound like atmosphere also it has quite a loud capacity for volume i mean if you wanted to you could really get it crankin anyway it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod the sound clarity is very crisp and clear the only tiny flaw i could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs a soft high pitched whine is sometimes incurred however once the song begins to play this whine disapears immediately i would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price	positive
i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses my wife can even use it without burning stuff which she admits is a feat for her so she uses it several times a week too it holds heat well cleans up easy and the lip on the corner works great for draining only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove with gas you should be fine it hasn t seemed to effect the performance though and for the money it is quite perfect	positive
i bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day this is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves some of the honeycombs get a little crushed but i ve found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them reese s puffs and cheerios also came out without any crushing you have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh maybe this was in the directions but i missed it and learned the hard way but the kids figured out the caps easily and it s not a big deal for them	positive

i had researched this product for juicing ability and power i ended up buying this one and after using it twice the motor just shut off i returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement i decided to try juicing carrots and celery and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again i might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it if you are juicing small things like berries with larger vegetables fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade i know i read these bad reviews and said oh that won t happen to me but it did i hope you choose a different juicer	negative
i bought this for my 2 dogs it works great cleans up easily the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it s large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home it doesn t fit under my kitchen sink faucet i don t have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer \( wish i did \) \) otherwise it would be a snap to fill i have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs the container is really heavy once it s full my only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one \( 2 gallon or 1 gallon \) waterer it would be easier to handle i also bought the 5 gallon feeder i love it it holds a whole 5lb bag of food which is great so get the larger feeder the smaller waterer oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it	positive

i ve been a chef for almost 15 years and a knife is one of the tools i reach out most of the time during those years i ve used all kinds of brands including kershaw wusthof mundial and even smart and final brand and to be more specific an 8 inch chef s knife is my favorite after having fun with these toys i thought it s time to reward myself with an ultimate gift so i sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive one day i came across the shun classic on the amazon web this knife sets itself apart from the others the simplicity in design the beauty of the blade the sharpness and finally its steel quality the blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a samurai s sword wow the d shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood it fits in my hand nicely but the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness i can slice pieces of lemons micro thin it s not only super sharp but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels i experienced with it weighs a little heavier but i m sure that s not a big deal for me cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there isn t any corner which will accumulate grease shun 8 inch classic is the best i ve ever had you won t regret what you pay for even though the price is very high a good chef deserves a good steel	positive
i grind beans for my coffee every morning i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder sold the old grinder in a garage sale i do regret buying this grinder it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 my main complaint is that it is messy the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it also coffee grounds are everywhere i always have to use a cloth to clean up not a good buy	negative

most importantly this is small this is the same size as one person clay pot rice or bibimbap it is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout one cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion i have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around now that i have received my shipment i know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but i have grown to prefer the red it s so pretty it didn t arrive chipped or anything so there s not much to say about how it works just keep the heat between medium to low i broke it in by making hot milk \( from powder \) with banana so yeah as a pot it heats stuff up no leaks p s one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that i saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating yes i did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in i still don t know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but i hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies i think this try me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl	positive
i bought this when my air popper died i am so glad i found this product the popcorn is the best it is very simple to make the thing i like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn i can choose which oil to use how much so i have total control over what goes into my popcorn so i feel confident that what i am eating is good for me the packaged corn that came with was ok a good introduction to using the popper but i will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own i did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book it was fantastic i would recommend this to anyone the popper is easy to handle easy to clean it makes the best crisp crunchy popcorn ever it only takes about 3 minutes to be done you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings sometimes simple old fashioned is better that is the case with this item now we can t wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night	positive

this juicer is extremely heavy made of industrial type metal parts but it s poorly machined and assembled the heavy parts don t fit together well and the juicer is wobbly and unstable despite it s heaviness i am sending this back without using it once becuase there s no way to adjust the parts and it s too unstable to use as is also it really is almost impossible to pick up and move due to the weight without straining your back finally like a reviewer of the orange x large size juicer i find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places it seem like the kind of company where to get a good product you d have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one	negative
this is a very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner if you just need to clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it will perform great should you actually try to use the beater brush attachment you will be very dissappointed i bought this cleaner for the purpose of cleaning my curtians and stairs i own two cats and virtually all of my in laws are allergic to them everytime they come i have to clean the house top to bottom my upright vacuum \( dirt devil vision lite model 008650 \) weighs a ton and was not designed to use on stairs i thought this little cleaner might be just the trick the brush worked great the first several times i used it but after about 20 uses it began to slow down i cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw the initial performance again eventually it stopped working at all i urge you to buy something else if the beater brush is a selling point for you	negative
i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try it does a perfect job i owned the original model when it first came out years ago this one is more streamlined and improved the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups	positive
i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities its so light about nine pounds and easy to transport and store its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum they are very easy to get at and change its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors along baseboards and on stairways not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool many third party vacuum attachments would work with it too i am glad i bought it and would recommend it its the vacuum i would use most the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done push a button and the cord automatically rewinds whats not to like about this vacuum highly recommended	positive

the bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status this causes the fabric to be so thin you can just about see your hand through it also out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled the good news is that the red border color that i chose did not bleed in the washer further they did not shrink at all i don t know how they feel to sleep on as they are for a guest bed for occasional use only just by the way they look if i were to use them daily i would have returned them	negative

we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would i have numerous sharpening stone \( ceramic diamond \) and buffing wheels and sharpened them myself to a razors edge again they worked well but soon became very dull we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance they are well balanced looked well made but are over rated and priced the 2 mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer take abuse better and sharpen easier	negative

all 6 of of the glasses in my set were at least slightly misshapen one was positively a mutant the stems were not centered and there were for lack of a better description glass tumors where the bowls meet the stems the glasses were also thicker than i expected from spiegalau other spiegalau items i ve purchased have been superb so this could very well be an anomaly	negative

it appears that the viatek product \( bark stop pro \) is related to the lentek design \( pc16 asin b0002q89o6 \) they are based on a common design by a lentek engineer i have used \( tried \) the viatek bark stop pro and it definitely does not work my experience was the same as another reviewer of the lentek pc16 who noted that the unit only works on the audible setting dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ultrasonic setting furthermore it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds banging doors wind noise etc this really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction quality i ve tried two different units and they both do not work the negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks	negative
i have nice sharp blades i sliced veggies and got all these tiny little plastic hairs that the cutting mat gave off as i sliced it up along with my veggies had to toss them these mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough or any other purpose other than for what they are made for chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects for the price it was worth testing them out	negative

admittedly i am a bit of a knife buying nut i love kitchen knives and own chef s knives and santuko knives from wusthof henckels kyocera and furi this calphalon katana 6 inch chef s knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance wise i like the way the handle is shaped it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious i love the way it looks too for the price i d say you can t go wrong i really like it a lot i have only had it for a few weeks though but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we ll see how well it resharpens when the need arises	positive
i received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed it is just not warm enough even on the highest setting it doesn t get warm enough initially it is fine for keeping warm during the night but i want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does it is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well not worth the money at all	negative

was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	negative

i needed a saucepan to cook oatmeal in that would let go on the bits that stick to the bottom sounds silly but i love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards this cleans up easily and cooks evenly i have used it for cooking rice gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well now for the lid there is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently i sat down wrote an email to the company and by the next day they have a new lid on the way they asked only where to send it nothing else i like companies that stand by the product they sell so if you are going to buy from this line check that black band it should be between the glass and the metal not on the inside of the lid if you have a problem with the product always notify the manufacturer they will almost always make it right like calphalon did for me	positive
getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic this is a big help the wide base allows better balance than you would think and is really very secure i would prefer a larger balance point but this does the job	positive
the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again	negative

i ve have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths they are also a nice large size so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they cannot be wrung out properly the colors of the towels are also beautiful i m buying more for our guest bathroom thank goodness i searched on amazon i don t believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else	positive
my 13 year old cat was limping for a few days off and on and my vet said it was probably arthritis a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try it really made a difference he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake he was so happy and so was i on my vet s recommendation i continued giving him one tuna flavored capsule each day sprinkled over his food as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis and buying it from amazon saved me about 2 3 of the cost from the vet	positive
i think i m a little crazy for buying this i just had to find out if the copper core was really better than an aluminum one it is but not by that much you can buy a pan from cuisinart s multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price that being said this thing is very well designed the rolled lip is useful for pouring the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there \( a problem with most pans \) the handle stays cool and is well designed overall this is the best 2 quart saute pan money can buy is it worth it that s up to you	positive
i have had this unit for 8 months and haven t had any problems it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand and i have very small hands some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin	positive

i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz it does a reasonable job cleaning transforming my carpet from does she ever vacuum to oh she must have vacuumed yesterday it doesn t get all the fuzz and crumbs but it does what i d expect from a sweeper it is also much lighter than my vacuum so i m much more likely to use it my three year old daughter enjoys using it too she insists on sweeping her own room \( i won t complain \) the main thing i ve learned is that because the handle slides together it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle the sweeper will probably fall off so pick it up near the sweeper \( it stays together fine when actually sweeping	positive
it works fine but my cat won t use it i was thrilled with the reviews i read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived unfortunately i like it better than my cat does he largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass oh well before you buy make sure it s not the sound of the water that attracts your cat this fountain has no water sound \( pretty quite actually \) i think that s why my cat ignores it	negative

this is a great cookie sheet i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it s durable my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality i would highly recommend this pan especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only 30 a great deal	positive
being used to the swiftness of the roomba \( 10 stars \) the scooba seems very slow it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle the floor is clean and sweet smelling on the downside my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine	positive
the kitchen odors were getting very bad we realized that the filter had never been changed it is an old recirculating system over the stove finding filters is for the birds filters are all listed by a serial or code number i think the psychology is that you use only the filter from the original manufacturer after looking at many different types of filters these seemed to be cutable is that a word we did not need to cut they fit into the nutone range hood perfectly our nutone hood is so old that we could not find anything listed on the nutone site so these fit the house odor while cooking is diminished what is not clear is how often they should be replaced obviously when the smell gets worse but i have no idea if 6 months or 6 years will buy more cheaper than a new hood	positive

my son who lives in washington uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer we live in california but bought this fan to help vent our computer room which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled it works great we plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down	positive

i bought this sheet set the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son he too loves star wars and as i read the other reviews im nodding my head these sheets feel like burlap i have washed them regularly since december with no improvement they dont fade though which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 polyester and only 30 cotton very stiff and scratchy	negative
my company bought one of these to replace the similar capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after n years after 2 days the led readout of the functional information stopped working the machine continues to operate but you can t tell what s going on how much water it will use for your particular cup etc very disappointing we ll see how good the warranty repair is and report back to you after we experience that	negative
after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one it has been great and i couldn t ask for anything better or more easy to use i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross odors or tastes my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated cleanup is easy also after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be i would recommend this with no caveats	positive
i have tried all kinds of feather pillows and foam pillows but just could not get comfortable sleeping on my side while shopping for a new mattress i came across the simmons beautyrest pillow what a difference it provides great support but is still soft and comfortable now i don t toss and turn all night and i actually get up earlier in the morning and feel rested for the first time in a long time i definitely recommend this pillow for people who sleep on their side and are looking for good support	positive

i ve had my futon a little over two months and was very happy with it initially until one day two of the wooden slats which are all held in place with plastic fell apart \( and i only weigh 100lbs \) i tried everything to fix the problem to no avail so considering it only lasted a few months it really is not worth the money at all the price is cheap but so is the quality for what it will cost me to replace this one i could ve bought a much better quality futon without the disappointment and aggravation	negative
i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot	negative
i ve had a lot of problems using this my sister has one and loves it but for me it leaks	negative
as far as whisks for non stick surfaces go the silicone encased wires are very flexible a far cry from the hard thick plastic whisks with only a few wires they are ideal for non stick surfaces except for one problem the silicone is soft and not durable after a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer the silicone gets easily cut the silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose i have been very careful but this works out to probably 2 each time i used it	negative
i ve been using spiegelau wine glasses for several years and they are excellent the bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine these glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine \( they re also not bad for rhones though i prefer the reidel vinum syrah glass \) if you drink a lot of burgundy or pinot noir or italian piedmont wines \( barolo barbaresco langhe \) i d suggest spiegelau s burgundy glass if your preference is zinfandel or chianti you re a bit out of luck with spiegelau however their chianti glass isn t very good try the riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines you ll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet some reviewers have complained about breakage i ve seldom broken a glass but it does occasionally happen during washing my method is to clear the sink run the water as hot as possible put a bit of dishsoap in each glass i then use a special ultra soft brush \( which i got at a local wine shop for about 6 \) to clean the glass removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim then rinse thoroughly with very hot water invert on cloth after about half an hour with the glasses almost dry you can wipe them off with paper towels \( which don t leave any lint behind \) and put them away the main thing is never to lay them down in the sink and wash one glass at a time just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you re doing don t try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying just use the paper towels finally even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe i don t know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher dishwashers always leave a film and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses which lose their clarity as a consequence	positive
this nifty piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so i got it i really wanted to get the air o swiss one but alas it cannot be found or shipped to canada weirdly so far i am less than impressed took me forever to even get it working the constant resetting is tiring i did find a solution \( initial anyway \) you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir \( where the round filter is \) and then it works the noise it makes is not easy to get used to no matter how tired you are i am trying it for one night then if i can t sleep i will return it it s not worth the money my advice save up and get the air o swiss	negative

the pan arrived on time and undamaged in the factory box the nonstick surface is slicker than the hardened titanium one used on scanpan and cleans easily the rotating vent on the glass lid is a nice feature my wife was skeptical at first but i ve caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently in fact it s become their favorite pan unlike a pure teflon finish this pan will brown the food nicely as far as durability goes well it s too early to tell but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product i like it	positive
i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it the metal is thin and flimsy and the construction very poor \( e g little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose \) also it was a bit lopsided so it did not sit squarely on my counter maybe it works fine who knows the design and manufacture were so poor i didn t keep it long enough to find out	negative
if i had to do it over again i would try a different mat \( something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic \) pros 1 reduces tracking somewhat 2 more attractive than other litter mats 3 doesn t take up too much space cons 1 my cat doesn t like it most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet 2 it s too smal	negative

before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i ve tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud don t waste your mone	negative

the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisserie the grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals	positive
we have owned other hoover steam cleaners they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet we bought the hoover f5914 900 based on the reviews i was confident that it wouldn t leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack i couldn t keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job ok our hoover came my husband put it together and it leaked all over i then re read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them by then we had already taken it to the repair center after a week they had not touched it my husband picked the machine up and brought it home we decided to start from square one and put it together again he did following the directions to the letter lo and behold no leaks yeah my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman so the moral to this story is always read the directions first	positive

i have really nice dansk everyday dishes but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use i have to admit these dishes are really stylish they look great on the table are very lightweight stack very compactly and are a nice large size the only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls they are small and while they look really cool the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around if you re looking for bigger bowls for cereal you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that corelle makes for salads the square ones work just fine a word of pricing caution on amazon at this moment they are 69 a set i bought mine for 49 per set at my local walmart	positive

we purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use we make probably 20 30 cups of coffee a day our problems began the first week after receiving it the machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam which lattes shouldn t have so customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy we called the manufacturer s customer service and were rudely brushed off for a small business like us it is hard to close for 2 3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service so we had to deal with it another problem came up 3 4 weeks later when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate just to steam milk at the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours which we did it did not shut off for 1 day the next day the problem started again i perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily so you can not say that the machine is being neglected we are very disappointed with this machine for the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite understanding and helpful now we are looking for another machine a back up one to be able to send impressa z5 for service	negative
what people don t think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug i m not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it i have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross especially water who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face not me not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything it smells good and i can t imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some a great mug you should buy	positive
this set is so versatile i bought these because i own the red le creuset cookware and they matched them i thought that i would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard but the longer i own them the more uses i find for them great for appetizer containers for making mini casseroles \( or quiches \) creme brulee serving soup i ve even baked mini bread loaves in them the only recommendation i have is to buy two sets i usually end up using four at a time instead of two	positive

corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo	negative

disappointing at best i was truly disappointed in this item after purchasing it we followed the directions for conditioning the non stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as before each use as listed in the use and care guide it sounds simple enough wait for the green indicator light to come on add the batter close but do not latch the lid the green light will go off when it comes back on the waffle is ready the only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue the waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts we said well ok maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it before they start to come out right 7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first the price is great the design is nice the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work at least not for us i told my wife i would take it back to the store and exchange it she said don t you dare bring another one of those things home with you it s to bad too we both love waffles	negative
i have to admit that i love this set especially since i found it hard to find white flannel sheets most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen so when i found these and at this price i was quite happy they feel great not the best flannel but nice all the same but after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore later the fitted started getting holes so since this was rather cheap i am not horribly sad about it so if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning this is the set for you	negative
i loved these sheets when i first got them they look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them after laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases i have laundered these in tide with no bleach what a shame they did not hold up well	negative
if you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed don t i have two areobeds i bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out the pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it fifteen years later it still works like a charm i liked it so much i recently bought a minute bed because i needed another guest bed it does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa the battery is nicad which means it develops a memory so now even if i remembered to charge it the day before it does not run long enough to inflate the bed they do not offer a separate electric detachable pump so now i m stuck with a plastic carpet that cannot be inflated with anything else the areobeds work great but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion buy a different type	negative

i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years and in general i have been happy with them but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used the product description does warn you that it s only heat resistant to 250 degrees but i was flipping eggs in a skillet which i consider a basic use for a spatula if it can t handle the heat of a hot skillet than i don t think it s a useful spatula not to mention that it s neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food	negative

i should have paid more attention to the reviews i was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn t be used as an everyday or long term solution we ve been using the crate for less than three months and already the zipper one one end \( that we use all the time \) is screwed up and half the time it doesn t open at least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out but i m afraid of the morning when i try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck \( we leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in when she gets a little older we will leave her in her crate all day \) we could still use the zippers on the top but we don t like those since the dog can t get in and out at her leisure although in general it s a nice crate i probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers hence the two stars i am completely surprised that we only got three months use out of it before the zippers bit the dust we ve already purchased a different sturdier latch style crate that we re much happier with and we should have bought to start with	negative
being a wine lover i ve used all kinds of corkscrews from your basic twist model to the kind with the wings to the two pronged kind finally i received the screwpull as a gift and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end as others have said the screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up so there s no actual pulling whatsoever all you do is simiply turn the easy to use lever at the top of the device in almost 10 years of usage the screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try \( probably because i started too close to the edge \) simply starting over solved the problem spend a little more money to buy the screwpull and you ll never need to buy another corkscrew again highly recommended	positive
i was looking for an offset serrated knife as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill outstanding veggie slicer and all around food prep instrument even over ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights	positive
do not buy this product it is not supplied with a parts list to order parts that may become broken if your call their customer service number everyone is very courteous however they want pictures of the power base \( front back top and bottom \) as well as a picture of the menu book they want all of this just to order a simple o ring gasket that goes on the the blender blade piece to act as a seal they will not sell you this item \( package of 4 for 7 95 \) without all of the above information as well as a receipt i find that all of this would be unessary if they would just supply a simple parts list dyanand	negative

i received this coffeemaker as a christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket style filter after using the maker for a week i have to say my skepticism was unjustified this machine makes great tasting coffee that is as hot as i could want it i never liked the cooked coffee that regular glass carafe makers produced burned tasting after the first cup the coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last i fill the carafe with hot water mill my beans and fill the reservoir empty the carafe and enjoy after two hours the coffee was still hot one great feature not highlighted is the front fill aspect kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front right next to the filter no more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level extremely convenient i have to disagree with the previous reviewer this machine makes ten 5 ounce cups after reading the review i double checked the carafe capacity against my old krups machine exactly 10 cups more than enough for our household all in all a great looking great performing coffeemaker that meets kitchenaid s high standards i highly recommend it	positive
i find it hard to give this even a 1 star given the price i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers here s why i am sorely disappointed 1 \) the stainless steel does in fact rust and corrode 2 \) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains no openings so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew 3 \) check your water softness because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly	negative

well after reading the reviews of this vacuum i decided to give it a try i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i didn t like i thought i d give it some time though and hoped i could adjust here is what i found 1 the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated 2 worse than the vacuum being heavy the darn thing is really hard to push even on hard smooth surfaces it s hard to push i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag for it to drag on hard surfaces it must be a design flaw 3 the on off power switch is foot operated not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i couldn t find it by looking down it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off unfortunately the damage was done the belt snapped how nice i really liked that first time out and the belt snapped another note about the switch there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it s a real challenge maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes hey dirt devil here is an idea how about putting the on off switch on the push handle what a novel idea doh 4 the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose the main reason being is that the hose it too short it s like you are fighting the hose all the time it gets tiring 5 the detachable hose is really hard to re install in it s port you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat 6 the vacuum is terrible on rugs on any of the floor height settings it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn t get all caught up i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it it jammed up every time 7 the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back i have to use the hose attachment 8 the vacuum is horrible on steps with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position easy deal the dirt devil does not work that way when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted one little problem with that the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking you don t get a good positive suction so you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position it often locks and so then you have to try and un lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth it s a joke the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops now for pros 1 the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up it almost makes my carpet look like new and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister some vacuums like to just tear up carpets 2 the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else i can t imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies maybe i ll be lucky and the motor will die soon then i ll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil steve	negative
as i tend to nurse a cup of tea at the office for a while i decided to purchase this product this after looking around for a good desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug such a product just doesn t seem to exist check the amazon customer ratings i had one a number of years ago and it was lousy \( had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap but no one has \) i purchased this mug just about a month ago it s so good i had to share the secret and even if an improved electric warmer did exist i don t think i d bother with its cord and risks given how good this is i m sorry to see though that it s no longer available through amazon \( perhaps elsewhere on the web \) i can make a mug of tea \( a generous 20 oz \) around 10a m and even by mid to late afternoon 4 or 5p m it s still warm enough to enjoy and that s after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough to drink indeed if there s a fault with it it s almost too efficient if you use boiling water for the tea and want to take a sip right after you ve finished brewing though called a travel mug it won t fit into any auto cupholder i ve seen it s really perfect for a desk it s relatively low \( taller than a typical ceramic mug though \) the base is nice and wide and there s a ring of rubber silicone type material \( which has not scuffed anything on my desk \) around the edge of the bottom that really is non slip between these features it seems quite stable the removable black plastic top \( friction secured with the typical silicone type o ring around the edge \) allows you to move the opening anywhere you want to use left or right handed there s a simple slide to open close the drinking aperature the interior is also stainless steel so no plastic taste even with boiling water inside the outside remains virtually at room temperature \( as you d expect given its thermal efficiency \) my only complaint \( minor \) is that it is not dishwasher safe \( and i haven t tested it \) but it s easy to hand wash with the wide mouth you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom i have several inexpensive auto insulated mugs \( key word here i think is inexpensive \) that are truly underwhelming so initially i didn t have high expectations for this but it really is fantastic if you want a hot beverage to keep for several hours on your desk this is for you no regrets	positive

this vacuum cleans reasonably well but i have a few significant gripes which will prevent me from buying a similar model when making my next vacuum purchase which seems to about every 2 years i ve finally decided that we may go with an heirloom vacuum next time such as an oreck since the lifetime of any sub 100 vacuum is just ridiculous my complaints 1 this thing screams like a banshee it is indeed light and reasonably powerful but it literally hurts my ears to use it in small rooms it does not roar it emits a relatively high pitched scream i have had big small and medium size vacuums and this thing easily is louder than all of them i haev a 2 1 2 horsepower shop vac which is much quieter than this vacuum 2 wheels barely extend below the bottom of the vacuum so it requires a bit of effort to roll over anything but very short carpet wheeling from room to room say over hardwood while tipping the vacuum back also cannot really be done 3 the filter is hard to clean as it has a flange that extends down over maybe 1 3 of one side i often have to stick my finger in the space between the filter and the flange to get a significant amount of gunk out gross tell me how this is better than a bag	negative

i have only had it for a few days but moving up from a krups pump system with only 1050w of heating this unit rocks it used to take me about 10 minutes to make a latte with the krups as it took forever to heat uo and never made enough steam this unit heats very fast and makes fantastic steam for the frother which works fantastic minus the complaint everyone has the frother is way to low to the ground they fixed this with the evolution model watch the video the tamping and normal uses need to be followed very closely i have to use the perfect crema device to make crema which it does great this unit also can be used to heat water for tea in like 2 mins which is pretty cool you just fire up the unit wait till it heats then flip the espresso switch not the steam switch with the steam adjuster already open then hot water comes from the frother and boom tea the drip tray is worthless and is supposedly fixed in the evolution model but for 200 this machine is amazing very professional level equipment the abs shell is pretty flimsy but if it stays on the counter which mine does it will be fine i don t need to spend another 300 for the stainless model even though i would if i has a nicer kitchen just so it matched \( i rent but still have really nice appliances \)	positive
being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons firstly there is no auto shut off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly secondly when using batteries they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries this light is also extremely fragile over a couple of years i went through 7 of these i would not recommend this light for the amount you spend on the never ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply and the constant new purchases after it breaks you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises \( available at barnes nobel come on and get it in stock amazon \) it is terrific it has a clock with an alarm and a timer you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes at that time you can extend the minutes if you don t do so for example you re sleeping it will automatically shut off it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light	negative

i purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep i have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans my son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus saying he hasn t slept this good in a long time the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and i too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom very sturdy steel construction easy assembly of the legs 3 speeds top speed is out of this world almost like a wind storm me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house what a riot i highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation sleep aid and some silly fun	positive
the scale does not come with a battery even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it all of this i can live with the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself when turned on it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds i timed it 40g for one minute \( and after hours just keep on going \) the box had no signs of damage so i m guessing the load cell was bad very disappointing	negative

great product too bad the shipping cost as much as the produc	positive
it s small enough to fit in my little kitchen it works as advertised the waffles were fast to make clean up is easy hardly any needed i made mine very light \( folded in whipped egg whites after the batter was all mixed up \) i can imagine making these heart shaped waffles for dessert	positive
this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor the pur 2 stage dispenser specifically i found two main flaws 1 the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser as a result quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking even after tipping over the dispenser 2 even more infuriatingly the spigot s connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week i dutifully exchanged it for another one which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks it appears that the o ring that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator despite being a lifelong brita user i exchanged this product for a pur 2 stage dispenser i am now converted and will never go back the dispenser is rock solid and the water even tastes better	negative

this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces however once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware you ll want to buy more over the years i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well known commercial cookware brand but all clad is far superior the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well balanced making them very easy to handle they heat evenly and cook uniformly even over low and medium heat i am very pleased with all clad s performance on my radiant cooktop i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance well worth every penny	positive

i am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the kitchenaid brand this blender is only one of several ka appliances i have purchased that only lasted about a year i don t use a blender much maybe once a month so when this died after only eleven months i was shocked kitchenaid was no help whatsoever my husband took it apart discovered that the motor still works but the on off switch went bad however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender after years of brand loyalty i am sad to say that i will not be buying anymore kitchenaid	negative

i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it s smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies it also fits in your hand extremely well if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef s knife however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc this thing is the best tool i have ever used just wonderful	positive
i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles but mostly they ignored it when i got the battery and the bird started moving my two older cats weren t impressed but my youngest \( about 1 1 2 years \) went crazy it s pretty funny watching her with the toy she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird it s also entertaining when she s finished playing she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly which means she is hit in the backside by the bird naturally this starts the fight with the bird all over again i m pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well but even if it s just the kitten it s worth the money	positive
fiestaware rocks the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you wouldn t normally expect to go together and they usually look great	positive

i read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway i was stupid i had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months that one is great and has held up after multiple washings it is still so soft so i just didn t belive the two bad reviews i was wrong the bad reviews are correct i took these new 9 out of the box yesterday they are not of the same quality of the one i already have they are packed at least 3 different ways i think maybe some of them are someone else s defective returns i don t think these are first quality there are many snags there is at least one blue stain one looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily the quality of the construction is not good some are soft some are rough i returned all 9 do not buy	negative
i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly i feel we made a good choice	positive
i also have this fountian in black i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty the filters do not seem to last very long either i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one i do not reccommend this color at all the fountian has been fine until now but it shouldn t of broke down already	negative
i bought this set after the recent issues with teflon i did my research on all non teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may \( key word here is may \) contribute to alzheimer s \( according to some \) and the stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods both of which i am allergic too pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive a good set of a few items are 600 there are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by corning pyrex called visionware \( also known as visions \) that can be found on ebay \( and a few are left here on amazon \) as they are no longer in production finally there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternatives the items have been great so far however you will really want to do some research in google \( or any other search engine \) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really shouldn t do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water \( it will crack or break \) etc in addition you will also want to so some research on how to season them which makes them very close to being non stick \( you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and bake the pans for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit \) i did this and i just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick teflon pan but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan the downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you cannot stick the pan into the dishwasher \( and i tried it will come out a little bit rustier but the little rust does come off very easily \) the sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me so i think i will buy one more in a larger size the upsides are price no chemicals \( except for some iron \) in your food easy to care for and very non stick when seasoned this is a great starter set	positive
i ordered 6 thinking i was getting 6 washcloths little did i know that they were two to a package and i got 12 what a special surprise these are the thickest washcloths i have ever had including those i paid a bundle for at exclusive stores i am so happy with them every time i use them they have never faded or left lint thanks for a wonderful product	positive

i used an avocado smaller than the tool so i had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it d fit then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell it made me realize that it s not that hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife oh well	negative
i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i couldn t use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that s all	negative
i got this pan because i ve been coveting all clad when reading reviews of high end cookware and because of the low price i figured that the low price made it a teaser something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line it s a nice pan but limited on the good side it s hefty has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove heats evenly and holds the heat it is not non stick so i use it when i want the contents to produce the fabled brown bits that come up with deglazing stuff sticks unless you use a lot of fat as noted by other reviewers it does not have a pouring spout the rim is squared off so the pouring stream tends to be very wide my other major gripe is that it does not have a lid all clad lids are pricey like everything else in their line i sometimes use a cheap tempered glass lid with it i still covet all clad pans but not as much as i did before	positive
there s nothing worse than having to find space for and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop and because she s on the countertop you will use her she works great will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling i tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me she poaches four eggs perfectly and here you can use jumbos if you like the water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done adding more or less water the next time will take care of that actually the first time i poached jumbos i found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste i added a bit more water to the cooker plugged her back in and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute when the water evaporates she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing \( as i am \) i love this cooker first one i have ever owned and because she looks cute sitting on the counter i don t forget i have her therefore she gets used alot	positive

i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it s trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding	negative

my mother had a set of franciscan apple dinnerware as i was growing up though i never thought too much about what i was eating off of at the time later as a wife and mother myself i was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen we had just moved to appleton wi \( 16 years ago \) so i decided to use an apple theme w o even connecting the idea with my mom s dishes i was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the franciscan dishes over the years i ve collected innumerable apple items but my goal is to have a set of franciscan apple dishes of my own they do chip but they last forever and retain their color beautifully	positive

evidently the people at krups didn t try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market the caraffe is hard to take out and put back in it scrapes the lid every time they say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer you need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee you never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups i m sure this is the last krup s product i will buy	negative

i have owned this type of product for years and it works very well this review is to warn others to think twice about ordering it from amazon they shipped the first one damaged then the replacement for the damaged one was much worse than the first one very frustrating and time wasting think about it its a plastic product that if not shipped packed properly is going to be damaged and will likely leak water i have ordered many things from amazon for many years and this is the worst result i have seen needless to say i am getting a refund and buying from another retailer	negative
this is not even a toy do not waste your money on this item amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a quick machine nothing about this machine functions well never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches amazon should not carry this item it has lowered the quality of amazon s products in my view	negative
a few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall it works like new probably not a perfect vacuum but works well parts are available if you need them not a top of the line but neither is the price at 60 70 with free shipping	positive

this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk	negative

seriously for as good as their mixers are their knives are really really disappointing flimsy dull easily bent and broken within the first week of use our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later the steak knives are now following suit and the handle of the chef s knife has completely seperated from the blade gah don t waste your money	negative
one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i d much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there s no washing machine that s also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i didn t hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it s difficult to push and feels like it s gripping to the floor it doesn t fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it s big fat part vacuum head and when you re finished it s a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you re supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you ve finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i don t review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i m hoping that they will one day	negative

i have watched emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter i just dismissed it as part of emeril s shtick until i bought this machine for myself the first time i tried to use it with any liquid ingredients \( making mayonnaise \) it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl the top is just flawed in its design as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl i suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that ka did much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews \( e g consumer reports and cook s illustrated \) in any case this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry \( they blow through the badly designed joint as well \) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter the outside of the bowl the bottom of the machine and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do i will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the cuisinart i have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard	negative
i got this for our 3 year old daughter s room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night i wouldn t rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room the top and back do get hot although you d have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned bumping into it should not cause any burns i haven t noticed any odors or noises from it	positive
i was shopping in a gift store today and came across this tovolo tea infuser and it is brillant if you don t use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain this will spoil you it stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it doesn t drip on anything and the whole thing is dishwasher safe i paid more than 9 95 for mine too	positive

this swissmar fondue set is excellent i love how stylish it is i looked on amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do cheeses broths for meat chocolate flexibility is what i was looking for the 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with when done with that course remove the ceramic bowl pour the water out of the copper pot and put in your broth although i haven t used it for chocolate yet i m sure it will work well for that using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir of course if you re into the tradition of swiss fondue cooking the thick part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest the burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another i have used also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course you will need to refill it between cheese and broth of course make sure it s extinguished and cool before doing so i used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store an excellent purchase i am very happy with it	positive

great pot i m annoyed at having to press the unlock button everytime the one that prevents accidental spills the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes i m used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differences i m also really annoyed at the shipping bought through amazon it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in which wasn t up for the rigors of shipping but honestly i can t tell if the gaping crowbar looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no	positive
this is the worst pan i have ever had we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap 1st the silicone smell was horrible 2nd the pan warped in oven i used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th the muffins did not come out i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck i will never buy silicone anything don t waiste your money	negative
i purchased this bonjour frother to replace my old aerolatte frother the difference between the two brands is startling the bonjour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually over froths the milk this causes the bubbles to keep breaking down i can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won t last long on the othe hand the aerolatte frothers \( also widely available with several models on amazon \) uses more of an open metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create i m buying another aerolatte and will use the bonjour wand for things that don t need thick foam \( like mixing salad dressing \)	negative

the written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5 yr old vornado models that are the best electric heaters i ve ever had the vh2 has major flaws it s single fan speed is way too fast causing heated air to be cool cold within 10 ft of the heater the fan cannot be slowed down the thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals thereby wasting energy i believe finally the thermostat is set so that when at the highest \( hottest \) setting it doesn t allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees f i ve had the heater 1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as i have an alternative brand in my home	negative
i just got this waffle maker and have already made a perfect batch of honey wheat blueberry waffles i can t believe how easy it was and how fat and fluffy they came out i used krusteez mix because i was out of eggs and used frozen blueberries the mix told me to add a little oil for waffles the booklet told me to plug it in and wait for the green light i sprayed it with pam i poured in 1 2 cup of the mix on each side added blueberries to the top closed it flipped it and that was it the booklet says they are done when the steam stops they were brown before the steam stopped so i pulled them out no sticking no spills i almost purchased an 80 00 model but decided to get this one after seeing all of the reviews what a great deal	positive

if you read between the lines on the other reviews here i think you ll see that everyone thinks this thing is junk and their right no matter how small the job it won t do it it s just one more made in china piece of junk that i ve wasted money on it won t suck anything off hard wood or carpet floors i don t get how any company let alone a well known vacuum company could sell such a usless tool my only question is how could anyone give this thing two or more stars	negative
i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel let s be realistic these knives are cheap they re thin and they re not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that s what you re getting i hand washed these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and didn t hear back i finally got their address \( from the post office \) and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them \( with 15 minute wait times for each call \) to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i m going to finish my sentence so their rep would stop talking they won t refund my money in fact they won t refund anyone s money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they ll send me another set of soon to be rusty knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can	negative

i bought these for a wonderful craft i was expecting them to be decent but i did not expect them to be as nice as they were if i realized how nice they were then i would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping i realize that i got 100 bags but my craft took about 75 of them they are nicer than the piping icing bags that i used while i was learning cake decorating when these are gone i will definitely order more the plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out	positive
aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the 4 setting it s pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it s warmed up \( keep it closed \) i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do sure they occasionally stick and i don t always get the batter in right and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it s on but this isn t a 100 device it s just a nice little waffle maker	positive
it is very light and worm i love it definitely worth the price	positive
first off this machine looks great but unfortunately that s where the attraction ends you see i too used a little krups 45 espresso machine for years but it was a heck of a lot easier to use and made consistently better espresso cappucinno than this dog here s a brief synopsis the reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days i m constantly refilling it after making an espresso the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end making a mess of the whole machine the steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam the lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion and positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome did i mention the thing leaks now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino it doesn t	negative

this is wonderful i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me i actually enjoy working with this the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer but using really good litter and not too much of it stops that i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this	positive
why oh why did i buy this useless thing i have a perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13 inch screen which does what it is supposed to do namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners walls and floor is it perfect no but it definitely does most of the job which is what i can t say about the tovolo it has three fatal flaws first the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off i had to use one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid hot hot hot as i tried to wedge the handle under the screen s lip with my other hand second count the number of air holes in the silicone screen then count the holes in the metal mesh of the cuisipro or its ilk the purpose of a screen is to catch the grease and this is the important part to allow the steam to escape otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food i first tried using the tovolo to saute ground beef the beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen third too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat in all fairness the mesh type bows also but not as much possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable this product imo is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version save your money and buy the old fashioned kind	negative
ok this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds not minutes also it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil really its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge stupid stupid stupid design the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together its like a rubics cube a true waste of 40 bucks don t buy this it doesn t even look very cool	negative
the original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms this replacement filter however does not seem to wick water very well it can barely keep a 17x12 room at 30 humidity with the door closed windows shut and heat turned off and it s in the 40s not even very cold out in fact it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank i have to flip the filter every hour or so i called hamilton beach but they said it wasn t their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3m of course this is the only filter offered for use with this unit	negative
do your banana s turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them this used to be a huge problem in my house but now that i have the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger this is no longer an issue i hang my bananas up the moment i get home from the grocery store they think they are still on the tree out in the wild silly bananas green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer once i got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger is compact and doesn t take up much counter space which is a definite plus and it s almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display	positive

having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan as the tittle says pay the 3 4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead i m using the preseasoned more because it is just ready keep in mind its large and heavy careful in your sink coming from stainless steel and converted over to calphalon \( mostly bought all pieces from amazon com \) if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me heat kills everything if you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water salt scrubbing and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with but we all pay for convience and these pans i use mostly to sear meat with a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives get the preseasoned	positive

i wanted a dual coffee espresso maker thinking i would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence but i was totally surprised how easy it is to use and now it s lattes every day also there was almost no learning curve my first cup \( surprisingly from what i ve read elsewhere \) was near perfect and apparently it wasn t a fluke if there is any drawback it s only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe \( but i m sure a purist would scoff at such a notion \) if i have one recommendation it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe \( or whatever it s called \) to steam your milk i m not a physicist so i m not sure why but it does make a difference in summation this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice \( i give it 4 stars instead of 5 because i have to grind the beans and it didn t include an intravenous unit \)	positive

what a failure seemed just right for a simple way to make a quick single brewed cup of coffee small low profile and uses little space on the counter the science is so simple and established that i figured there could be no problems wrong it cannot deliver more than 6 ounces of water through the system even though the water well holds 12 ounces if you drink more than six ounces \( smaller than a juice glass \) of coffee this is not the unit for you the well is filled with 12 ounces and the machine starts to brew good then about half way through the process \( very slow \) it simply stops i used my own 12oz mug which fits well but the pot seems pooped and just keeps on heating the water without delivering it through the plumbing i have plunged the small water hole in the bottom if the well with no results i ve tried it five times wasting coffee and time and it simply doesn t want to work i m planning to use it for a planter small cut wildflowers will look nice for coffee i m going to a real working product it doesn t pay to return this item because the time and postage will make it too expensive this is junk pure and simple	negative

have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers london broil steaks it produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use the cooking grate can only be set at two levels standing on its posts or inverted lying on the rim of the firebox the level must be chosen before you start cooking which presents a problem for some preparations the damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature emptying ash is a bit awkward as you need to remove the doors and coal grate then lift and tip the firebox which is heavy the lip catches some ash so it is difficult to completely empty be sure to set the grill on a pan as grease will leak through and collect around the legs	positive

i was originally going to buy clickclack \( made in new zealand \) storage containers to save money i bought these \( china made \) containers instead and it was a big mistake the first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers the soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed the clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks the final straw came when i dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off rendering the container useless for airtight storage and that s assuming that the somewhat loose fitting lids actually make the containers airtight if you want containers like these spend the money on clickclack or some other quality brand i m surprised target sells these at all	negative
let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25 year old woman who isn t really big on doing chores i got a dyson for christmas and just tried out the dusting brush last week my immediate reaction was this is genius it is great for dusting computers televisions lampshades bookcases \( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices so normal dusting never seemed to help \) the tops of books cd organizers ceiling fan blades metal bedframes i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment and it works beautifully this attachment will not disappoint trust me it s already made my life so much easier and cleaner	positive
the detector was simple enough to use although it required alot of batteries \( 8 \) but the results were mixed urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances even in areas where i knew there had been an accident it was difficult to spot the difference all in all i generally wouldn t recommend this \( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom \)	negative

it doesn t zap the yap of our newly adopted pomeranian mix although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it but it didn t slow her down much we did everything according to directions and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact we have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well i m disappointed with this bark collar though	negative
i bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs it works for a while then stops working or just goes on warm they replaced it three times everytime it went out this seems to be common with cheap rice cookers see the reviews on the rival rcs 200 they all go out within days or weeks i guess black and decker and rival used the same chinaman to design these useless things i can t understand why amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do not work the companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately in frustration i bought the aroma 60 cupper for 125 and after two months that also went out any suggestions on a 20 cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated	negative
after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso \( and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines \) i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it my main concern was how hot the coffee would be and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee i ve read reviews about the noise it makes and after having the deloghi product the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all we are very happy with it buy it you ll be happy too	positive
we bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months i thought if i upgraded a bit i could get a bit more milege out of it like maybe 2 years but now with only 5 months of usage suddenly no power totally dead it is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center aren t too outrageous we ll try that route other wise looks like another waste of money i have to say that while it did work we enjoyed it it was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven and made great bacon in the warmer a bonus we weren t expecting update to this review i sent in to warranty center and they replaced it with a new one it took a while and then they sent the wrong item \( same name different product honest mistake \) but were very very nice when i called and sent the right one out right away now just hoping this one lasts more than 5 months	negative

i baked six loaves in this machine i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don t turn out just right my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time \( 70 minutes \) my loaves were only marginally acceptable they were not sufficiently baked i was using a nearly whole wheat recipe the machine was quiet strong and had a lot of bells and whistles but with only partially baked bread i had to return it to amazon amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back and were quick enough with the refund	negative

i purchased a krups thermal replacement pot for an electric coffee maker about two weeks after i bought it i made coffee one morning only to discover the coffee running all over the floor for no apparent reason the glass inside of the thermal pot had completely shattered i will be returning the pot this week	negative
i bought this coffee maker with great faith in the krups name willing to order online without the touch factor i was sorely disappointed while the concept seems promising the actual product is a failure the carafe is awkward and you have to fiddle with it every time to pour your coffee and the handle simply came off after just 6 months of normal use \( a m coffee only \) and there is no way to fix it as the bolts are lodged inside and can t be accessed an expensive mistake and to think i d looked to krups to solve my problem of having to replace coffee makers every six months or so don t waste your money and i personally will avoid the krups brand from now on	negative
i just love this garlic roaster it roasts up to 3 med size bulbs of garlic in less than 30 min i like the idea of a mini roaster so i do not have to heat up my convection oven for such a small quanity of garlic it is easy to clean and has great appeal in the kitchen it has an automatic light and lets you know when roasting is complete it cooks to perfection while lightly roasting the garlic \( top facing down \) and i like to use a cloth to handle the hot garlic and squeeze them into my mashed potatoes if you allow the garlic to cool off the cloves firm up and are great eaten with a desert fork i use spanish roja garlic in this roaster and it comes out perfect every time i have used this machine for 5 months now and have since purchased another one as a gift	positive

we recently moved and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment one cat usually friendly and playful would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment the other cat usually very docile was being overly aggressive during play time with the other cat and with us after buying the comfort zone plug in we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal more friendly and playful less anxious and aggressive the only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug in vial will last 4 weeks but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3 but maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left it is hard to judge when the plug in actually ran out because the cats behavior did not change even after i unplugged the diffuser	positive

the cheaper ones don t quite fit unfortunate because these are so expensive which is why i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars i would give five for the product but the price really is outrageous they know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers \( hamilton beach not amazon \) too bad the makers of these machines don t have the users in mind instead of their bank accounts they take advantage of people who need these humidifiers	positive

what an awesome product heavy duty and sturdy you d never know it was an assemble at home item it s a quality piece of furniture it s on wheels which is a good thing because it is surprisingly heavy let s start at the top the butcher block top it s three inches thick and as such it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart it is made of fine high quality asian hardwoods the finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil the next is the cart itself immediately under the butcher block top there is a 2 deep drawer it s large and deep enough to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice the pull handle on the drawer is fashioned out of brushed chrome beneath the drawer there is a shelf surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods adding a modern look matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors the pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish the cabinet is large enough to hold an entire set of dinnerware \( as in my case where i have eight place settings that include dinner and luncheon plates fruit and soup bowls and more \) finally heavy duty professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing the two in the front are locking to prevent stubbed toes the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit the easy to follow directions for assembly \( which are diagrammed and in english \) call only for a philips screwdriver a hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts i used an electric screwdriver for both the philips screws \( 14 in all \) and the hex bolts \( after i found the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver \) i can happily report that all pieces fit together easily \( no struggling to match up this piece with that piece \) and all holes are pre drilled the drawer requires assembly also the runners for the drawer are already attached you must put together the front sides and back of the drawer with screws \( again all holes are pre drilled \) a word of advice regarding assembling the drawer follow the directions where it says to put the screws in only halfway before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer i made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble sliding the bottom into the assembled front back and sides it s a snug fit once i loosened the screws enough the bottom easily popped into place and i was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws i have only one other thing to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright you must lift the butcher block and set it down on the top of the cart at this point you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart and they re pointing upward these screws will fit into four pre drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block you must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart because the butcher block is so heavy you may want to have help but what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture it ended up being ikea sells a similar item for twice the money i give the home styles double door kitchen cart with butcher block top 5 stars because of the beauty of the product and its better than a bargain price	positive

i am a very experienced user of innova innova is i guess you can say is the parent company of ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware innova is not know for quality and this product is no different there is a 25 year warranty on the ultrex i had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off you can return the product for another but yes you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized you have to pay ups or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge the customer service is not world class i had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement the workmanship is horrible the product is made in china however i ve had other things made in china that were of great quality so i don t know what is up with innova i suggest that if you find a product made by innova avoid it save yourself the aggrevation this product doesn t deserve 1 star	negative
i bought this sauce pan last week the quality is very good the handle design is quite comfortable i tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan i found no hot spot it responded to the change in the heat setting is average it s kind of heavier than all clad ltd for the same size of pan i m not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet for the initial impression this calphalon one non stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as all clad ltd stainless steel mc2 look for the bargain it s worth the cost	positive

after reading the other reviews i almost reconsidered my purchase however the juicer works great as long as you follow a few tips 1 \) make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on tight check once then check again 2 \) don t use the paper filters particularly if you are juicing in quantity once i threw mine in the trash the balancing issues went away immediately it makes clean up a little harder but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use it s not a big deal 3 \) if the item being juiced won t go through be patient and pulse push it in don t cram it with the pusher my only concern is that when you juice quantities so much pulp sticks to the side it s hard for all of the juice out to strain out it s best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice using the above tips i expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time	positive
in the twentieth century and before cast iron pans had the size stamped on them which told you the diameter of the cooking surface twenty five years ago i bought the lodge 10sk which is a 12 skillet with a 10 inside cooking diameter ok with this skillet marked 14sk the inside cooking surface is only 12 and it should be marked 12sk they deceptively flared out the sides to get an overall top diameter of 15 1 4 as a selling point this isn t very helpful to my pork chops being 36 less space than i thought i was buying i d watch out for the 10sk too i guess to get a real 14 cast iron skillet i need to get a griswold hilditch ps it weighs 10 lbs	negative

not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust it is really useful on those thick pizzas like spinach and feta plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board i almost never use it for any non pizza cooking and a heavy sharp knife works almost as well however it s a fun item and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza i definitely recommend it	positive
we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand \( they are made like hotel china essentially homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line \) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave they are both great never been disappointed with fiestaware	positive

to us typical fiestaware pieces have great design color durability and functioning wrapped up all in one we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with straight candle results even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product specifically the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform a kind of softer look in the color application around the rims on plates for example and the piece will still look beautiful we don t want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces	negative

do not be tricked into buying an easy sharpener they do not work spend the same money \( or less \) on a good stone set that has various angles \( i e lansky w 17 20 25 and 30 degree angles and 3 5 stones use 20 degrees for your slicing and paring knives and 25 degrees for you chefs \) i opted for the stone set \( i m a bit of a purist \) but i ve heard good remarks about the diamond set too the 3 grit set is all you really need coarse medium and fine get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such with proper care and light steel use \( it s the re aligning tool not the sharpening device be gentle \) you ll probably only need to touch up your edge once every year or two depending on the work load you put on your knife but if you do seriously muck the edge up you ll have a system that can repair your knife to good as new condition my chef fell onto the tile floor point first and i had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later the normal touch up takes less than 5 minutes per blade and at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened you ll be ahead of the game after the first use hint use a 5x magnifying glass loupe to inspect your edge by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source you ll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened you can also take a look at your edge before using the steel and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel and see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives i admit i have a couple myself in short get stoned not taken	negative
i bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers i did not succeed i paid 50 and could have bought a 20 mr coffee and saved myself a lot of my money this is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features it has no clock no timer no automatic turnoff \( it will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off it is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back it is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles you are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing in a word don t it just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element and it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee i am not an engineer just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go this coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace if you want a basic coffeemaker get a mr coffee for 20 this is not what you are looking for there is nothing deluxe about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me	negative

2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn t require you to have seen the original i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out and having never seen the original i thought i would be lost and wouldn t enjoy myself as much as other people but on the contrary i left the experience much happier than when i came in this film is full of quick one liners that deserve a laugh the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open i have heard and read that people didn t appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races but overall i think the balance works well even thinking of the plot that we are left with i really can t see another time when a race would even be appropriate and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original i would have to disagree why frankly i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor \( i mean c mon have you seen the pacifier \) he s nothing more than a meat head who while able to do pretty good fight scenes should leave the dialogue to someone else yes this film is for the younger crowd and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place \( take the boat jumping as an example \) but there is no saying that an older person wouldn t enjoy it as well the only thing that i will say is that you really shouldn t go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance or else you will be disappointed if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is however you will thoroughly enjoy yourself	positive
don t buy the directors cut badder santa is absolutely hysterical for some strange reason the director decided to make a director s cut that is a neutered version of badder santa i bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from billy bob in the first scene was missing the celebration in the bar after the first mall heist where billy bob proclaims he s giving up drinking was missing the next scene where billy bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing that was enough for me i immediately shut it off and best buy agreed to let me swap it for badder santa due to the false impression of a longer and fuller cut than it s predecessor as is the industry standard i was duped please buy badder santa instead this is a watered down walmart version of a classic not an extended cut	negative

not a fan of graphic novels or cgi i was fully prepared to dislike this movie but found it to be so well written cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection it s a dark movie subversive really but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people that one strong person with a will determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them can turn the tide it s a powerful message and it s beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery symbolism and script bravo	positive

the casting here was excellent ben stiller elle macpherson sarah jessica parker were all great in fact i am convinced that elle macpherson can act because of the 3 movies i have now seen her in she plays decidedly different people in each one she is perfectly cast as joe s dream woman i found eric schaeffer s character the least appealing of the whole cast some of the jokes here are wildly funny the audience is never given a clue that the jane lindquist character is only getting involved with joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her i thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually but was not interested in a relationship with him earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants that part did not make sense this could have been improved by some better writing and better character development the humor here is what makes this worth watching	positive
this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it what a waste	negative

when the lead character acts like she s sleepwalking through the entire film that s distracting when just about anyone from my high school s drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth then it s time to open up the wallet and hire better talent once you get past the special affects all which use cheesy models this godforsaken movie is boring as sin or should i say mud beside being preposterous for example the meteroid or whatever only hits a dam in its first strike this pitiful film is also delusional remember the scene where the head of fema risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire as hurricane katrinia proves there is no such thing as a bureaucratic administrator hero instead this movie comes off as a piece of not so subtle federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time	negative
good lord but this was awful normally a e makes a mean costume drama but benedict arnold stank like rotting poultry the dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo mo to cover up the lack of extras and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap halloween shop \( with the exception of the military uniforms especially the continentals which were accurate \) aidan quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used historical voice \( the lame semi british accent affected by actors in costume drama \) kelsey grammer was pretty darn good as washington but his lines were horrid horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade school history text worst of all were the simpering john andre and peggy arnold whose rose garden courtship scene was laughably bad in short don t even bother to rent this it s an hour and a half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house or napping	negative
i have been waiting to see this film for a while now and i just finally saw it i m very dissapointed this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills the film sucks the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat and get stranded on a deserted isolated island was a great idea except that with this film you re going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi s make up looks silly they re not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh the picture quality has aged even if it s dvd format very grainy poor picture quality i have seen other movies from the 1970 s on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it s age but this was awful the only good thing it has was decent acting lol like i said before this is nothing but a \( low budget cheap horror film \) rent it if you like but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time	negative

this out of all the many versions of jane eyre has to be my least favorite granted samantha morton has a very adorable fairy elfin like face like mr rochesters description of her but her acting has no highs and lows she stands up to mr edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers seemingly no respect to her employer which is not fault of hers the writing of the script is bad and so the direction ciaran hinds is totally over the top he is so angry with no understanding his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed he is not at all like the character described in brontes epic book of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the innocence and singular personality of earnest honest and yet strong sweet jane eyre that charlotte bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words the over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical to me there is no love feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust he seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl and she though supposedy a virgin she dosn t act like one plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story especially during janes childhood i do also miss the gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the dalton clarke mini series which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story if you want to see great versions i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version that movie truly captured the spirit and feel it is moody dark and mysterious another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story dalton s and clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime however if you are like me see them all and make your own decision they all have something to offer and most are entertaining	negative
i had never watched this film before ordering it so i took the chance it turned out to be a smart buy as usual peck is just awesome he seems to fit this role well as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man as the movie continues you realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level i enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film overall this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer so if you are considering purchasing this dvd i d suggest you buy it you ll enjoy it	positive
okay after reading several reviews i decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs boy did i get my moneys worth it was so incredibly bad that i was first cringing in horror before i started laughing the characters especially hiei were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing now i m a die hard yyh fan but i give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch put me in a good mood for the rest of the day if you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i d definitely suggest buying for th he11 of it	positive
the only reason i gave this dvd set 2 stars instead of the 5 that i would rate the show itself is because there are absolutely no extras on this dvd set no featurettes no cast interviews not even any episode commentaries while i appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner i d prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes	negative
for better or worse after the relative box office slump of on her majesty s secret service producers brocolli and saltzman decided to woo sean connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum connery who had said he would never do another bond film donated all of his money to his own foundation while his performance is competent and smooth as ever he seems all business no longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant connery mechanically works his way through diamonds are forever an outright bore of the bond series and in my opinion one of the worst \( certainly connery s worst \) while some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the bond genre it plainly isn t it was an attempt to return bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers far from trying to lampoon the bond formula the producers were trying to resuscitate it and they failed after the opening gun barrel sequence we quickly find bond on a personal mission to kill blofeld once and for all after the death of bond s only true wife \( discounting the false marriage in you only live twice \) in on her majesty s secret service \( at least this is what we must assume since no mention of the marriage is made in diamonds are forever \) bond catches blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and after a couple of struggles with both blofeld and a duplicate bond drowns blofeld in a vat of mud it is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence the titles involves various diamonds slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women all set to the title song sung by shirley bassey \( who also sang the goldfinger title \) the plot of diamonds are forever is quite strange in an opening similar to goldfinger we learn that large quantities of south african diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet surprisingly have not made their way to the market worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation disguised as peter franks bond quickly succeeds meeting up with tiffany case \( jill st john \) an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of bond s identity bond s mission is almost compromised from the start when the real peter franks makes an entrance forcing bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in from russia with love after a smuggling attempt goes awry \( thanks to bond \) bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating it turns out that blofeld is behind it all \( bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser \) blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on earth blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse willard whyte \( jimmy dean \) whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world and using whyte s resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in america russia and china the purpose blofeld is organizing an international auction offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder will bond be able to stop him in time diamonds are forever feels like a film that was stitched together rather poorly from a myriad of interesting elements one feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order the infiltration of a smuggling ring the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator the quirky and gay hitmen mr wint \( bruce glover \) and mr kidd \( putter smith \) a not so subtle rendition of the famous las vegas recluse howard hughes a fight on an oil rig et cetera all of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right but the combination doesn t yield what the producers were hoping for what is it about this film that feels so ridiculous one of the major problems in my opinion is situating bond in las vegas bond in america is dull his class wit and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of las vegas in the 1970s bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations not to a strip club furthermore the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series i think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd the chase is boring the buggy looks ridiculous and prop esque and there is no suspense the climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring sure we have a big set and big explosions but there is no cutting edge stuff here connery as mentioned looks very tired here tiffany case is a bit refreshing but quickly becomes dim witted and dull and the bond girl with the clever name plenty o toole \( lana wood \) is only in the film for all of five minutes blofeld is now played by charles gray who first made his appearance as bond s japan contact in you only live twice gray s performance takes blofeld back to the ridiculousness of you only live twice even appearing in drag at one point there isn t much more to say the acting is dead in diamonds are forever now some have tried to defend diamonds are forever by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the bond genre after producing six bond films the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move bond into the roger moore pun fest the series would eventually become while this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film it seems plainly false if you watch the making of documentary on the ultimate edition it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real bond flick and not a parody the producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box office success they were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the bond formula anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization this film stinks let s get over it ultimately i think you should skip diamonds are forever the only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order it is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between sean connery and roger moore the ultimate edition does have crisp picture and sound if you must struggle through the film make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable but if you only desire to watch the better bond films skip it diamonds may be forever but this film died a long time ago	negative
there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama revenge films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end whilst the victim or top billed actor actress comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed the lines could have been written the night before and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic the violins would always shrill around kiefer and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement no frills nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end where did eye for an eye go wrong i don t think i need to count all the ways for you but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic what was sally field s job i know that is a small detail but it better highlights my complaint that our central family \( the mccanns \) were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed ed harris literally walked through his character proving that field s husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion the only character worth watching and was developed briefly was kiefer he was 100 evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end yet we didn t even know that much about him either \( which upset me \) schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably didn t even need to read the script and the story played it safe from the beginning but it wasn t what i wanted to see i expected film like this to come out during the 80s not in 1996 it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris sally field phillip baker hall keith david and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan nothing stood out in this film nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it and nothing made me feel excited about these actors this was a literal nothing film it lent nothing to the cinematic world except \( and i stress this a bit \) another peg in a very tired genre known as the revenge thriller after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements which made me think of a high school drama production it was amateur at best but she said that is why directors use sally because she is known for being overly dramatic this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly sally saw success with it once but as she continues it only creates bad cinema there were times during sally s bigger speeches that i found myself laughing i couldn t help myself but her focus on certain words and clich reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn t have to play the outlaying father any further in films he was completely wasted in this film was there any emotion with him i didn t see any then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes also did mantegna take a class on how to be a one dimensional clich urg his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one dimensional police officers again the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself field over dramatized the entire film thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel but alas ole safe schlesinger didn t take us down that darker path i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast yet we chose to stay on the lighted path that coupled with the poor acting just created a film that didn t catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world overall in case it wasn t obvious this wasn t a good movie at all in fact i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the revenge thrill fell into that same pattern the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure this film did not sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight while everyone else was forgettable the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil watch this film for kiefer but nothing else skip it grade

i unfortunately wound up seeing this christmas misgiving on its original airing i have always been a fan of any christmas special since rudolph hit the air way back when each holiday season i hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the new rudolph this is so far away from that you would need the hubble space scope in order to see how close it came the imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise regrettably the story makes santa vs the martins look like an oscar contender such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3d gimmickry you can t improve on failure after it aired on tv i didn t see it return in later years on regular tv i didn t miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely can t win them all	negative
the freshman is a very funny movie the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed matthew broderick is the freshman an innocent nyu film student who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his family the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild bad words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families	positive
it takes an hbcu graduate to write about the hbcu experience period just look at a different world and how bad the first season was debbie allen \( a howard grad i believe \) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed so it s no surprise that spike lee the morehouse man would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin i m not saying that you had to attend an hbcu to understand school daze but you had to have attended one to get the real flavor of what it was like and you have to have an open mind any hbcu alum saying that this film wasn t realistic is flat out lying yes it hit on some things that the old folks call dirty laundry \( such as hazing color issues those who think that getting an education makes you white and so on \) but those things are real at hbcus yes even today \( major props to spike for having that one dark skinned sista in the gamma rays isn t that always the way \) and there are no good people or bad people spike leaves that decision up to you julian had his good points \( his intelligence leadership and pride in his town school etc \) and dap had his bad points \( his blatant bigotry and bullying \) and both of them had legitimate points one thing spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis no offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a pwc but in my experience at a predominately white high school i noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike they particpated in a more destroying from within kind of system and grew wide eyed and offended when confronted even with solid proof \( i would never spread rumors about you sleep with your boyfriend steal your term paper \) black students on the other hand will take anyone head on whether that person is the school president captain of the football team the richest kid on campus crippled doesn t matter your status doesn t count if you go to an hbcu i had a friend who saw sd and said that is so unrealistic since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time she graduated from the university of texas enough said i m so grateful for this film and its realistic portrayal of black hbcu students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare and that people only go to hbcus because they can t get into a real college i wouldn t trade my experience at florida a m university for a degree at any pwc rattlers	positive

my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons unlike some of the other be s with random visuals here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons and no i didn t care for the commercial either	positive

if you are looking for a dvd that is filled with white stripes music and interviews look elsewhere the item description says it has over 40 minutes of in depth interviews but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes \( if that \) of this is actually with the band \( and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd \) it has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the white stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning it is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details but it is not something i will watch again \( if jack meg were telling their own story that would be worth it \)	negative
i m not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the season 1 2 box sets which is how you re better off seeing them \( at least they re in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes \) instead i will be focusing on the bonus features not the violent femmes music video because that too can be found on the season 1 box set but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features i love the interviews and the in studio voice recording re enactments but i hate how every piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame you can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen and even then it isn t clear as there s a bubble shine over it i d love for paramount nick to include all of the original non bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2	negative

i saw this thai horror film about 3 years ago i have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from thailand and i have seen a fair share of them \( nang nak the sisters mae nak art of the devil series \) the film focuses on tun and his girlfriend jane tun a photographer reunites with his old friends on the way home they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them ok i am not spoiling anything the story is more complex than it sounds tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them with jane caught in the middle as usual there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people shutter refers to his camera and what it represents sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones i m stopping here i don t want to give out anymore the plot is not that complex but believe me when i say the film is well made it does a great job of putting things together each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present i didn t see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric creepy feel to it also there is a scene in the movie that tun and jane looked at actual photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid honestly this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the shock ending has the greatest twist of any horror flick i ve seen i ve seen a lot of horror films only the exorcist and the omen ever scared creeped me out and shutter came very close my female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place since i haven t seen the tartan release and i only own the region 3 dts es rlease from panmedia \( hong kong \) but tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the hong kong or korean versions the video is sufficient with some dark and bright contrast it is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel the dts soundtrack is great though very crisp and loud the english subtitles are excellent the thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen a definite must see if you are a fan of asian horror or horror films in general it rivals ringu one missed call and the original ju on 1 and 2 four and 1 2 stars	positive
the cutting edge is one of those break out feel good movies you can watch anytime and it s still as much fun today as the first time i saw it in 1992 doug dorsey played with verve by d b sweeney is a rising hockey star with a bright future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level it s not long before doug is noticed by skating coach anton pamchenko roy dotrice an affable personality whom the audience gravitates to from the start pamchenko brings mr dorsey to the estate of kate moseley moira kelly a would have been gold medalist at the 1984 winter games in sarajevo she blamed her former partner for their loss and never fully recovered you see kate has an acerbic tongue that s as sharp as her blades she has issues welcoming a new partner and doug is no exeception the two meet and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice sessions doug isn t used to figure skates and kate takes full advantage of this by missing serveral connections in the routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice each time he falls kate skates by teasing him uttering toe pick one of my favorite scenes in the movie doug is made of quite stern stuff and soon turns the tables on kate in a harmless way during an impromtu hockey game played on her private indoor rink having ironed out the roughness the two become quite polished and a budding romance ensues between them the question is do they have what it takes to become 1988 olympic champions in pairs figure skating the acting is charming and the soundtrack first rate i would have given it five stars except for the ending which i won t give away here buy the dvd cd you won t be dissappointed	positive
the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie its pretty good itself where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo dorin gray mina harker the invisible man dr jeckyl mr hyde allan quatermain tom sawyer all in the same movie about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors the only real drawback is the length about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes all in all a good popcorn flick	positive
i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most over the top performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans close up after close up conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not so famous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you re under arrest they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino s colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior don t waste your money or on line rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too	negative

rip it off is not an easy film to watch in short it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line leaving only the most attentive viewer \( read myself \) to guess at what was going to happen next but not in a good way judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well known and talented personalities as alyson hannigan and jennifer esposito it begs the question why did you do this film or on a personal note why did i buy this film especially at 22 and change frankly i bought it because of alyson hannigan she s gorgeous obviously intelligent and the girl can act individually speaking she does not disappoint here it s obvious that she really didn t want to sleep walk through her role as lexi and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes she is a singularly interesting actor to watch and her performance simply wants me to see her do more preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film \( see jennifer aniston in her brave performance in the good girl \) but enough gushing if ms hannigan had not been as engaged i would have trashed her soundly most everyone else in rip it off \( with the possible exception of the fellow who plays sergei with operatic relish \) is more or less phoning it in when they do their scenes this made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy also films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort beware do not adjust your screen the appearance of the film is inherently bad rip it off and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye i ve seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey and contrary to the technical description of the dvd it is presented in the horror that is full screen and not widescreen can you believe people invest money in these films \( ahem	negative

this was a film i was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects as far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment the acting was good but robin williams did not receive as much screen time as ewen mcgreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been but the major problem was the story yes it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak boring at times and just silly i would recommend ice age or garfiled the movie rather than this film	negative
it s an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by wb s attempt to unfairly empty our wallets if we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway they are in the business of making slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers products we demand or risk losing our disposable income die hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available c mon wb we love these shows and will pay for them we only ask that you don t rape our wallets give us the full season box sets much sooner	negative

i have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this even my old tapes from tv were 500 better the picture was faded the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words so looking away from the movie did not help it is also one hour long but seemed like three probably a copy of a tv movie as it also had cuts for commercials though i could not find any place that said this it was advertised as a 2 hour dvd and it is i guess but i could not see any more of it at the end of one hour it just showed credits and it was over i am returning it and it is the first copy of a dvd that i have ever returned for picture and sound quality	negative

i found the film malice to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery sure there are a lot of twist s in the film however that is what i found to be very good about this film especially the way these twist s were done there will be no spoilers in this review the film begin s with murders occuring in a small college town andy safian \( bill pullman \) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings all circumstantial moreover he is having problems with his wife \( nicole kidman \) something happens to her and she blames andy for this to tell you would give away the film it seems as if one of andy s old school friends is now a practicing surgeon \( alec baldwin \) therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief and the doctor \( balwin \) in particular who caused this grief to her but there is more to the story than meets the eye there are several stories going on at once first you have a serial killer secondly you have a distraught wife \( kidman \) blaming her ex husband and his doctor friend for what has happened to her but there is more to her than the viewer suspect s i will leave this to you to discover the film is better than the reviews warrant it is a very suspenseful film full of twists recommended	positive

i agree with the negative comments i eventually stopped watching it unconvincing acting \( and a small point that i found irritating in tv movies about war some of them have a too clean look that make a film seem unrealistic there is no dirt anywhere as far as i could see everybody looks too clean the settings look too clean and not realistic the acting level was what finally turned me off glad it was on tv	negative

robert ryan made a number of westerns during the 1950s and 60s but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre nevertheless who can forget the wild bunch or his magnificent portrayal of old man clanton in the seriously underrated hour of the gun \( with james garner \) and his self effacing determination is equally unforgettable in the day of the outlaw now one of his best roles as the straight arrow sheriff in the proud ones is on dvd and available at a very reasonable price finally the proud ones is perhaps director robert webb s finest picture combining great action scenes and plot twists taught dialogue and a superior cast that includes not only ryan but jeffrey hunter walter brennan virginia mayo and robert middleton minor roles are given attention as well especially arthur o connell \( as ryan s deputy \) and important thematically the wonderful paul burns who plays the town drunk and panhandler hunter when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff will give alms to burns at the finish of the movie just as ryan did at the beginning when he was sheriff this touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about hunter s increased maturity the proud ones is a superb movie with a great story it will repay re viewing unlike some westerns i don t tire of watching it periodically it is that good	positive

i should say up front that i have never played chess nor do i understand the game but i remember being intrigued about the film when i saw the theatrical trailer was i intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game was it the intense images of competition was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy the answer is all of the above searching for bobby fischer is an excellent family film for all i am living proof that even those who don t know jack about chess will love this movie it is a movie not just about chess but about acceptance the bond of love and friendship compassion for others and not being afraid to be who you want to be the balance of drama with edge of your seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film max pomeranc plays the young and sensitive josh waitzkin a pint sized seven year old with a cute lisp who becomes fascinated with the lower class men playing chess in a new york park he watches the men his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces he convinces his mother to go to the park with him where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman it is there that josh s mother realizes her son has a knack for chess also noticing josh is the fast talking park chess player vinnie \( a funny and great performance from laurence fishburne \) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game after a match with josh josh s father \( played by joe mantegna \) realizes his son s special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named bruce \( played by ben kingsley \) to make josh an even better chess master bruce sees a young bobby fischer in josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that bobby fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance through all the technical strategies of the game being learned josh and bruce develop a good friendship and with bruce s help combined with his own special gift josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies but there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess we ve all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child but what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents mind too much and what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you re not these are tests that run way deeper for josh waitzkin than any chess tournament josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game in his own way the insightful josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like bobby fischer did in the process josh pushes his father and teacher s feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings it s a matter of what is more important chess competition or love through it all the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear love and friendship for each other no matter what there are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain to the visit from his teacher at the chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show but amongst the competition and drama there are some nice comic scenes from vinnie s trash talking against the others in the park to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious to the humorous appearance by william h macy when he offers to get josh s dad a tuna sandwich the climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where josh takes bruce and vinnie s teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named jonathan jonathan is a boy i feel sorry for in the film playing since he was four years old all jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you especially when you cannot just be a kid the acting is terrific ben kingsley max pomeranc and joe mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film it s too bad that pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing a nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young bobby fischer talking about and playing chess with pomeranc narrating along it gives us a bit of the history of the world s greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when bobby fischer vanished enter josh waitzkin searching for bobby fischer is one of those stand up and cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well this is a movie you ll want to watch time and time again	positive
they just don t have movies like this anymore this is not a movie that makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen this is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past charlie sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war this seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie he finds out alright keith david plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role he cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked the supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here overall this is my favorite movie of all time it has stood the test of time and never fails when i want to see a good movie i just have the old special edition not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice it has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film there is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when i saw this i was mroe than glad i got the special edition you would nto believe what the actors went through it is a great making of	positive

fais moi des vacances \( we need a vacation \) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in france while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads directed and written by didier bivel \( with writing assistance from djamila djabri \) it offers a slice of life we rarely see that underbelly of france s projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods lucien \( aymen sa di \) lives with his father \( bernard blancan \) mother \( hiam abbass \) young sister pamela \( laura mas navarro \) and his tough streetwise older brother jos \( nabil el bouhairi \) in a small flat close by is his african friend adama \( ibrahim koma \) and his equally poor family of father \( makan fofana \) mother \( marie philom ne nga \) and sister fanta \( hawa yakar sissoko \) as school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation a state neither lucien nor adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury the two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a ruv of a family headed for the beach but despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van s owners the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp a fact that makes them flee upon returning home both boys families punish their activities and when lucien seeks comfort from his older brother jos beats him and tells him to grow up in the end the boys finagle their way to the beach but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re evaluating their lives the cast is uniformly strong the writing is excellent and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys imaginations it is a fine little film one deserving of a wide audience grady harp january 07	positive

this production is misleadingly named far from being a biography of grand duchess anastasia it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century s enduring mysteries a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920 s among at least some people who had had contact with the original family i do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography after all how much of a biography can one write on a 17 year old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege however i do fault this production for being a badly flawed recounting of history and i am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of romanov history buffs about whether anna anderson was really anastasia this work s take on the life of anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the romanovs their support among their subjects and their reputation among today s russians first life in the inner sanctum of nicholas s family was not the halcyon existence this production claims certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal but neither nicholas nor alexandra were well suited to their roles and they lived under the strain of it they were increasingly isolated from the extended romanov clan who shared the dawning awareness of the russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble while these forces might not have touched anastasia directly she was certainly touched by her brother s hemophilia and her mother s response of sinking into frail health chronic emotional distress and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times secondly this film s portrayal of the counter revolutionary white army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong while the whites wanted to unseat the bolshevik revolution there was virtually no support for a romanov restoration among the leadership of the white army nor are there any known attempts by the counter revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family in fact one senior white military leader once remarked having seen the monarchy at close quarters i have no desire to see its return and thirdly while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last romanov s reputation underway in russia today the notion that the murdered romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims in fact the great masses of modern russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted romanovs back on a throne i do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the romanovs whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo history that plagues serious study of the russian monarchy s fading years or whether this production did not have access to newly opened archives but whatever the reason \( s \) it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is in fact closer to a grocery store romance novel	negative

i enjoyed francis veber s the closet released in france in 2001 for two reasons first it features an all star ensemble of french acting certainly a tribute to veber s skill as a director just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits daniel auteuil fran ois pignon g rard depardieu f lix santini thierry lhermitte guillaume mich le laroque mlle bertrand michel aumont belone the neighbour jean rochefort kopel the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber s reputation his previous release 1998 s the dinner game was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece actors get attracted to that type of skill the second reason i got a kick out of watching the closet i just learned that bend it like beckham writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release with chadha at the helm her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham s runaway success so i feel like i m in on a really great secret knowing she s working on a re make	positive

this has got to be the worst film i ve ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i don t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he s sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96 but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television note s this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon and \( one of my most personal favorites \) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she s to good but why this film she \( and mila \) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this	negative

before i rate the box set and the four movies i would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films when i was really young i use to always ask my dad to rent tremors and we would all set and whatch it but when i got a bit older and i could understand things better i became afraid and was scared of grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me anyways after about two years i got the guts to whatch tremors 2 after shocks and afterwards i was agian afraid of grabiods and now shriekers attacking me finally after about ten years of not watching them me and my buddy travis got to talking about tremors and he asked me what grabiods where so i dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days i ended up creating a tremors comic so after becoming so involved with tremors again i decided to watch the first film again and after it ended i bought it off amazon and a week later i bought the third movie and then another week after that i bought the second i had literly gone a 180 from fearing tremors so long ago to become a huge fan and when the fourth finally came out i had my family my friend travis and his brother hooked now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over i can finally rate them the original tremors is by far the best with it s all star cast and great story line the second best would have to be tremors 4 the legend begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began tremors 2 after shocks would be third best since it stared earl and gummer and tremors 3 back to prefection would have to be the worst since it s story is weak its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far overall this is a great pack of all four tremors movies and if i hadn t boughten all of them aready i would buy this attack pack ps tremors 5 script has been finished and if tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth and one more thing it would be awsome if universal would release tremors the series on dvd	positive

it seems to me there s a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era i m not arguing it s either better or worse than others it just feels different and very distinctive in this light wall street reminded me vividly of no way out for instance which happens to be from 1987 as well and several de palma films don t ask me why it just does useless considerations apart wall street directed by always controversial oliver stone pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away they always burn out in a snap of fingers and bigger they are harder they fall right the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen featuring a bright young sport bud fox \( played by charlie sheen \) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life he wants more and hotshot gordon gekko \( michael douglas \) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become powerful vicious influential and a sure winner by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence bud sneaks into gekko s office and tries to prove his value to him from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average but rather well executed in this particular instance story of the young proteg who rises to the top at breakneck speed until unexpectedly something shatters his bond to the master something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie so i ll let that for you to find out if you didn t see it yet all the acting is quite superb especially the relationship between gekko and fox martin sheen who is charlie sheen s father both in real life and on the screen is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work not selling out and not letting others and yourself down he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he s on screen a couple of minutes at a time if you like high finance intrigue big guys pulling the strings on each other twists and turns then wall street is probably essential and it will probably give you an excuse to read sun tzu s the art of war	positive
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this	negative
i was very disappointed with this film the premise was really intriguing with elvis switching places with an elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at graceland leaving the real elvis to scratch out a living as what else an elvis impersonator and now at the end of the king s life he s a semi invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy since it s texas the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to stevie ray vaughn and oh yeah jfk is also in this nursing home having inexplicably been transformed into ozzie davis how can you miss with a setup like this well for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there s no real need to provide any additional comedy the movie is flat with very little humor as other reviewers have noted it moves at a glacial pace even allowing for the protagonists being 80 somethings who don t move like they used to sure the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film but there s no point in making a comdey that isn t funny nice try but booooooooooring not at all recommended	negative
i m a huge orson welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge but i hated this film i was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that i just didn t get it the photography was classic welles the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum don t get caught up in having to like it just because it s welles it s ok to go against the grain and declare to the world this movie blows	negative
julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a giant corporation in a court of law julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it i give this film 5 stars because julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times	positive
the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i ve compared the two and the first dvd had good color saturation dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now though and the image of course is higher resolution	negative

i ve never been quite a fan of music dvds by that i mean the live stuff i much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending i m there that s one side of it i m also a huuuuuge gorillaz fan and i have seen them live the show to their self titled debut but don t get me wrong that doesn t make me biased towards everything they put out on the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because i only expect the best from what they ve given with that said this has to be literally one of the best music dvds i have encountered in quite some time don t worry about extras documentaries which while would have been nice to show how it was put together are not here which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn t show you all that the show itself was amazing and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this and i recommend you have a decent audio system as well the amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well the editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another dvd to sell from start to end it will leave you speechless as you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the gorillaz you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level you can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level and to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself if you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other dvds especially now since they just released their newest one those will fill in all that nicely but even if you re not a fan or just a new convert i highly recommend you own this no matter the age or person you are \( you notice this on the dvd as well \) and regardless of what your favourite genre is because they are so massive they can t be contained into one thank you damon and jamie for such an experience mates	positive
with the phenomenal success of the poseidon adventure the first disaster movie of its kind the sequel was sure to be a hit not so a plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great having a leading lady \( sally fields \) fresh from an oscar win and a few veteran actors \( michael caine karl malden \) might also sound promising unfortunately the magic of the set production of the original is not even close instead of upside ballrooms barber shops kitchens and bathrooms the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes the rest of the cast is comprised of television actors who are as wooden as the script there s no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous you won t even laugh in disbelief irwin allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel considering the original that s a terrible shame	negative

i watched this with some trepidation and i have to say it was both better and worse than i thought it would be it was better because it remained fairly true to the original in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending it was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original and i found stone s lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting a couple of things kept me viewing this dvd one was the london setting which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns the other was sharon stone s rather plucky performance and the presence of charlotte rampling who has aged into a different kind of beauty morrisey doesn t even come close to filling michael douglas s shoes and it s hard to feel sorry for him at the end as with the first movie you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made the basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one however both movies were quick to abandon hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex there s nothing wrong with either of these things but here they just get in the way	negative

one of the best directed films of 2006 kiss kiss bang bang is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences and even though kiss kiss bang bang may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid fire dialogue or to untangle the plot one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill it s a class a tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that shane black pulls off here with kkbb s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead serious drama to gallows comedy if that seems like an easy feat well remember 1941 not even spielberg got it right but shane black nails it here and it s his directorial debut downey kilmer are also at the top of their game here but it s michelle monaghan who impresses with a flat out great performance that keeps up with the veterans sui generis \( one of a kind \) is the phrase that best describes kiss kiss bang bang although it s remarkably mainstream at times it s a showcase of talents for everyone involved and when the bullets aren t flying there s even a romantic comedy here social commentary to boot i can t think of any other film quite like it and that s just how the warner brothers tradition seems to work \( at its best \)	positive
in this film made in uk and luxembourg madeline stowe stars as senga senga and her daughter nat are driving at midnight after visiting nat s father they bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult and we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood why they do so is never explained and even at this point when senga is trying to rescue nat she still acts like a brat the last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion and becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating i assigned that good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction not the wirtting the movie is dark and suspenseful though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie it does keep you on the edge of the seat as senga tries to rescue her daughter	negative
this edition of the film sucks and sucks again the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended each shot was carefully composed \( and not intended to be butchered \) this edition is a travesty especially when it s purported to be put out by fans do you re homework there are also scenes missing from this print scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts instead its just sloppy and self indulgent look for the earlier laser disc edition as for the extras do we really need the it s great because i used it in my video slop and it s great because i did a bad homage rip off slop the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that s what was great about it then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image strikes me a total scumminess all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted by a few lazy lard asses with a quick fix mentality	negative
i have always had a morbid fascination with that segment of the population that believes that the bible is the only book one has to read and that great literature consists entirely of the left behind series i bought this movie to get a sense of this group banal is the kindest word i can find for this tripe third rate actors low rent science fiction backdrops and completely out of touch with reality the movie opens with the israeli agricultural miracle what it does not tell the audience is that israel would be a dead state if it were not for the 20 of the israeli government s budget funded by us taxpayers through the us government s very unwise investment in this apartheid regime \( see jimmy carter s new book \) and if it were not for the blatant israeli underground pipes that are literally looting the arab aquifers at long range and from way beneath the earth israeli agriculture is not a miracle it is a travesty it consumes 50 of all the water used in israel and produces less than 5 of the gross domestic product the movie goes downhill from there just to place it in a proper religous movie context if the ten commandments was a perfect 10 this movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a 2	negative

jackie chan and chris tucker deliver once again in this follow up to their great film rush hour this film follows on the premise of the first with a bit of a reversal this time tucker is the fish out of water in chan s hong kong as with my review of rush hour i ll say up front that if youre looking for anything more than a fun filled actioner then this movie wont please you it breaks no new ground and the plot is quite formulaic but if you re looking for deep drama and character development what are you doing watching a chris tucker movie watch for a great cameo by don cheadle as a black man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a chinese soul food restaurant in a black section of los angeles that alone is worth a laugh there is another stand out cameo by jeremy piven as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple be sure to watch the end credits and catch all of piven s ad libbed outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor but then as with all jackie chan films half the fun is watching the flubs during the end credits	positive
based on a true story and a book called evidence of love this tv movie is made remarkable by the emmy winning performance of barbara hershey she is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex lover s wife in a self defensive rage hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage brian dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament the movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for ms hershey s dynamic presence	positive
i have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the mask is no exception i would also have to say that the mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films there are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but i think the one thing that shines the most about the mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it for those of you who don t know a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old tex avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress \( this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd \) these kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes getting back on the subject what i also found thrilling about the mask is how well the dog milo was trained to perform certain task if you have seen this movie you know what i m talking about the training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd the movie itself was a take off of the comic series of the mask though not quite as dark as the comics the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi violence so that the mask would not be deemed as a children s film hence the pg 13 rating a big plus to the mask was how jim carrey portrayed the different character traits of stanley ipkis and stanley ipkis wearing the mask another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask and of course who can dislike ben stein s typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks oh and cameron diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well as for the dvd this re release is an improvement from the previous you get 5 1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture the added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie	positive

ridiculous plot one dimensional cardboard like acting \( especially leon lai s rigid dead like fish out of water performance \) incoherent dialogs horrible editing and directing every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline nothing deep but shallow all the way just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves long sleeves and black cloak even the white pigeons turned out to be dead nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat nothing at all curtain call drop it sooner than later	negative
while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times the genius of david bowie shines through as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust it was an amazing look at the time period the sound quality is suprisingly good although some camera angles are distracting at times it was also neat to hear bowie s pronouncement of this is our last tour ever little did he know this dvd is worth every penny rock on	positive
synopsis \( including ending \) don ameche \( gino \) a chicago shoe shine man is approached by the mafia to go to jail for 3 to 5 years to take the place of their mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him they ll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat joe mantegna \( jerry \) takes don ameche \( gino \) on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he s incarcerated joe mantegna is on probation from the mob after disobeying orders from a previous job joe mantegna goes outside channels to take don ameche \( gino \) to lake tahoe to the galaxy hotel where they stay wine and dine and try to have a good time things turn difficult when a local real mafia boss brings don ameche \( gino \) to his house as a guest and they form a bond the real mafia boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and don ameche and joe mantegna are caught in the middle they escape the gathering and on the day don ameche is brought back to chicago joe mantegna is ordered to kill don ameche and make it look like a suicide it s cleaner this way he s told joe mantegna refuses the order and the film ends with a mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life the good joe mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real mafia boss in lake tahoe other than that there s nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge the bad the mob wants tough guys right this is a comedy right no ones a tough guy and there s no laughs joe mantegna plays a sissy instead of a mafia tough guy don ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality i wanted to like this film but i coulden t because it was very slow very boring and none of the characters were interesting we never have a scene with the real mafia boss that looks like don amecha and the two never meet you would expect a friendly thanks for going to jail for 3 to 5 years for me but it doesn t happen at the end someone for the mob is dressed up like the real mafia boss and he s testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail he doesn t look anything like don ameche or the real mafia boss and yet he s right there taking the fall if the film didn t need to depend on don ameche s appearance why didn t they send him to jail from the beginning the worst david mamet experience i ve had very surprising stinker the characters if don ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting if joe mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them he would have been more interesting as the film stands they re both flat don ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used when a character says something you can be sure don ameche repeats it 30 minutes later like a senile robot don ameche s dialogue leaves a lot to be desired add to that his boring and stale acting in this film he played very dumb not interesting like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money overall joe mantegna was not believable as a mafia hired hand don ameche was too passive and uninteresting and joe mantegna is too passive and stale scene criticism a couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic \( gas station scene where joe mantegna is given 3 more in gas than he asked for \) joe mantegna is working for the mob and he asks for 1 of gas and gets 4 he doesn t have the cash to pay and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is please please please a real mob guy would punch the gas attendant take back the keys and leave for the plane they were late for a mob guy that won t defend himself for 3 \( scene with don ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years \) don ameche doesn t put up a fight or try to leave the room and is too passive we don t learn about his past or his life or family there s not enough time spent on the offer and the scene was over valued for it s lasting value \( bedroom scene with joe mantegna trying to let don ameche escape \) joe mantegna had no real connection to don ameche s character to justify the scene instead it s 2 strangers personal commentary the test for a comedy for me is how many times did i laugh this film never made me laugh i m shocked the film costs 24 99 on dvd rent it instead it belongs in the 1 bin at wal mart writing criticism lines like he s the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy and lines like a big man knows the value of a small coin and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense the writing is drivel alternative recommended film trading places with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy and also don ameche albeit in a smaller role	negative

at last a full length jimmy buffett concert on dvd it s been a while coming but this is a beauty there are so many highlights it s hard to know where to start perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the dvd the sound is superb the camera work spot on and the real essence of a jimmy buffett concert is captured perfectly the song mix is terrific everything from buffett classics like volcano to new classic like piece of work to iconic covers like southern cross seeing jimmy and the coral reefers perform in daylight and night time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a buffett concert is such an all encompassing experience for me a favourite moment is the concert finale of steve goodman s city of new orleans steve now resides under home plate at wrigley and i m sure he was singing along as well buffett fans and new parrotheads alike will find this dvd one to watch many times over	positive
why on earth am i giving this movie five stars its plot is minimal the script has words and phrases i ve never heard and i m not sure were ever really used in the real world and to top that off it s more than a little unbelievable however despite all of the possible downsides i really enjoyed it honestly i m normally not into these kinds of films but it was just good fun the humor wasn t disgusting and gross the chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable \( even if i don t ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario \) and there wasn t some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat all in all it was just a fun movie to watch and it s been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face	positive

this is a review of the dvd not the world series please save your comments re the series for the sports blogs in this day and age for major league baseball to produce a non anamorphic dvd is absolutely pathetic this dvd was made for a widescreen tv \( 16 9 ratio \) but cannot take advantage of it because it is non anamorphic meaning it will not take up the full widescreen it has black bars on all four sides they may as well have made it full screen instead with a 4 3 ratio also in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the dvd out quickly they decided not to include footage from the season to show nothing of the tigers play off run and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players \( gee was it exciting to be out on the mound \) i am an avid cardinals fan but this dvd was not worth the 14 99 i paid for it major league baseball as usual cheats its fans another lesson they fail to learn from pro football	negative
this is the dumbest most predictable horrible waste of time i ve ever ever seen this movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn t it took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that s supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe drink and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us after watching this movie i felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash my only hope is that our european friends didn t seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident	negative
there is nothing in this dvd that wasn t in the book in fact stan and john basically read the book to you as they show you the pictures from the book i was hoping to actually see the artists do the drawings but there is maybe 60 seconds total of footage of actual drawing the rest of the video is just john buscema tracing over all the images that are already in the book if you really want to learn to draw comics this isn t for you if you just want a basic overview of the process this dvd might not be too disappointing but if you already own the book definitely don t waste your money it would be cheaper just to have your mom read the book to you	negative
this was the word used by one reviewer and it just about sums up the film another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto biographical and introspective pieces of work usually these are binned as the person matures asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well heeled to let her have her way on film instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority but good art is more than self expression self promotion self pity and self indulgence it should have a satisfying underlying form say something new to its audience expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know especially if it s told in a semi familiar way most of what asia says in this film we do already know if we are half aware of what goes on around us still the girl has a cute face and she s put a lot of effort into this performance something more may come with time	negative
big trouble has a lot of big things going for it big laughs big plot big cast and because of all this it loses a peg or two for there s just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself you get somewhat lost in the jumble the film stars tim allen in the central role if you could call it that as a journalist who gets himself and his son \( foster \) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals \( sizemore knocksville \) a hitman \( farina \) a wealthy jerk off of a man \( tucci \) the mans wife \( russo \) her daughter \( zooey \) a homeless man that resembles jesus \( lee in a histerical role \) some mobsters dimwitt cops \( garofalo warburton \) fbi agents with attitude \( heavy d epps \) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva see all that and i haven t even got to the plot but it s one of those things you d have to see to really understand lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly does that sum it up it s funny real funny but it s also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace keeping you watching closly to understand all that s going on it ll mae sense in the end though i promise	positive
disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full length feature film snow white and the seven dwarves ironically given this early success snow white was their only hit movie for the next 13 years world war ii kicked the hell out of disney s overseas markets even movies today regarded as classic disney pinnochio bambi fantasia lost money on initial release disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the us government and the south american films that were part of fdr s good neighbor policy etc stuff that made back its costs but not much more by 1948 disney was in dire financial straits they had just enough money for one more movie walt disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn t survive and it would have to be what they did best a full length animated feature film walt said to himself what we need is a movie about a girl in trouble audiences love that they loved snow white that s what he wanted a movie like snow white but even more so more comedy more drama more magic more music more lovable characters he chose as the basis of his company s hail mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world cinderella disney didn t have the money as they had on earlier films to lavishly storyboard every scene thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action then the animators used stills from that as storyboards the photos used survive to this day and many are provided as a special edition extra in some cases these photos have the animator s drawings over them turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in cinderella s family chateau in 1950 cinderella was released and was everything disney so desperately needed even today cinderella is arguably the best movie disney s ever made it s just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film the animation artwork was a product of disney s famous nine old men at that time not yet old cinderella pulls off superbly something not particularly easy to do it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work from eric larson and marc davis beautiful and graceful cinderella to ward kimball s wonderful jaq and gus gus the mice and over the top lucifer the cat everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural part of walt disney s plan to out snow white snow white with cinderella involved its music he very consciously wanted cinderella to be a source of hit songs there had been hit songs from disney films before \( heigh ho and whistle while you work from snow white when you wish upon a star from pinnochio etc \) but they d been almost accidental oh we have a hit song well that s nice for cinderella disney for the first time went to tin pan alley \( 28th street in new york city where the professional songwriters could be found \) disney wanted his girl s music done by the very best craftsmen the guys who wrote hit songs for a living the cinderella soundtrack hit big \( a 1 album with 3 4 million units sold \) with songs even today considered quintessential disney most notably a dream is a wish your heart makes from the movie s opening scene the work song while the animals help cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown and bibbidi bobbidi boo \( nominated for an academy award as best movie song of the year \) from the fairy godmother transformation scene for their best movie disney apparently spared no expense producing the dvd not only has the picture quality been digitally restored but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5 1 surround sound mix totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies \( cinderella has the distinction of being the noisiest movie ever restored according to its audio crew \) the original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists a word about the movie s aspect ratio \( i e how wide the picture is compared to its height \) the dvd cover says cinderella is presented in its original full screen aspect ratio \( 1 33 1 \) this is untrue virtually all sound films until 1953 including cinderella were 1 37 1 since a tv screen is 1 33 1 you don t lose a lot when the original is formatted to fit your television i just wish they hadn t lied about it cinderella ends at breakneck pace we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to happily ever after bing bang boom walt disney believed audiences like a happy ending but they don t like a happy ending that goes on too long hey who am i to argue well maybe i ll argue a dvd extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used one of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding cinderella is taken by the grand duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes the first time prince charming sees her since the ball she s not wearing a lovely gown she s wearing her scullery maid outfit cinderella is frightened how will he react when he realizes she s not a fine lady but a poor servant girl and of course he doesn t care how she s dressed he loves her anyway i can see that scene in my mind it would have worked beautifully this is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better	positive
i mean that statement in two ways first in my humble opinion this is martin scorcese at his finest this is better than goodfellas by a wide margin all of the regulars give awesome performances in this \( even sharon stone who i can t stand \) if you like mafia pictures this is the best one to own i also mean that it s a great picture due to the fact that it s on hd dvd the picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of las vegas really jump out of the television it s almost 3 d the extras are ample but i d say adequate that s the reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 there is the obligitory commentary deleted scenes and a couple featurettes it s all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae i do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running this and batman begins are the reasons you should own an hd dvd player note i have the hd dvd drive attached to my xbox 360 and it works brilliantly	positive

this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year old who aspires to be a mass murderer there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino s kill bill films his salute to the genre or reservoir dogs which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence bullet is little more than two hours of broken glass fire blood squirts amputation beatings and explosions this makes gladiator look like a sunday school picnic the characters are totally flat one dimensional there is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc the acting is weak static despite the fact that i don t understand a word of cantonese we are presented with a series of stereotypes \( the hooker with a heart of gold the good friend the crazy friend and the bad friend \) unfortunately the american stereotype of the viet cong as madmen and saigon as hopelessly corrupt is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of viet nam during the american occupation the worst thing is that because they are so shallow and undeveloped you don t care what happens to the characters so i ll tell you and then you won t have to finish watching the film they kill each other my advice skip it	negative

but the movie was pretty good i found myself highly disappointed in the book and almost wasn t able to finish it the characters were flat the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages and not a true story so i wasn t sure what to make of the movie i was pleasantly surprised though to enjoy the movie immensely it was long but it kept the pace going throughout the subtitling in the latin and french was a bit mundane to drudge through but it made the movie a bit more believable than everyone speaking english when the main character is actually french teabing was played brilliantly and while hanks was not who i would have thought for langdon he did a superb job in the role if you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense it is well worth watching murder mystery suspense action drama it s all there in this film	positive

well this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get unfortunately the female teenage protagonist \( played by witherspoon whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here \) acts masculine and heroic the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point the girl runs around acting like a commando a veritable one gal army blowing up the bad guys while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal s backpack as they cross a desert the gal snaps at him bella abzug style and walks quickly ahead leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course in the real world the result for such manly girls once they become women is that men do not choose them and they remain alone and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men of course in this movie the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy masculine gal but that s why they call them movies when are these post modern writers artists and other culture shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them not compete with them men crave femininity in females not feminism wow is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie instead of craven and flippant he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual type with a wild boy haircut if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she s still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside down gender relations uh another problem with this movie and there are many is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert something which should be and for a time is here depicted as a foreboding and life threatening task yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog and we see the boy s flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out of place manner considering the dire situation they are in the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light hearted inane scenes look i dig disney kid movies more realistic ones you know old style disney movies you take old yeller for example now there was a quality kid movie and quite true to life this movie was not it had a plastic spoiled american materialistic teenybopper feel throughout disney has gone down the tubes in any number of ways they ve been subverted by radical marxist agendas \( note one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion something called tapping while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un pc judeo christian religion this is bias folks leftwing pc bias same as the aforementioned feminist bilge \) i am learning to run not walk away from disney stuff and this movie was further cause for me to do so	negative

i read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives a lively debate there were so many brilliant things said about the film that i found myself passing out helpful votes \( to both positive blisteringly negative reviews \) like they were candy the movie is an evocative work of art i encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view i agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers but i will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned the dvd cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers a sort of blue lagoon from the renaissance it is not it is misleading i concede a \) the story is probably not historically accurate b \) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition c \) tossi was probably inconsiderate conceited and immoral but the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters having said that i do object that the movie according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available is not just inaccurate but oppositional to what probably occurred therefore i critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person the movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional \( or incorrect \) causal factors and those cause effect relationships don t seem to ring true having said that i agree with some of richard burt s review comments that historical accuracy may still be subject to interpretation it is reasonable that artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial \( defending her freedom and reputation \) than she might have been with tassi personally and it seems too easy to just paint tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done there is usually more complexity and diverse conflicting interests in most people especially artists one strong objection near the end of the film artemisia says no one dies of sorrow while there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment the line frustrated me people do die of sorrow my limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest most sensitive artistic and caring people i ve encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow and the people i have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow not selfish controlling or passive aggressive sorrow but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations often unidentified misunderstood misconceptions sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit character the soul creativity sorrow is not incidental sorrow can destroy health or as the angel of america in angels in america says the body is the garden of the soul sorrow is worth full attention the movie tries to examine the effect of artemisia s loyalties to her father and her teacher the screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply good or bad both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on artemesia her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression they work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts at the same time they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices privacy and pacing beyond her desired level of influence artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father s drive and design at the same time she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in in polite society may your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find and may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties compare caravaggio s judith beheading holofernes to artemisia s version of the same painting her version is more violent realistic \( less idealized in posing dirtiness lighting etc \) her version has the female servant actively helping judith artemisia s paintings show a palpable understanding of hate violence sexuality compassion artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best that s why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions	negative
having visited st petersburg russia a year ago i could not pass up the chance to watch this movie i must say it was nicely done i can relate to the obnoxious business like brother who happily did not go with me on my trip i was more like the care free younger brother but not quite so care free as the character protrayed the scenery was awesome all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie although i wish there were more because the city is full of beauty and this goes for the women as well i mainly went to see the city but i also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that i planned would be my travel companion what i didn t expect was to really fall in love \) the big reason why i confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to american women as if explained in the additional extras on the dvd but the russian lady that i met there and the culture of her up bringing quickly changed my way of thinking one thing i should add though the movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself such is not the case it takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here expect at least 8 months but it is more like a year it is time consuming to get her a us visa but she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover the wait is worthwhile another word of caution prepare yourself to fall in love with russia the people are very nice and i know of a lot of americans who go there quite often to visit and re visit some even live there now	positive
i had two choices watching this movie smile or laugh out loud when i wasn t smiling i was laughing keaton s the general is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered the story line is simple but what keaton does with it is genius johnny gray \( buster keaton \) is an engineer for the western and atlantic railroad he has two loves his engine the general and annabelle lee \( marion mack \) a fine southern belle when war starts johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected he s more valuable to the south as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier trouble is nobody tells him why he was rejected worse annabelle thinks he may be a coward and tells him she doesn t want to see him again until he is in uniform just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the general and take it north destroying bridges and lines along the way while a northern army moves south unknowingly annabelle lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped johnny sees the general chugging away and races after it determined to bring back the general when he realizes annabelle lee is held captive his resolve knows to bounds for the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest fastest funniest chase movies ever filmed keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point and when he rescues annabelle and realizes how hopeless her southern belle helplessness can be his exasperation is matched only by his love the general features a big cast a major battle fleeing armies a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge keaton s timing and inventiveness are legendary so is his risk taking he does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous in one he is lying back on the engine s cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward in the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks keaton has another railroad tie in his hands at the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as keaton on the cow catcher passes this scene has no cutting the two ties fly off as high as keaton s head he could have been killed instead we laugh it s amazing that in his older years keaton could still walk his body took incredible punishment for the laughs try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties his ingenuity is extraordinary how do you build excitement out of an extended train chase both engines are behemoths and are on the same track they can t pass each other keaton does it with endless bits of business in fact he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split second timing what makes keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn t do double takes he barely reacts but he s no stone face keaton s characters are simply very serious fellows things happen to them his characters don t react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions this edition of the general comes from kino video and looks good it includes two keaton short films the playhouse \( 1921 \) and cops \( 1922 \) in the playhouse keaton portrays all the members of the cast orchestra and audience in a stage show including nine members of a minstrel act the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp in cops he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another	positive
the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst josh hartnett kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline this film is directed by sofia coppola \( lost in translation \) i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola doesn t mean you belong in the same category as best director of all time sometimes magic does not stirke twice how can all five sisters end up killing themselves their homelife wasn t that unbearable a lot of parents are religious but that doesn t mean you ll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide kristen dunst just gets on my nerves her acting is the same in every film don t believe the hype the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking poetic film	negative
based on bizet s tragic spanish opera this was rita hayworth s first film made by her production company beckworth \( derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter rebecca \) she decided on her close friend and favorite leading man glenn ford as don jose to her carmen the results are far better than some reviews would have you believe the glorious lush techincolor is fabulous \( studio bound as most of the sets may be \) while hayworth s unforgettable screen presence dancing and bewitching beauty and the heat generated between her and ford makes this movie memorable the sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have \( complete with putting her finger to his lips \) sparkles with sensual static granted ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform \( after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his bandit clothing he appears much more relaxed \) if it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the columbia classics collection so should affair in trinidad another hayworth ford collaboration it s just great to look at flaws aside if you adore rita and glenn even in a tempestuous volatile romance this movie will provide that for you was there ever a more enticing tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love	positive

francisco was right this film is about as well conceived as buttcrust the review on the back of the dvd says jaw dropping but the full quote probably reads jaw dropping \( because i was lulled to sleep like a baby \) there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage in the zombie attack scenes but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie the rest of this film consists of the ear bleeding whines and yawn inducing infighting of the human characters ill conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo cynical and extremely redundant evil side of human nature message that would be better left to jean renoir \( or even adam sandler considering the results here \) i don t watch zombie movies for the characters especially characters so vapid and unengaging it seemed like the script writer read a novice s how to pamphlet and said yeah it needs some conflict if these characters weren t so constipated and bloated i d give them a chance one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of social commentary but that s just a mindless knee jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully it wasn t you d get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass the critical ambitions of this movie are ill fitting and embarassing and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director s real talent which is \( you guessed it \) the lovely undead the rest is monotonous dreck i don t know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man s dramatic rags all that aside the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop out in the history of horror movies a horror movie that sucks for 3 4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself but the cut away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads sorry but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite repeating moron	negative
this is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations this film s strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them sean connery plays captain marko ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film tim curry is amusing as the dutiful dr petrov in a role well suited for him the rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of sean connery and tim curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film alec baldwin as jack ryan james earl jones as admiral james greer sam neill as captain vasily borodin scott glenn as commander bart mancuso richard jordan as dr jeffrey pelt and an impressive peter firth as political officer ivan putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story this was probably one of alec baldwin s best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of jack ryan should have been portrayed baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of jack ryan embodied sam neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country s political dictates and ambitions sam neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly i liked scott glenn s character immensely as the us commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him the list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film their efforts make this film a great political action adventure and emotional drama	positive
tim burton offers the most charmingly off beat yet visually sumptuous movies in hollywood from his stop animation work \( the corpse bride \) to dark romances \( edward scissorhands \) to horror \( sleepy hollow \) burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably all the right notes are there but some are played just off key enough to create the thrill of tension perhaps no other director was so suited to film roald dahl s most famous work charlie and the chocolate factory and remain true to the author s vision most people associate the tamer goofy willie wonka and the chocolate factory starring gene wilder with dahl s tale but forget that dahl had a healthy streak of lemony snicket sensibility to him so it is perfect that burton makes a darker more dangerous film for all to enjoy the visuals in charlie are astounding the chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate \( not the icky brown water of willie wonka \) and the squirrel nut sorting room is a classic of mind blowing set design and that is not all oh no that is not all possibly the most visually stunning element in charlie is willie wonka himself played by burton favorite johnny depp depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them and one wonders what inspired depp s quirky nervous mean spirited selfish concoction depp plays wonka as tight as he plays jack sparrow loose and he never misses a note but whereas gene wilder s willie wonka was more genial puppetmaster depp s wonka has a sadistic streak in him perhaps instilled by his dentist father this is a great if much maligned performance the most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly drug inspired presence of the oompa loompas wonka s army of diminutive henchmen in the wilder film the oompa loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy oompa loompa do be de do tune in this version all the oompa loompas are played by the same character \( even though there are hundreds of them \) and their dance numbers are even more fantastic however the songs don t have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest indeed there are several lyrics that i just couldn t catch in this film version and that is a pretty major quibble far from a feel good movie but definitely a good movie charlie and the chocolate factory deserves to be seen and for fans of artistic visions studied	positive
a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70 s and mid 80 s allen got his name on the directorial map w this piece of fluff you gotta start somewhere tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later real comedies than an original film in its own right allen s early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so bad they re fun movies	negative

this movie is very simple and unique it s the kind of love story which you really believe in while you re watching because it doesn t feel phony this can be credited to the acting the situation and the plot as well this isn t about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her that s all been done and that s what makes this film a breath of fresh air river phoenix shows why he is missed by so many and really allows you to connect with his character i recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art and be touched at the same time	positive
im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with ice t mcginly s films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast \( which included hacks like paul rudd \) was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and ice t who have graced some of his previous work please sean stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff leave that to idiots like capra wenders scorcese etc they are not in your league	negative

this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen it takes colossal gall \( to say nothing of immense bad taste \) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella tack on every possible bodice ripper cliche in movies then try to interweave dostoevsky s own personal travails as narrative interstices all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original the acting is strictly mid 20th century nyah ha ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn i got this just to see the great luise rainer now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed	negative

weird whacked out interpretation of lewis carroll s alice in wonderland that combines live action with some stop action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape white rabbit is a sawdust stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the taxidermy stand caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and glass eyes mad hatter is a marionette and march hare is a wind up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye devoted alice fans may have a different reaction but i found jan svankmajer s alice disturbing and at times tedious everyday objects the stuff in alice s room become the stuff of the dream playing cards become red queen and entourage the white rabbit has a nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed his sawdust guts alice herself becomes her own blank faced doll there s no law that says alice has to be bright and cuddly but it sure helps whether intentional or not svankmajer s alice is grim and nightmarish svankmajer animates figures in motion real figures like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such but he doesn t animate facial expressions combine that with the flat tone of voice by the film s narrator alice is narrated by the actress who plays alice dubbed into english or course and the film has a flat dead feeling the film oddly enough for an animated feature is leadenly paced some scenes seem to run on forever the tea party with the mad hatter \( a marionette \) and the march hare \( a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly ill attached button eye \) runs on and on the animation repeating itself way past our limit of patience the mad hatter wants a new cup of tea \( change chairs \) the march hare scoots around in a wheelchair the new seats are taken the tea is poured the mad hatter wants a news cup of tea \( change chair \) and on and on and on sheesh thought that scene would never end look i m not that big a fan of carroll s alice stories in the first place but the movie adaptations of his stories be they disney s animated movie or the 1933 full length feature with ned sparks as the catepillar and sterling holloway as the frog all have had something going for them comedy for one thing svankmajer s inspiration is laudable but his execution is often disappointing his alice is dark grim humorless and not everyone s cup of chai it s like listening to a quiet sonata played by an acid jazz band it s familiar enough probably good enough for the converted but hard for the uninitiated to embrace and unlikely to win any new fans	negative

i ve had the opportunity to watch the movie stealth over the past week it was on tv here otherwise i don t think i would have watched it my instincts would have been correct an action technothriller stealth has a predictable plot a new elite team of 3 good looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots including a disrespect for authority mayhem ensues people die the leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence and they work together to save the female pilot who s gone down in north korea the plot direction and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads \( josh lucas jessica biel jamie foxx \) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart i m sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads and came away disappointed me i was expecting little so i guess my expectations were met though i will say i was amused by the last line	negative

when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each husband killing wife after wife a man who enjoys murder and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it if you don t heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny \( i wouldn t take it for free \)	negative

23 for the chinese version and the english subtitles are mad the english subtitles available on american cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable i don t regret this purchase because i think drama sets should be 25 tops and the camera is so clear on this dvd compared to what is seen on american cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are it made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for me when i didn t really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable so what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series i don t get the appeal of this show at all i thought it was really slow my favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise i felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk breath in breathe out and ponder ponder i think the phenomenon of the show s popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring just thinking about this show strips another layer of elasticity from my heart it s so boring p s this drama got a 20 rating domestically but sam soon and jang geum scored 50 hahaha	negative

i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it s year of release 1986 prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of purple rain both the film and the soundtrack and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal which is what they did to prince in those days many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip they couldn t believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn t trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy of course poor critical response alone doesn t usually keep the public from making a movie popular yet under the cherry moon was a bomb at he box office probably the main reason for this is that the movie although shot in color was released in black and white for some unfathomable reason the general movie going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black and white movie now don t get me wrong i m not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves i m only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color i will acknowledge that this movie s target audience is prince fans since i am one myself and have been most of my life i m not the most entirely objective viewer but i make no apologies for my love of this movie it s not a guilty pleasure for me because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release and unfotunately i missed it in theaters \( i couldn t get anyone to take me i was only 12 and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents though my dad went with me a few years later to see grafitti bridge on opening night but that s for another review \) but since it s dvd release in 2004 this has become one of my most watched discs in my collection the soundtrack is killer the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever there s even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn t make the album \( some of which was issued on 12 vinyl \) plus i think the movie looks great the cinematographer was michael ballhaus who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit \( and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics \) i wonder how the movie would feel in color but i do think black and white was the right way to go even though the movie is set in then contemporary times it has the feel of something from the 30s there are so many classic moments in this movie i won t try to list them all but here are a few christopher tracy \( prince \) giving his bela lugosi eyes tricky \( jerome benton \) tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery the wreka stow scene the car race between christopher and mary sharon \( kristen scott thomas \) as for the acting i ve heard a lot of people saying that prince s performance was no good i don t see much truth in that claim after being so serious in purple rain it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side \( as in purple rain \) i m surprised jerome hasn t done much additional acting outside of prince movies and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this her first major role to become an oscar nominated highly repected leading lady how is the dvd presentation pretty good for such a largely overlooked movie the widescreen transfer and 2 0 stereo mix aren t anything phenomenal but get the job done nonetheless the movie looks and sounds fine as for features anyone expecting a full blown special edition like the 2 disc purple rain will be disappointed but at least it s not a completely bare bones release four music videos are included though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio visual quality \( though they are passable i would ve preferred 5 1 mixes \) the highlight is the live performance of anotherlover which was taken from a never released \( at least not domestically not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u s \) concert video documenting the parade tour mtv held an interesting \( i e very weird \) contest to determine where under the cherry moon would have it s world premiere the ten thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere which would be held in their hometown mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party and unlike the premiere of purple rain unfortunately this program is not to be found on under the cherry moon s dvd release lisa barber was the contest winner and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan wyoming a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan prince summed it up with a single word purple	positive

i didn t enjoy the film i also didn t enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i don t consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what s the difference it s king lear a downer of a play there s nothing great about ran just as there s nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he s wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him why because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare s king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he s an annoyance	negative

this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer	positive

mortal kombat annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters \( odd considering that in interviews after the first movie all of them said they d want be willing to come back for a sequel \) to the horrible \( even by 1997 standards \) cg effects to the cliched fight scenes \( gee two women in a mud pit i bet it took them all night to come up with that one \) virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat 3 video game \( and set immediately after the first movie which while not great looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger \) the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan \( played by brian thompson the alien bounty hunter from the x files \) and his army \( shown in most scenes as a small band of extras oooh scary \) as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity with only a week to do anything about it lord raiden \( played by james remar replacing the and i can t believe i m saying this much better christopher lambert in the role \) once again enlists the help of liu kang \( robin shou \) sonia blade \( sandra hess \) and princess kitana \( talisa soto \) along with help from a select few other characters from the video games crowded lineup to prevent this from happening the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad however given the film s obviously low budget the weak screenplay the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film and most jarringly direction even more inept than that of paul w s anderson it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high only to have practically everything come crashing down the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie as well as music by kmfdm megadeth rammstein juno reactor and others if ever you re looking to punish yourself for something then by all means watch this movie however if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself you will avoid this movie like the plague believe me you ll thank yourself later	negative
i have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968 granted that version is marvelous i have bought both versions and love them both ok it is difficult not to compare when watching but i can t help wondering if this version would have been the first i or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version if people would have been complaining about that version i can have different versions of vivaldi s four seasons can t i actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all \( and i do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other \) we would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version would we i have gone to the opera numerous times and watched don giovanni three times every time with different performers remake absolutely not i think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it because is such a great play so logically this would not be a remake why can t we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other \( splendid 1968 \) version when doing so that done i must say i understand why alais is in love with king henry patrick stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses very well he is a very good match to close s queen i did not care for richard i thought he was not commanding enough bit whiny i think john is a difficult part to play to say the least and i didn t care for him either too much the idiot geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good king philippe too much a boy although he has moments when the interaction with king henry makes him interesting alais good enough which of the versions do i prefer that is difficult i have highly enjoyed both i think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of hepburn and i prefer her to close this version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic \( alais and henry \) approach i definitely prefer stewart to o toole who seemed too young for the role i liked the way stewart made us see henry s self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming \( that is until the end when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart \) o toole had a very serious approach all the time on the other hand anthony hopkins and timothy dalton were both splendid i think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast which of the versions i watch depends on the mood i am in i think they are both good in their own way	positive
what can a single lie do that is the question that is examined in lillian hellman s the children s hour martha \( shirley maclaine \) and karen \( audrey hepburn \) run a small boarding school in a small new england town karen is engaged to a local doctor \( james garner \) when karen punishes a malicious student the little girl decides to get revenge the way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by martha s aunt \( miriam hopkins \) to complicate matters she blackmails another girl \( veronica cartwright \) into confirming the story this lie immediately destroys the martha and karen s school but their life s are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected but when the lie exposed it is too little too late when the play opened in the late 50 s it was daring and very controversial when the film opened in 1961 it was still controversial but 40 years later it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an oscar nomination if she hadn t made breakfast at tiffany s that year shirley maclaine was fresh off her success in the apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs she proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy but it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role \( the turning point \) fay bainter and miriam hopkins were major character actors in the 30 s and 40 s and were given one final chance to show what they had left bainter received an oscar nomination for this film william wyler had nothing to prove in the 60 s yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles this was another triumph for him dvd extras none	positive

this is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of america in fact the real star of the show asie from the ubiquitous red ford taurus is the scenery of america itself the camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene but the point of the series is to give a reader s digest view of places people can visit but excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series each trip is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral family vacations combined into a one hour program this is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm	positive

this has a run down of the colts season from game one to the super bowl thats it do not expect the super bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is very disappointing the afc championship game of the week is just a post game show i would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game it was better then the super bowl the only good things where the few extras with manning and harrison wired for sound i hope there is a better one come n cause this is not worth much	negative
a french saying goes the more things change the more they stay the same it appears that the historical epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that poetic license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith s emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth firstly we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina secondly the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to purify the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is preserve the aryan race modern science using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60 000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well like it or not we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie yes this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks every single good thing about this movie would have been discovered invented with or without d w eventually and very probably very soon after every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later talented directors of the time the overall lies attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie s great hall of fame they say that racists are not born but bred this is why i m not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here his father was considered a hero of the confederate army where he served as a colonel i m sure as a bitter loser of the great war he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it s quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn s overtures over and over again in conclusion the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it s okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors world view also do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that s longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message like i said before none of the techniques that this film claims to have discovered are earth shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good d w griffith s legacy mess	negative

the last american virgin was literally one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and that s saying a lot it s not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom the writing was terrible the acting was terrible the direction was terrible the pacing was terrible the jokes were god awful etc even the girls weren t really that attractive \( with the huge 80s hair and bad fashion \) i mean what the hell was that fat ugly dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie and even more perplexing why was our hero trying to lay her and why was our hero best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with they would be at each other s throats in one scene and then best friends in the next i would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again i guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs they played whip it twice shake it up at least three times and at last count just once like five times when once was certainly enough songs that i didn t know at the beginning of the movie i knew by heart word for word by the end to top it all off this movie had one of the worst most disastrous endings i ve ever seen i can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt coming of age drama but when you re doing a mindless teen sex comedy you don t end on a downer and depress the audience after all the hell our hero goes through he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin and then without any follow up or warning the credits start rolling i was like what the hell the only great thing about the movie is that i had a ball paying mst3k only no one was around to appreciate my witty sardonic remarks so i ll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure on arguing with your best friend over the love of your life hey i stalked her first on sparking up a romance with said girl remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile didn t that mean anything to you on declaring your love for said girl i ve loved you ever since i destroyed your bike just so you d talk to me on major operations not that big a deal real line \( referring to the girl s upcoming abortion \) hey it happens all the time it s not that big a deal my line yeah it s a simple coat hanger procedure \( and later \) real line i know dozens of girls who ve done it my line i ve helped all the gals in the neighborhood they call me dr abortion on nerds at parties man there s nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw aww yeah on fat girls inconsistent characterizations of real line you know i have to be home by a quarter to 12 \( a minute later \) you said you had drugs where are they my line i have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me so fu k me in the a and let s do some blow before they come home on choose your mate carefully \( as our heroes scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous older woman \) nothing s funnier than getting gonorrhea eh folks skip this dreck and rent fast times at ridgemont high instead at least that one had phoebe cates	negative

house 1 is darker than it s sequels but stll maintains the horror comedy feel throughout don t expect to be blown away by outlandish hollywood special effects the majority of the special effects are not special but if you can get over that you ll enjoy the movie dvd is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features i doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film i m just happy it was released on dvd if you are a fan of low budget horror comedy movies this movie may appeal to you it s no evil dead but it is an entertaining movie	positive
not a great one here entertaining for all the wrong reasons mainly because the film is so bad so often it is nice to see christina ricci in a movie again as she s usually good even in a bad movie and doesn t do too bad here wes craven directs this one and i could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation \( much like edward norton in the italian job \) i could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects as they were very lousy at times especially when they finally showed the werewolf as i said before quite predictable the story was both ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck then both try to figure out what s wrong with them though the brother is much more active about it than ricci it s also quite obvious who the main werewolf was the film tries a bit of a swerve but it doesn t really work besides ricci the cast includes shannon elizabeth \( american pie 1 2 \) portia de rossi \( arrested development \) joshua jackson \( pacey on dawson s creek \) scott baio \( don t ask me why \) among others all do pretty poor jobs besides ricci that is the rest don t really seem to care not that i blame them that is there is some humor throughout the film but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it the only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew	negative
who would give the green light to this it is a total remake of the 1968 classic the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it it pales in comparison to the original this was really weird to remake this movie dawn of the dead was cool b c it had a new fresh spin to the story this has no scares no atmosphere no innovations and no riveting performances skip this one	negative

i first saw this movie on tv as a college student i loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on vhs tape i have watched this movie so many times i m surprised the vhs tape is still working the actors are perfectly cast in the leads they are so believeable in their portrayals that i could have gone to high school with them the kissing scene is hot clothes don t need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene the characters are not glossy and that is what i love about john hughes he portrays coming of age in all its naked and truest glory not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years if you re looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack this is your type of movie	positive
i love jeff goldblum but he didn t carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck \) and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it s obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii wasn t much better	negative
granted i saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party but i think i had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was it s so bad it has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved and the script was just awful gosh it s hard to believe i actually sat through it it was just so exactly what it was i guess a stupid sex comedy that s absolutely terrified to be anything else the thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material i think my real downfall here was the fact that i m a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys the scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it s almost ridiculous now i m not one to get offended easily but this just took it a bit too far just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed which isn t really something i look for in a movie it just seems to me that if gay had been replaced with black this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn t ever have been released not that i m condoning censorship but when your tone becomes so mocking i guess oh well i guess all i m trying to say is i will definitely not be repeat viewing this film and i don t recommend you view it at all if you re a woman or gay or you care about others	negative
this movie made no sense to me whatsoever it wasn t really funny and it wasn t scary the only thing that i got was that he killed zombies or returners as he called theme and was upssed with one i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot but that was the only good thing in the film it was also boring but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you	negative

the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because be cool is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would ve been more intersing if somebody would ve said hey don t forget the book but being true to the original source is not hollywood s strong suit be cool provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there s too little to sustain a full length feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a clich the rock does the best he can but again he s a gay bodyguard he s the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he s an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili s obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman s performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there s just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch get shorty again or read be cool	negative
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that can t be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics	negative

although many reviewers didn t like the second part of the hills i still wouldn t call it one of the worst sequels ever or the worst wes craven film certainly this is not a masterpiece even in the framework of horror genre but i don t see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick when i was watching it i came to a conclusion early wes craven had been imitating other directors rather often i m not saying he was not original at all eventually he shot a nightmare on elm street in 1984 but the hills have eyes were reminiscent of texas chainsaw massacre and in the beginning of 80s when slasher era started i guess craven decided to make something in the same manner maybe the reason was craven s long time buddy sean cunningham created friday the 13th in 1980 and wes was envious \) anyway the second part of the hills have eyes turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time and it obviously wasn t the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned friday the 13th the score was written by harry manfredini known to every friday fan and the music in hills 2 is just like in early fridays the body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie kevin blair who had a leading male part here would star in friday the 13th part vii a couple of years later along with kane hodder who did stunts for the hills have eyes 2 and in friday would play you know whom of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies \( like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together all the big strong guys get killed and a handicapped girl survives i m not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning especially if you ve seen a couple of horror films in your life \) but is that a problem for a true horror fan we ve learned not to take this trivia into account so i think the hills have eyes 2 managed on many levels and it would be interesting to have it in your collection if you have the first one for they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror	positive

this is an honestly forgivably slightly too long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three dimensional characters and capture much of war s bad brutality \( but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged nazis \) i love the scenes best where sutherland plays a general and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance with the dozen \( interesting if english jill ireland had been one of the ladies there with charles bronson looking at her which she wasn t but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine \) before i saw the film i heard ernest borgnine was in the movie and i thought he was going to be one of the dozen there is no really solidly likable member of the dozen \( sutherland s probably the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped \) and borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a convict instead they ve got him in a more dull role of a general but what the dozen lack in likability they make up for in interest cassavettes \( whom i strongly physically resemble by the way \) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member of the dozen and he shines best savalas is next best as the lust hating psycho \( hey sex between men and women is needed to produce babies telly or the human race would have ceased to exist a long time ago and the book of genesis talks of man and woman becoming one \) bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just 8 years later he d be the very different vigilante paul kersey of death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler fellow he plays here marvin brilliant in the lead as the head major leading the dozen \( probably even better than the very good john wayne would have been \) nice turn by bob ryan as a decent colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the covert dozen the rest of the cast is mostly very good too very good film	positive

the first half of this movie starts out promising the 2nd half is not so good it becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical whereas it started out charming and promising of particular annoyance is the ending where we find the hackneyed politically correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple s separation and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he indeed the wife s character is strikingly uneven in this movie her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half quite inconsistent	negative
by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years it s true the patriots somehow pieced together a team that despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17 2 record \( which just as easily could have should have been 18 1 \) but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just doesn t seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003 part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities \( 2001 having 9 11 the coming of age of tom brady the snow bowl and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy the early stumbles to buffalo and washington the birth of the winning streak winter weather in foxboro and yet another thrilling super bowl finish \) 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the w on the patriots side of the field this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling the injuries \( leading to the incredible throwback two way play of veteran wide receiver rookie cornerback troy brown \) the continued winning streak the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts and the return to pittsburgh \( where the record 21 game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween \( just days after the red sox won the world series karmically enough \) where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville fl no nail biting endings this time though despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else \( with the possible exception of curt schilling of course \) the eagles all pro was clearly the second best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day \( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick actually \) and the patriots though trailing early never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24 21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved far be it that a season ending with a record of 17 2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum drum but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that impressive as it was just doesn t translate to the memorable re telling that the pats previous title years do this is a great dvd for pats fans indispensible even but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd s over this one	positive
2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn t require you to have seen the original i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out and having never seen the original i thought i would be lost and wouldn t enjoy myself as much as other people but on the contrary i left the experience much happier than when i came in this film is full of quick one liners that deserve a laugh the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open i have heard and read that people didn t appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races but overall i think the balance works well even thinking of the plot that we are left with i really can t see another time when a race would even be appropriate and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original i would have to disagree why frankly i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor \( i mean c mon have you seen the pacifier \) he s nothing more than a meat head who while able to do pretty good fight scenes should leave the dialogue to someone else yes this film is for the younger crowd and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place \( take the boat jumping as an example \) but there is no saying that an older person wouldn t enjoy it as well the only thing that i will say is that you really shouldn t go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance or else you will be disappointed if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is however you will thoroughly enjoy yourself	positive

first of all yes this film was made in vancouver with only a few shots of the manhattan skyline when golden harvest was making this film they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn t show any mountains and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night then jackie chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action well action was what they focused on the most indeed it sure is funny to see how the chinese thought of the united states at this time because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls you also get multi ethnic gangs trashing places \( seriously the gang has a native american with pigtails and a frayed jacket that s almost offensive \) you have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars you have random small crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits bizarre indeed as for the actions this film has some of his best the first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb and graceful using his jacket to dispatch enemies and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over he takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered very impressive this leads to a scene where he s being chased around the streets of new york where the entire gang on motor cycles try to run him over and jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey he also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building no harness or wiresupport the fight scene at the gang s hideout is also one his best using whatever object he can get his hands ont and very acrobatic also jackie chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land some of this was done on a broken ankle if this dvd was uncut and undubbed and had the original score i d give it a total of three stars unfortunately for a so so film new line makes it worse some of the dubbing is very bad it seems as if new line dubbed some of the original english dialouge also only very very little of the original cantonese dialouge is there also the film s original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock many many scenes were cut from the original movie not only that but some of the action scenes were cut too try and find an uncut version out there this dvd you should stay away from	negative
i was hoping that socermania would be on the extreme sports fun dvd but no instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the disney treasures this also goes for the other two dvd s extreme music and adventure fun allthough pluto s blue note donald s dilemma no sail old sequoia and trailer horn are on dvd for the first time but with the new disney treasures disney rarities and the chronological donald volume 2 \( which might i add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration \) who needs these dvds so i suggest not to buy these cheap dvd s and buy the treasures in spite of the bad restoration	negative

watching this movie is a very bizarre experience having attended high school in the countryside close to large clusters of amish farms i had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing amish teenagers i dismissed most of them as rumor this movie confirmed that those wild stories i heard were probably true a very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most americans cannot even begin to comprehend worth a rental at the very least	positive
as the us european command a 2 \( director of air intelligence \) during this phase of the disintegration of yugoslavia i was surprised to see the ending what happened to the admiral and pilot historical no way the only plane shot down was a single seat us air force f 16 pioted by capt mcbrien \( sp \) while on combat air patrol \( cap \) no cameras some naval f 14s carried film loaded cameras in pods but most of the imagery pin pointing mass graves came from u 2s and satellites \( and good coordination with french peacekeepers on the ground \) so this movie was fiction it could have conveyed a better message a better review of the decay of the former yugoslavia and the dominant role of serbian forces but the producers decided action via fiction was better than learning fact	negative
i have to admit that i actually enjoyed this movie i certainly liked it better than red planet i believe mission to mars to be the better of the two movies it has a stellar cast and i thought good on screen chemistry between the actors most of the special effects were excellent all in all it is a good directorial effort by brian de palma somehow however this has become the movie that viewers love to hate well i am afraid that i disagree as i found it to be a pretty decent sci fi move of course i am partial to this genre of film so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie the premise of this movie is simple a crew is sent on a mission to mars the mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil a new crew of four go on a rescue mission these four tim robbins connie nielsen gary sinise and jerry o connell make up the rescue crew due to problems encountered in space only three of the four make it to mars when they get to mars they find the surviving crew member debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is in fact a giant metallic head made in the image of man therein lies the mystery what they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before the ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies 2001 a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind so i ask you how bad can this movie be on the contrary it is actually pretty good better yet it can be watched by the entire family	positive

i saw this flick when it first came out and was chilled to the bone it was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about new york city as well as a cold impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up over 35 years later on review it is still one of the scariest movies ever made the twists are nuanced and plentiful as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating looking for monsters one need only look in the mirror roman polanski was and still is as far as i can tell a master manipulator of perception rosemary s baby is one of his finest films and its timeless theme the struggle between good and evil unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released oh and i braved coming to new york 10 years after the film premiered still here and loving the city i realized eventually of course that new york as in so many films was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold a player in the molding of the film s atmosphere but not the cause it could have been set anywhere and been just as effective	positive
this one is an old favorite of mine which i pre ordered on dvd the instant i learned it was available i have an old vhs recording of the film which i have viewed many times i have also read the book many times and i consider it to be conroy s best work this is the story of four young men at carolina military institute a fictional military academy located in south carolina which is of course a pseudonym for the citadel which is a fine military academy that really does exist the film is set in the 1960s the first black cadet \( first year cadets are called knobs at the institute \) has just arrived a secret society within the institute known as the ten has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the institute regardless of ability david keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet s designated mentor the plot moves at a fast pace but nevertheless does not feel rushed purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub plots contained in the novel i feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries i liked the script the acting and the ending this is a wonderful film it is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years and i am delighted that it will shortly be available on dvd	positive
i like this movie a lot not just because it is made by visconti \( one of the greatest cinematic figures of the 20th century \) or because of its cast \( dirk bogarde and helmut griem are always good \) no i think it is the way the film attempts to look at a bigger picture through the corruption that surrounds a wealthy family that makes this film so interesting you can see elements of this style in other visconti films like the leopard in coppola s godfather trilogy and in fassbinder s maria braun now to speak of visconti s visual genius has there ever been a director who could sustain a scene in such a virtuosic way as in the nazi party scene midway through the film or again in death in venice with the scenes on the beach anyway enough of my babble just see the films of visconti and you will see what i mean	positive
another film in the never ending series of giant animated snake eats people films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade the creators of a maximum security prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten million plus slumber of 80 foot hungry reptile there s nothing more to this film than that boa \( also known as new alcatraz \) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness which i don t think was a smart idea the technical team photography production design set decoration etc create a fairly effective chilling atmosphere but everything else about boa is strictly routine dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable although elizabeth lackey is just that lacking as his wife and the supporting cast \( mark sheppard grand l bush craig wasson \) is just a touch more professional the film makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can t see just how fake it looks i don t really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with other similar titles include python 1 and 2 anaconda \( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 \) and anaconda search for the blood orchid and the inevitable boa vs python the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors 2	negative
i enjoy greek mythology and i love this story although there was alot of bad acting especially from the lead character jason who acted like he was stoned throughout the film i was expecting the hydra guarding the golden fleece but got a oversized komoto dragon \( lost me there \) this film had potential but the director went off on some wierd drug indused trip overall i was dissappointed and was expecting more sorry	negative
i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd it is here a very good movie i have to say the inspector carson \( belonging to an unknown federal agency \) character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate his lines in the movie \( particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan kris kristofferson \) discuss politics during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra great bit part acting by rip torn roberts blossom \( as the desert rat \) tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well anyone who has been in law enforcement or any other supervisory capacity for that matter has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol totally inept the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes a must see movie	positive
michael moore filmed this propaganda partially financed by the united auto workers to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion made possible by gm s unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomes the reason for the plant closings years of losses at gm have shown moore s twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain all of gm s problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross slow redesign cycles lack of money for research you name it moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice they find the better value in asian autos nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough enough is enough and moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a documentary	negative
i thought the first ice age was great this one is good not great they really used scrat better this time than before but the rest of the characters were not undeveloped but it just didn t have as many hilarious situations sid is as hilarious as ever but manny and diego doen t do as much its a good fun movie but its not as good as the first one rent it though it does have some hilarious scenes	positive
i saw transamerica months ago and i still think about it there are many reasons most obviously felicity huffman s portrayal of bree a man determined to become a woman trying to close the door on his past just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child but transamerica also brings a funny poignant and at times visually beautiful road trip across the united states in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles let alone 3000 it brings unexpected and uncertain romance it brings out humanity in all its characters \( save one minor one \) including bree s bitter mother finally it plot spoiler here concludes with tentative reconciliation acceptance and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future transamerica is not loud not big budget not spectacular but there are few movies near as good as it	positive
in this sixth \( but not final \) installment of the movie series what we get is little story and too much senseless action \( with a sprinkling of hot tub sex \) this is a very disappointing film although it is the last such lwnc movie from this creative team it does not end the storyline \( with 28 volumes in the manga series we probably would have needed another 3 7 films \) so the patient constant viewer gets instead a hack and slash film of mid caliber the ending an over extending action sequence set on a snowy slope is very unsatisfying so are the characters unlike other lwnc films we do not get to meet any new incidental characters as a result the film is less about edo soceity \( which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team \) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen waiting waiting to happen the film is way too long and its pacing is horrible i think the fault with the film lies in these two things 1 \) the writers filmmakers chose poor source material the five wheel assassin team denies itto and son the chance to mingle with regular edo joes as a result you do not get as i argued the best part of the series the rich detail of edo life 2 \) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with james bond films like on her majesty s secret service and whatnot with their decision to make this movie samurai on skis after the first few minutes of fighting on the snow i was thinking enough already i get it samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment	negative
ok i rounded up to 4 stars this really isn t bad though it s an idiom that most american viewers won t be familiar with the major characters are kuan yin confucius and a flock of other gods godlings immortals buddhas figures from myth and other well known figures and stereotypes from the chinese pantheon there are the flying heroes improbable weapons and acting at least on a par with the dr who series in other words lots of viewers will see it as alien disconnected and amateurish as well as being filled overly convenient miracles but it s not in the western idiom so parts of it have to be taken in their own terms and it has the look of a low budget film so you won t see effects on the star wars scale and it is a bit cheesy and over the top which is part of the appeal the fights are bloodless the romance is chaste and all but the youngest kids will understand the characters if you don t take it or yourself too seriously there s a lot of fun in this one wiredweir	positive
i saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine i was strongly mistaken johnny depp is a great actor with great abilites but this is the worst movie of his i have ever seen even his cheesy movies were better than this the rated r rating is light i couldn t believe how pornographic it was even in quills it wasn t as raunchy as this don t waste your money or your time with this one	negative
believe the good reviews written here about this film i havent cared much thus far for the movies penn has directed after this one i suppose its because i feel this is such a great film he created a tough act to follow but even if he never does top it he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time i like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into and this is one of those although i would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas but overall this is a great movie with great performances by all and it packs an after punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over im not easily touched by most movies but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits its without a doubt one of my favorite films this is the kind of film that reminds you movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art	positive
when i first purchased the low budget movie named pranks i didn t really know what to expect after all pranks is a slasher horror movie from the 80s a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general unfortunately after viewing pranks i can honestly say that this is not one of them pranks is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down i think \( herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor \) obviously most kids have gone home for christmas and new year s except for this group of kids and one weird kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur the murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged the plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic generic and lacks luster throughout the film one of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie there is no question that pranks is a low budget production to begin with and along with that there is going to be some subpar acting but the acting in pranks is borderline awful it is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested in fact the movie comes off very generic in style and substance and rather predictable and boring the only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which aren t too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from the director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the weird guy as a red herring as another reviewer put it in summary pranks is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting extremely poor production values and flawed direction the result is a dull boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills certainly nothing to write home about also as a final note the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off in the end at least like a total wuss	negative
daniel deronda is george eliot s 1876 novel dealing with the rise of zionism incarnated in young daniel deronda sadly but truly this is the first major english novel giving a positive view of the jewish people deronda is raised by the wealthy sir malinger as an english gentleman in the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a jew meets his mother and is the love object of two fascinating women mirah lapidoth is the jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by daniel her love for daniel burgeons as she comes to know and love the kind young man gwendolyn harleth played by the brilliant acting of romola garai is the spoiled impecunious husband hunter who weds the rich cad grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates she loves deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of psychological combat like all bbc productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear this tale runs about four hours and is a joy many american viewers may be dismayed at the slow leisurely pace of british productions please remember that these productions are based on long english novels which were published in several monthly parts they are long but they are also wonderful explorations of the human soul gwendolyn s story is a bildungsroman in which she grows as a person ditto for deronda who learns to take pride in his hebrew heritage this is a worthy bbc production well worth the viewer s time and money	positive
with the straight story lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love this film felt like a blind date gone bad the straight story showed up david lynch arrived but the rest of the date felt muddled confusing and utterly disastrous everything in this film seemed wrong lynch s choice for lead actor the bland sissy spacek the filler of repeat cornfield montages all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read i just felt that nobody had control over this picture yet the randomness \( and the possible tear ending \) gave critics something to smile about this is not a david lynch film and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive twin peaks or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois it just seemed repetitive and boring what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose alvin lying on the ground because he can t get up the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame spacek s depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors then to add more fuel to the fire there was richard farnsworth again he isn t a horrible actor but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically but alas couldn t master it mentally farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen i couldn t tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime i saw it as babble \( and no i am not that insensitive i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger more professional actor \) the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant i wanted lynch to either go 100 for this film or none at all but alas it felt as if he just half ed his way through this heap speaking of david lynch where did he go in this film there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns looking at america class i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film instead of keeping us by alvin s side throughout his journey lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while but when the same images were used over and over again i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin but the stock footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way alvin was a walking storybook filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well lynch made alvin very closed minded which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature alvin was a strong character but i needed more with this story i wanted him to make choices learn new things and bring that to his brother s table when they eventually met i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin and not vice versa overall i wasn t stunned by this picture i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just played it safe the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin speaking of alvin why couldn t he have been a stronger better rounded character i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america but instead gave us nothing more than soft music recycled images and stock characters the stories were interesting to listen to but brought nothing fresh to the table i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye \( since i have a brother as well \) but why couldn t we focus on this further lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan when it was the central focus of this film the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch but instead it felt jagged and old i could suggest one viewing for this film any further and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be grade out of	negative

the star trek collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series dvd collections \( the original series the next generation deep space nine voyager and enterprise \) at around 1100 minutes per box \( a few hours less than the tos seasons \) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing that is 1 month of non stop star trek no dvd series comes remotely close to that get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years by the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe this is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years it is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also our very planet earth has advanced because of gene roddenberry s admirable concept roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too the bridge members are like our family watch what they do then go and spend your life striving for the same on earth what engineer medic scientist teacher worker can not say that star trek has not influenced them the show is this significant in the development of our species even christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why the dvd case is not quite as fancy as the tos \( the original series \) cases the tng case is supposed to resemble a tng crew briefcase the case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs there are 4 episodes per disc however the last disc disc 7 only has two episodes for a grand total of 26 episodes \( tos has 8 discs 30 episodes \) the rest of disc 7 is devoted to star trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras and then some more the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed but in the sequence that they aired however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in this means on one disc you have shows 4 2 12 and 1 in that order the sound has also been remastered to 5 1 dolby digital since the show was shot in full frame these dimensions are retained star trek the next generation \( tng \) season one had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast an instant hit and a milestone in television serials \( it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3 \) its characters and new look enterprise had us glued to the tv with the first computer generated images of our solar system as captain picard utters the immortal words to baldly i mean to boldly go where no man i mean to boldly go where no one has gone before viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the tos series but is more of the same again \( even remaking some tos episodes \) this time with more characters more action and more special effects season 1 all of the main characters in the tng series are in episode one captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant lt commander geordi la forge lieutenant tasha yar lieutenant worf commander dr beverly crusher lt commander commander deanna troi lt commander data and ensign wesley crusher only natasha yar quits before the first season is finished commander dr beverly crusher is replaced by doctor katherine pulaski for season two ensign wesley crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after season four the enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing playing an important function in many episodes the use of computer generated images \( a ground breaking television experience back in 1987 \) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences planets backdrops an improved bridge main viewer and windows advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android tng season one attempts to relate with tos by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made tos so interesting the stories \( also written by tos s dc fontana \) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s early 90s when tng first aired season one of tng is mostly about deities infections alien cultures galactic politics time travel alien forces mind control family matters computer malfunctions and starfleet academy there are also the unforgettable episodes encounter at farpoint which introduces us to the crew of the enterprise and the mysterious q where no one has gone before a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos datalore which features two data characters heart of glory with some in depth revelations about klingons skin of evil featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending and the classic conspiracy \( this episode is uncut which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings so parents be cautious \) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of starfleet the bottom line for tng season one is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out although we can debate about which is the better series tng or tos we still absolutely adore both we might miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume but hearing picard saying make it so just makes our day season 2 season two still carries on with repeating much of the stories in tos revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own boosting data s screen time bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres improved alien cgi and an enhancement in particle effects they even attempt a type of morphing most of the main characters from season one are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker \( now with a beard \) lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf \( letting his hair grow \) commander deanna troi \( complete with low cut red starfleet costume \) lt commander data and ensign wesley crusher however obviously commander lieutenant tasha yar is gone but so is dr beverly crusher \( who was not bad looking \) replaced by doctor katherine pulaski \( who looks like your granny \) for season two because dr crusher has been reassigned to starfleet medical as explained in episode one of season three \( in reality the tng writers where having difficulties in developing crusher s character would later reinstate her for season three dropping pulaski because they felt her character was not working \) colm meaney as miles edward o brien navigation from season one gets more screentime while the new whoopi goldberg chatacter guinan is the wise el aurian bartender in 10 forward the new bar room where the enterprise crew get to relax except for this extra area the enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more enterprise based than season one or all of tos meaning season two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback but sets a new standards in the hotel in space feel that would produce the deep space nine series season two of tng is mostly about alien impregnation mystery space ai the holodeck interplanetary relations rapid aging justice shape shifting time travel family the prime directive kidnapping cloning war games and infections the big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with klingons and the first encounter with the borg the unforgettable episodes are elementary dear data where data takes on his sherlock holmes persona and we are introduced to the moriarty character loud as a whisper is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator a matter of honor is where riker serves on a klingon battleship q who may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the borg the last episode of season two shades of gray may be one of the worst star trek episodes ever which uses riker s memories from seasons one and two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the season one episode conspiracy featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings so parents be cautious again \) the bottom line for tng season two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down we get the borg and lots and lots of klingons at this stage in the saga we might still miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume but how will picard defeat those assimilating half man half machine entities that are heading his way he better make it so with season three season 3 it was the dawn of the 90s and since cgi had undergone some development the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence but with better looking planets \( complete with moving gaseous atmospheres \) and major enhancements in particle effects towards the end it undergoes new model development lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look the crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker \( now with a bigger belly \) lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf \( letting his hair grow even more \) commander deanna troi \( with more makeup costume changes and even an aerobics outfit that really isn t as good as it sounds \) lieutenant commander data and ensign wesley crusher \( new hairdo \) dr beverly crusher is back \( initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better \) and doctor katherine pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again pulaski s disappearance is not officially explained \( in reality diana muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in l a law instead mcfadden was asked to rejoin the series again \) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with dr crusher making reference to pulaski s work in episode four commander lieutenant tasha yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode dwight schultz \( murdoch from the a team \) makes his first appearance as lieutenant reg barkley who would have a reoccurring role colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien navigation doesn t have much of a role boost since season two while the whoopi goldberg s guinan character of the wise el aurian the bartender in 10 forward has her background further developed season three of tng is mostly about nanotechnology colonization super aliens the prime directive orphans ancient space booby traps romulans wormholes peace negotiations defectors super humans terrorism q court inquisitions parallel universes ai klingon high councils captivity experiments time travellers biological space crafts morale the first law of robotics vulcans sarek evolutionary speciation and the borg unlike season two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season evolution where nanotechnology takes over the enterprise the survivors is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet who watches the watchers is about the prime directive failing when the enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped offspring sees data creating another sentient android sins of the father has worf return to his klingon homeworld to defend his family honour hollow pursuits has lt barkley fantasizing about crew members in the holodeck sarek is about the vulcan of the same name from star trek the original series who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation and of course the pot boiler end episode of the best of both worlds part i \( widely acclaimed as one of the best star trek episodes ever \) marks the grand entrance of locutus of borg onto the scene the bottom line for tng season three is that it is often cited by fans as the best tng season and is probably the first of the seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets in season three everyone seems to have matured included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie especially towards the end there is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since j r ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff hanger episode that the best of both worlds part i would deliver on meaning every trekie \( and who wasn t at this time \) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved there is no time to loose onto season four wooosshhhh season 4 not since j r ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff hanger episode that the best of both worlds part i would deliver on at the end of season iii meaning every trekie \( and who wasn t at this time \) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved there was no time to lose onto season four wooosshhhh so here we are with season three it was the dawn of the 90s and cgi had undergone some development and improvements \( better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres particle effects lighting and subspace effects \) with season three things started to have more of a movie budget look season four tries to maintain that class most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf \( who keeps growing that hair \) commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data dr beverly crusher and ensign wesley crusher \( now a starfleet officer with full uniform also departs from tng half way through this season and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons \) colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien and whoopi goldberg s guinan lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for season four such as worf s lover k ehleyr the traveller k mpec the klingon leader duras whose dishonesty caused worf s discommendation and the romulan tomalak there is also a surprise character at the end of this season season four of tng is mostly about the borg family dr soong and the ai emotion chip adoption the space time continuum hostage rescue the klingon high council romulans alternative universes holographic projection survival loosing special abilities renegade captains the devil amnesia first contact love nightmares mutations super intelligence robin hood witch hunt trials euthanasia host life forms mind control and honour like season three most the episodes in season four have great stories combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did it is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established apart from containing part ii of the best of both worlds the introduction of the cardassians who would become major players in the star trek deep space nine franchise makes it even more valuable there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season the best of both worlds part ii concludes the cliff hanger from season three with some great battle special effects family has picard going home to see his brother and family brothers features dr soong who is data s creator reunion returns to the story of worf and his klingon dishonour the wounded features the cardassians for the first time clues has data disobeying picard first contact sees riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring the the nth degree has barclay taking control of the enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence qpid for its historical recreation of robin hood and of course redemption part i which deals with worf s dishonour the bottom line for tng season four is that it keeps up the pace of season three and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want although not quite the cliff hanger end episode that the best of both worlds part i was redemption part i still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know we are left asking ourselves if the hard man is really gone and why does she look like a romulian as picard would say i can live with a mystery but we just can t onto season five as quick as we can season 5 season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects the display panels on the enterprise are more interactive the camera can now pan as special effects take place deep space battles seem more intense we also get a new star trek title graphic in the opening sequence the cliff hanger conclusion of redemption part ii is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between klingons romulans and the federation turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get none the less it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of tasha yar most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard \( with a new red suede coat and grey uniform \) commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge \( who sports a new beard in one episode \) lieutenant commander worf \( who left the enterprise in season four \) commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data and dr beverly crusher ensign wesley crusher \( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons \) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren a bajoran colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien as is whoopi goldberg s guinan alexander rozhenko as worf s son now has a reoccurring role since season four keiko o brien \( miles o brien s wife \) is firmly established as a reoccurring character watch out for the special appearances of ashley judd as ensign robin lefler and leonard nimoy as spock whoot whoot strangely enough this is the only season where q of the omnipotent q continuum does not make an appearance lieutenant reginald barclay engineer is also absent from this season season four of tng is mostly about the klingon high council romulans communication bajora crystalline entities disasters addiction reunification time travel parenting telekinesis eugenics amnesia possession euthanasia sexual repression time warps children cover ups sexual attraction imaginary friends borg invisibility alternative lives and phase shifting like season four most the episodes in season five have great stories a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew it much more of the same as in season four with the better episodes being redemption part ii darmok an interesting episode about language the introduction of the bajora and ensign ro the silicon avatar makes a return unification part i and ii \( both here \) with spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole tng franchise certainly more popular than time s arrow part i which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to data on earth the masterpiece society shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world huge of borg also makes his first appearance in i borg apart from the unification double episode the instalments ethics about worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and the game when entertainment becomes mind control have both achieved cult status as some of the best tng episodes ever aired season five unfortunately has some dull episodes too many of which occur in the second half of the season so the best stuff is within the first four discs it doesn t really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with season six but no doubt because six is as good as five was then we are there for it as a note redemption part ii this episode received as 12 age rating in the uk because it contains klingon ritual head butting violations also has sexually violent content \( psychic rape \) parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children if you are going to move onto season six then you will probably want to know that during season six the crew make contact with deep space nine so if you get deep space nice season one you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order if you are in for six you may also be in for season one of ds9 season 6 season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that star trek deep space nine season 1 whipped up while season 6 was running 1993 was tv sci fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of st for the year this means for the folks who have been watching tos and tng now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between tng season 6 and ds9 season 1 you can find the order if you search the new for it tng has really good stories while ds9 gets the effects we are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises \( picard acting like a russian is hysterical would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time maybe yes \) the conclusion of time s arrow is not the best cliff hanger but sufficient most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data and dr beverly crusher ensign wesley crusher \( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons \) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren a bajoran colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien but will be transferred to ds9 \( his absence is not mentioned \) whoopi goldberg s guinan is back along with alexander rozhenko keiko o brien \( miles o brien s wife \) will also leave for ds9 lieutenant reginald barclay engineer is back after being absent from season 5 season 6 of tng is mostly about transporter psychosis empaths scotty alien abductions q age regression android dreams artificial life cardassians prof moriarty love romulan defection destiny klingon birthrights thieves command ethics origins of life insanity murder faith doubles time travel and the borg like season 5 most the episodes in season 6 have above average sci fi stories combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew memorable episodes include a fistful of datas the quality of life ship in a bottle face of the enemy birthright and lessons there are three very good episodes which really make the season worth tapestry sees picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart suspicion is a great whodunit episode \( of which there are a few \) with one of the coolest star trek aliens ever \( should have made him a main character \) descent part i is a very nice slight of hand trick you will keep thinking hugh right up until the last second season 7 star trek season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion making way for some star trek films but in reality it is deep space nine season 2 \( ds9 season 1 starts in star date chronological order with tng season 6 \) that is the new trek fans of star trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional sf tv era the conclusion of descent part ii has the finale of lore most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data and dr beverly crusher ensign wesley crusher \( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons \) returns for one episode while ensign ro laren a bajoran was supposed to replace him she only appears in one episode in season 7 although the episode is a major one focused on her colm meaney shows up again as miles edward o brien for the last episode whoopi goldberg s guinan is gone without explanation \( see the movie star trek nemesis on her \) alexander rozhenko is back keiko o brien \( miles o brien s wife \) is not here either \( after leaving for ds9 \) lieutenant reginald barclay engineer is back again season 6 of tng is mostly about lore emotional studies interfaces mercenaries nightmares psychic trauma beverly and picard warp travel environmental damage data s mother alternate realities the pegasus worf s human brother incubus top secret missions radiation sickness deities troi and worf reverse evolution wesley and the traveller klingon right of ascension picard s son abiogenesis ro laren and time travel while there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one \( masks for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise \) most are well above average and some are incredible memorable episodes include gambit forces of nature inheritance lower decks thine own self journey s end and bloodlines the pegasus is probably the best episode of the season but the finale all good things is really where it is at with some good aging effects a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic enterprise to die for the series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek in short there is nothing like st tng it evolved tv serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years it set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars all we can say about this awe inspiring series can be summed up in one word amen	positive
this dvd will bring tears to your eyes my father was a professional violist for over 40 years and got much pleasure from this video my mother enjoys watching this video at least once a week it will inspire any young violinst to play with more feeling and overall satisfaction just seeing the old footage of the great masters of long ago is worth your purchase if you are a lover of music you must have this in your collection	positive
this movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche the nuclear testing mutant premise seemed promising but all the main characters were stupid annoying seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters the script writers director threw in lots of unnecessary gore for the most part though the special effects were at least well done however a few of the effects were somewhat misguided for instance blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red wouldn t it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat acting was mediocre i ve never seen the original so i cannot say whether this is better or worse the movie is not for the faint of heart simply because of the gore but it definitely wasn t very scary two stars	negative

im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	negative
the best edition so far however the color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me but what do you want for 10 bucks i saw gorgo a bunch of times in first run and i remember seeing the actual gorgo creature on it s trailer being driven up woodward ave in detroit on it s way to the fox theater a great promo the eyes are the thing i remember most as gorgo rises from the sea those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive the color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes but still this print is the best i ve seen if i live long enough i hope they issue a perfect hd version of this movie i would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that but this is worth the cost a must for any serious collector	positive
sometimes i wonder how it is we don t live in a vigilante society people do such awful things and alot of times the system really can t don t do anything for the victims well in this film this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son s killer would be dealt with story takes place in a small town where the strout family is a big deal you know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers there is also the fowler family which also make their way in the town she is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son frank that is dating an older woman \( marisa tomei \) and she has 2 sons well the strout family s son is married to marisa tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren t even divorced yet can t say that i blame him there but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly moving along the strout s son kills frank and because of the strout s clout and the fact that the ex wife didn t actually see him fire the shot he is going to get off with manslaughter this does not sit well with the fowler s the fowler s have a friend that has over 300 acres of land so you can only imagine what happens i certainly don t condone vigilantism however i just loved the ending the strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail so since it appeared that he jumped bail they will lose all of that beautiful then they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets i couldn t help but get some satisfaction out of that myself very real and very interesting great movie	positive
this is the 6th and last entry in the series lone wolf cub this one not only has a different director than kenji who directed 4 of the others this is the entry most like a comic book \( the series is based on a famous comic book series \) not that that is bad the whole series fluctuated between great period detail serious themes and not taking itself too seriously it was at once graphic and fantastic realistic and wildly improbable factual and imaginary serious silly that s what made it so damn interesting throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of japan tracing actual historical roads and cities now we end the series in the mountains and the snow the white heaven in hell of the title this entry has a lot of stuff going on lord retsudo of the hated yagyu clan ogami s arch enemy sends his last child a daughter to do in ogami with her falling dagger technique when predictably she fails he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe the downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in her majesties secret service but it ain t bad that ogami s baby cart guns never seem to need reloading etc are minor quibbles if ogami doesn t shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them behead them or run em through red sprays all over the white snow anyway they wind the series up with a bang one of the strangest most unique and unusual series ever produced anywhere worth it if you don t mind the violence	positive
as cute and talented as i think hugh jackman is this production was a waste of time space and money everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves the acting is bad the script is horrendous and the cg people apparently think their stuff don t stink which it does badly it s not the worse movie i ve seen but it s surprisingly close please don t waste your time with this film	negative

the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good i bought this primarily to see jaco the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 s added in i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances also it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut i still give it 5 stars regardless	positive

i really wish amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars this movie is nothing but anti gun propaganda i have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this but it was like watching a train wreck i just had to stay for the end you know for those of you who don t know firearms save far more innocent lives than they take every year and mine was one of them this movie cd might make a good coaster but beyond that it is trash some less than truthful nra member \( yeah right \) wrote i really liked and enjoyed this movie the acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention it will keep yours too just give it a chance sure it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry but they deserve it and need to be more responsible i may buy the dvd to watch it again but am overwhelmed with the movies i have bought from amazon com and not gotten around to watching however i may add this to my collection horse hockey member of the nra more like member of the micheal moore fan club this was the worst movie i have ever seen they even had to lie to get you in the theater as nothing was mentioned about it being anti gun in the trailers and saying that it was a little bit slanted is like saying micheal moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie	negative

this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great including a phenomenal cast lead by cate blanchett and great scenery and cinematography the actors playing elizabeth cecil and walsingham spoke and acted admirably each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling but the words themselves rendered the performances useless the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material they should have read elizabeth the first s biography by elizabeth jenkins it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain had the author and director been more historically accurate they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth who is in turn hysterical defeatist overbearing childish tyrannical who never shows her core intelligence her great love of her people who had a private core described by her motto semper eadem be always one elizabeth ruled with her advisors she was not totally ruled by them she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table nor would burleigh have allowed it cate blanchett s wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity much less truth how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna i suggest that he should have first read some english history	negative
over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by zoltan korda even those scenes can t disguise the remake s network tv movie quality beau bridges is generally a good actor but he is terribly miscast on this film go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself	negative

you know i actually enjoyed the first mummy it was funny the idea not often seen in modern films was good and the characters were each in their own way entertaining to watch why god why did they have to go and make a sequel i don t understand was it for the money i m not sure when exactly i began to hate this maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake again really you d think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it s thousand year rest they d learn their lesson but oh no the first time wasn t enough and also the whole having a kid thing didn t seem to work the relationship between the characters wasn t the same anymore i hate it when they do that in movies make sequels and give the once cool main characters children nothing against it just felt wrong for this movie throughout most of this movie i felt stupid and i don t like for things to make me feel that way i also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater maybe it s just me i just didn t like it question of the day for american cinema what s the deal with being obsessed with sequels come on the first was good enough you know what the worst thing is i was actually looking forward to seeing this	negative

i remember watching this in high school i thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now okay we re not talking academy award material here \( emmy \) ralph bill pam are back for the third and final season of this far too short series about a man who is given a suit by aliens that gives him super powers he is teamed with an fbi agent to help the world survive itself in the first few minutes ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how to operate the suit he runs into a few walls literally the first season was a little rough the second season fleshed out the concept this third season started to stretch its legs but the show was cancelled i have looked for years for novels based on the show to no avail i even contacted cannell to ask if i could write them as disney is half heartedly working on a feature film based on the show cannell wouldn t cut loose with permission alas it would ve been fun anyway if you have the other two seasons you ll love this one the only complaint change i would make is having to play the theme song before each episode i would ve made it so you could hit the forward to next button and go right to the action also the jacket plays a bit of the theme song i wish they d made it possible to change the batteries mike hudspeth in st louis missour	positive
while scary movie 4 does work in getting out a couple of laughs it certainly does not live up to the past three many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly are getting pretty old although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as the grudge saw and war of the worlds it misses the funny mark just by a bit personally i felt they could have done a lot more in terms of parodying these films particularily with the grudge the writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier and really was it necessary to spoof films such as brokeback mountain and millionaire dollar baby both of which are not horror films i believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience and is vastly different from what scary movies 1 2 offered \( which i found to be extremely hilarious \) if you re looking for over the top funny look towards the other scary movies	negative

georges seurat was totally insane by the age of 32 knowing that helps stephen sondheim s genius show through sunday in the park with george is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte the first act is completely devoted to a set of sundays spanning 2 years of seurat s life and the end of his relationship with a long time lover the dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard nosed painter yet comical points shine through the second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the great grandson of georges \( also played by mandy patinkin \) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame like other sondheim shows it is at times long winded but altogether entirely enjoyable mandy and mrs peters voice have so much emotion and power that with the correct sound system you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances with commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals	positive

with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance yet doesn t stray too far from what he knows best there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers patton oswalt appears in a blink and you ll miss him scene but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who s roles are a lot more important than the characters they play bates is great as mcconaughey s mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker s flatmate parker should stick to television she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie a good date movie flick the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained special features are nothing too special a trailer and a few dodgy featurette s a rainy night rental movie	negative

john waters is a very brilliant and odd film director he brings camp trash filth humor and morality to all of his movies pushes peoples buttons goes farther than most dare \( and then some \) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point lol people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them \( especially a dirty shame \) to broaden their minds a little more my personal favorites are pink flamingos a dirty shame female trouble polyester and desperate living serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection he has come from underground trash to queen of filth trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold outlandish outspoken and bizzar i applaud you john waters brillant	positive
this is another superbly done documentary from the award winning pbs investigative journalism series frontline \( peabody award emmy and many more \) disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation he s obviously smoking something because this is made and hosted by hedrick smith a pulitzer prize winning journalist who used to write for the ny times he is one of america s most respected journalists i started watching the show since i was in high school \( i m now late 20 s \) and their shows are exceptionally high quality now if frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by walmart how is this pro walmart the story starts in america and its impact on the us economy he interviews some professors economists managers suppliers and executives then the story moves to china and hk and then back to the us there are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in american culture and business history is walmart good for america i can t answer that and neither can frontline this documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle it asks some thought provoking questions the us trade deficit is getting worse every day quality is going up \( some made in china stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year \) and that s really scary for us in america who s the blame well all of us we re not competing well in the global economy and we want the cheapest goods we re not willing to put our money where our mouth is if you re interested in economics history social issues this is a must see if you care about the american economy and global events you should watch this documentary it s loads better than the walmart the high cost of low prices film \( which is very one sided and not nearly as well done \) oh and start learning chinese	positive
i am an alice fan so this is far far from my favorite the first star i gave was simply because i love kate beckinsale and the movie isn t scary the other is because it would be enchanting for a 3 4 year old or another youngster that doesn t know anything about wonderland my 9 year old even got bored with this kate beackinsale plays the mother in the beginning and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so she just didn t look well in this movie and everything looked so cheap and fake the story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out i would not recommend this i would recommend the 1999 american mini series of alice in wonderland it is my absolute favorite with martin short as the mad hatter and a long list of big names that one is fun for all ages	negative

a boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there and they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk they go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up in other words this movie is vintage decoteau it defies all known logic \( the boy shows up for his college interview is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents \) has lame effects and lots of half naked boys it s hard to tell if this is a commentary on the catholic church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed definitely another laugh riot from the director of such classics as leeches and leather jacket love story	negative
i just finished watching callie and son i got my copy from the dollar store and it has another movie \( power passion and murder \) with michelle pfeiffer in it as well it really wasn t that bad considering the price i paid lindsay wagner is actually the main character and i think she did a great job as did most of the actors in this film the only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to with a bit of editing and a bit better script it would have been a great movie the end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying i d recommend it for someone to watch once but i wouldn t pay more than i did for it the dvd quality is really poor the sound fades in and out but for what it was a bargain bin cheapy i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it	positive
if you believe in the devil and i mean really believe in the devil i can t think of one good reason why you d want to summon the devil into this world at worst he s purported to be the father of lies and one of the fallen angels this means that anything he tells you is suspect anything he gives you is suspect and he probably has the power to make you believe in him yikes not a safe trip not a terribly sane trip for that matter yet that is precisely what boris balkan \( frank langella \) desired he had one copy of the nine gates of the kingdom of shadow and there were three extant one or all of these books is a forgery and one or all holds the secret to summoning satan he hires corso \( played a bit too understated by johnny depp \) to research the other texts the movie is based on the novel the club dumas by arturo perez reverte which i favorably reviewed i can t give a similar review to the ninth gate for a number of reasons first depp s portrayal of corso was one dimensional and corso was a multi dimensional character whether that s the filmmaker s fault or depp s i don t know but depp s corso was a dreadful bore a mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his demonstrating supernatural abilities we are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping corso or in what her abilities might have been \( never mind her identity \) yet since this is a character from the book i know why she was there i have a pretty good idea who she was \( and good job to the author on how he handled that \) and her character s interests and abilities could have been better communicated with very little difficulty also in a rather silly departure from the book \( departures are fine i m not being a book snob \) they substitute an average sized platinum blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall white and physically imposing there s nothing that irritates me more than a quota substitute i don t think this particular sub had any speaking lines which makes it that much more of an insult i love intelligent thrillers \( i didn t care for the da vinci code \) this was a thriller that spent time in libraries that examined woodcuttings drawn perhaps by lucifer himself yet i wasn t engaged in 1999 when the film was released i couldn t sit through it after reading the club dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two i approached the film again hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help it did not in fact it raised more questions i would give this movie 2 5 stars and round it up to 3 however i m reviewing the dvd and the dvd gets a big spanking for not having subtitles there s no excuse in this day and age for a mainstream dvd not to offer subtitles	negative

a true love it or hate it movie my reaction fits closer with the first group this gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound the parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills while her son tries to make a living dealing although he his partner and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits the director s jarring style fits the subject matter well and ellen burstyn s performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing julia roberts beat her for best actress in 2000 with erin brockovich which was a fine role and performance but burstyn was in another world those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense i can understand the second objection hence four stars rather than five note i got this movie from netflix i m not sure if i was watching the director s cut or not	positive
supposed being victimized by local communist regime and soviet oppressors since august 1968 a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals no wonder sex is a fix for such a lucky and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with southern european rather than slavic appearance a little extended up to 165 minutes of screening romantic tale with some near porno inclusions is a bit more over positive and over entertaining than its final collapsed in well movie spirit seems being similar to a beautiful life producers or more recent one of levi s hitler as a comedy hero of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only	positive

i m pretty new to the yoga experience i started with a kathy smith dvd \( hated it \) then i got a yoga zone video the one for flexibility and toning and i found it to be very good i then got another video yoga shakti which is excellent too and i was looking for another beginner video \( the yoga shakti one has some advanced parts in it \) so i bought yoga zone introduction to yoga while some of the moves in it are on my first video i still found this to be very good for beginners alan again teaches you the breathing technique which i often forget i noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it yes it does move slow however if you re a beginner and you re just learning the poses the last thing you would want is for it to move fast he takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you re doing it his voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind i honestly have to say that if i did not originally buy a yoga zone dvd i more than likely would not have pursued the practice i think that yoga zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more i highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga lite out there	positive
collateral damage is the great and partially real action film in which arnold schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall with the attacks on sept 11 movies have tried to cash in but collateral damage is different arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview with byron allen the movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks basically the fbi and cia tell gorden brewer \( arnold schwarzennger \) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family when in fact they have no good leads on the suspect rather than sitting on his butt and waiting for the fbi to do something gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family by going into columbia and getting the wolf \( cliff curtis \) as the terrorist is called there is a great scene in which gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their collateral damage the radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims i loved this scene because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead he probably has no family of his own and doesn t know the meaning of life except to cover his own now you might say to yourself what s the difference between arnold s character \( who is going for justice \) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from arnold himself the difference between me and you is that i am only going to kill you unbelievable action and twists at the end that you re literally be on the edge of youre seat and just when you think the movie is over it s not director andrew davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on columbia but also a factual based type movie that deals with terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don t happen again in fact most people will remember the horrible case of wall street reporter daniel pearl who was executed after the u s failed to meet the demands of the middle east terrorist holding the u s should have gone after these terrorists like the way arnold does in this movie but then the u s does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970 s the u s supported and backed up madmen like general pinochet in chile and dictator samoza in nicaragua both of them killed hundreds of people with u s backing and funding still though collateral damage is a great action film that you must see	positive
dare i need tell you how greatly this softcore action thriller sucks ok you might think there are two reasons \( besides those two \) to rent this nudity and hilariously bad acting well there is nudity but not as much as you think if you re getting it for anna s naked flesh be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button she s nude don t get me wrong in the shower in the bed etc but after that first scene she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene her acting is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her tv show she at least doesn t seem stoned there is a plot that involves just kidding i have no idea there are some actual actors and a travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies the movie only still exists because of anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make to the limit more than a free rental if that i should mention that this is a review for the r rated version i don t know if there is an unrated version but it would have to be better than this for more nudity bad acting and a less coherent anna go rent skyscraper	negative
although tomorrow is yesterday is an okay episode it is not one to rave about it is certainly not one of the original series best however return of the archons is one of the best and one of my favourites kirk spock and mccoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions a mob attacks kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers it seems the planet is run by a man named landru who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get absorbed a kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity later it is discovered that landru is a computor projection the edict of landru who died 5 000 years ago has been continued by a computer i just read a review saying the solution to the landru mystery won t surprise anyone it sure surprised me i didn t see that one coming	positive
the flight into new york had been a long one but i was gently revived when kirsten dunst met me at the airport she was to be my escort that night at the lincoln center where the president would present me the distinguished writer s cross the highest award this nation can bestow on an author i quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her mercedes s class sedan to the waldorf astoria downtown i have to admit that i didn t you who you were until i read starless grasslands i don t mean to embarrass you but that book changed my life i tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment for the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while i approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile i very much approved of her legs as i departed the car kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes don t forget i ll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together please be ready i expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp the hotel staff greeted me and soon i entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor as i entered the suite the steward took my request to have my suit blushed prepared and returned in a few hours finally a bit of peace i poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below for a few moments i contemplated the remarks i was to make at this evening s formal ceremonies then i heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room i turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked sandy bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit well crabby aren t you glad to see me before i could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right it was jennifer aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit sweetheart don t look at her come here to me get out screamed sandy no you get out it s not fair i left brad for him so i get him the two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment then sandy leapt at jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other it was a ferocious sight as pulled hair shrieks of pain and nylon tearing could be heard then almost a quickly as it began the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor sandy marched back into the room victorious i ran to the door of the sitting room only to see jennifer laid out on the floor out cold spread eagle and naked before i could think of what to do sandy tapped me on my shoulder i turned around and there sandy stood a little worse for wear trying to catch her breath nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet forget her she won t bother us now sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume she posed standing and anticipating my admiration now i m all sweaty and warm i need a shower sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond i turned around and wondered what i should do for poor jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor then i heard sandy calling crabby why don t you come and help me you could soap up my oops sorry err just a little fantasy of mine i meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over i swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here you see the cover of this dvd displays ms bullock prominently with her name in big font letters but in truth this movie focuses on tate donovan as the main character and only on ms bullock as his unlikely love interest as much as i love sandra bullock i have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her her best films have been while you were sleeping wrestling ernest hemingway and the much unappreciated hope floats unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like fire on the amazon hangman speed 2 and this movie the plot revolves around two losers in love who are unappealing both in looks and personality donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman \( an unrecognizable anne bancroft \) and soon both donovan and bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet all goes well until others find out their secret and donovan and bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other the story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet chances are you can find a copy of this dvd fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you re waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work or your friends to wake up from their naps so you can really do something worth wild	negative

maybe the most engaging documentary ever made brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry producer robert evans giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that i could only describe as psychedelic being a film fanatic for the last 43 years i was shocked and ashamed to find that i had not heard of robert evans in all my reading of credits over the years i had somehow missed his name i had remembered seeing william castle s name at the beginning of rosemary s baby but not evan s then at finding out that he was the driving force behind love story the godfather the godfather pt 2 chinatown and one of my personal favorites the president s analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good well i was just dumbfounded and these are just a fraction of the films he s produced of course he didn t start as a producer he had been in women s apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today while lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by norma shearer lauching his career into show biz it seems he knows everybody and i mean everybody after watchng this extraordinary film i called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality i queried have you ever heard of robert evans anxiously awaiting a no so i could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity he replied you mean bob evans yes indeed it seems he knows everybody my father had come across him in his days as a buyer for macy s i asked do you know what he does now he s some sort of movie director or something now isn t he dad answered i bought him the audiobook evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name his voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess he also lent his voice to the short lived hysterically irreverent cartoon series kid notorious that still airs on comedy central all in all whether you know evans or not this is a fascinating beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than thalberg s and selznick s combined the story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on this is a must see for anyone interested in tinseltown ps i don t usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc what a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody ask your dad who knows	positive

i liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times i like to watch any movie that involves gangs \( especially bloods crips \) so i can learn from them if you re looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies you may not want this one in your collection becuase to me it doesn t show enough bloods crips in it the characters are fictional there are some minor gangs in it as well called the white fences \( latino hispanic gang i ve never heard of this gang so i don t know if they are true or not \) the actors who play the gang members of the white fences are good actors though i think they are better then don cheadle and wayans who play crip members this movie centers more on white fence and their rivalry w crips there s not too much focus on bloods in here it also more focuses on sean penn s character and robert duvall too \( good cop bad cop \) and penn on how he falls in love w a former gangmember woman in the white fence gang colors is a good watch i just wish it had more gang focus in it and more gang sets \( chapters i e eight tray gangsters hoover etc \) if you re looking for a good gang buy buy the book monster by sanyika shakur a k a monster kody scott or do or die by leon bing those 2 books far surpasses this movie	positive

i expected so much more from this movie i guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors \( jolie washington \) and also had the always on point queen latifah as well i watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie but i walked away bitter with shattered expectations first off i will say that latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason i smiled on occasion during this movie experience washington and jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable \( especially washington who really strained in this role \) that i was constantly asking myself do i really like these two and i had to remind myself of movies like gia and training day to answer with a resounding yes the film follows a rookie cop \( jolie \) as she helps a quadriplegic ex cop lincoln \( washington \) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called the bone collector the ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer while not who you d pinpoint is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever it s like oh so he she did it interesting and i m bored i d skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling	negative

i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star sorry i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was overdone too much blood killing and the like it was totally historically inaccurate and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar yet he does not even load it either time and somehow without even aiming the canon he knocks his friend off his horse the movie is a failure f a i l u r e crappy junky just plain dumb stupid pathetic i am not going to waste any more words on it just whatever you do save your money don t buy it it s not worth 50 cents	negative

the movies of course are dated but fascinating also the picture quality was excellent as was the sound the main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed now even the simplest movie regardless of the subject has an edge these horror movies of the 40s 50s are gentler less scary with a clear statement of good and evil now we view things differently without any absolute judgments clarity has given way to a more unsettled world	positive
okay the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful the only good thing going for this movie was the return of snake plissken this film s plot was essentially a rehash of the original escape from new york a bit more special effects \( which in fact did not make this a better movie \) when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character characters kurt russell s character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them obviously the movie doesn t really know where it s going as it takes two scenes \( 15 minutes of the film \) \( 1st scene president commandant and lackey give snake the mission \) \( 2nd scene commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission \) to explan to the audience what s the basic conflict i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer carpenter russell please don t tell me money caused you to revisit a cult figure some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson stacy keach steve buscemi and pam grier robertson keach and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters sorry snake i don t love l a the big green pointy eared one	negative
i was like the previous reviewer i had rented it and after watching it the first time purchased it before i had even returned the rental i loved the content it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience how lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine waiting to be returned to and i didn t learn this fact from the video i have been studying this subject for many years and already believe no i know that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on earth this video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true home people who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come my own mother saw her mother as she died she came to take her home there is no specific religion addressed here only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying and that it is something to be totally unafraid of in fact physical death is only the beginning of something great it is a step in the evolution of our souls	positive

china the panda adventure is an imax film that tells a story so in a sense the pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary the story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving ruth harkness who has arrived in china to take care of the business affairs of her late husband her husband it seems was a great admirer of the giant panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them this leads ruth to seek these pandas out to see for herself as the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of china the cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well ruth is played by the lovely maria bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the panda all in all this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family but be warned it s more of a story involving the panda and not a documentary	positive

you can tell your life is really pathetic when ghosts have to show you how to live but that is what happens to cosmo topper in the charming topper and its equally charming sequel topper returns it s basically your typical screwball comedy \( complete with cary grant \) but with an injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery in other words it s loads of fun george and marion kirby \( cary grant constance bennett \) love fun partying until clubs kick them out and generally not taking life seriously so it s a shock to them when they die in a car accident and linger on as ghosts apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the great beyond so when george s boss cosmo topper \( roland young \) crashes his new car in the same spot the kirbys take him under their wing poor cosmo is stodgy and timid with a domineering wife who schedules his day down to the minute so it s up to the kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun but their good deed rapidly gets away from them and most sequels stink but goofy murder mystery topper returns is just as funny as the first movie instead of a ghostly screwball this time it s a spoof of haunted house stories with a nod to hitchcock s rebecca ann carrington \( carole landis \) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance with cheeky pal gail \( joan blondell \) in tow but after the girls switch bedrooms someone murders gail confused she drifts over to the house of cosmo topper \( roland young \) whose car she hijacked earlier in the day gail blackmails topper into helping her discover who murdered her and who is trying to kill ann now the unfortunate topper must somehow solve the mystery despite a small army of creepy servants a house full of secret passages and vicious seals and his upset wife searching high and low for him based on thorne smith s novels topper and topper returns even had a spinoff tv series which was nowhere near as good as the movies and those movies are charming and still fresh especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories but it s the little touches that make this movie hilarious for example there s george laughing on a chandelier and gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body not to mention that vicious seal the comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film but no less entertaining but at the same time these movies are graced by tender moments between george and marion and a truly exquisite scene where gail s ghost wanders out the window into the sky and i m still not sure how that invisible person under the covers shot was done especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s roland young is the star of the piece his topper is timid halting and has his day scheduled down to the minute not a single spark of sponteneity grant comes across like a trickster god and has wonderful chemistry with bennett and blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl topper and topper returns are decades old but are perfect examples of hollywood classics charming chipper and hilarious	positive

until sam raimi made spider man i think we all regarded tim burton s batman as the best superhero movie \( even though i actually don t consider batman to be a superhero because he has no superpowers \) burton directed this movie and did a great job this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then michael keaton is batman bruce wayne needless to say batman is wayne s alter ego keaton is magnificent at playing the character s alter ego keaton also does a good job playing the character when he s not in costume keaton s bruce wayne isn t as gloomy as christian bale s was in batman begins which isn t necessarily a bad thing but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies but overall bale s bruce wayne is superior to keaton s because bale has a much more developed character to play however keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale the problem with this movie is that the joker \( jack nicholson \) steals the show the whole movie revolves around him so this isn t batman s movie this movie should have been called the joker so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton now you know the thing is the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality and they barely scratch the surface of the character s background we know practically nothing about wayne you d think the guy that s batman wouldn t be so uninteresting but we re bored to tears everytime wayne s onscreen \( and out of costume \) but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes he plays an even more menacing batman than bale so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton but keaton didn t have anything to work with so it s not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak but one of the strengths of keaton s performance is that if you ever met wayne he d seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman that s something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish but thankfully bale was able to do it michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred it s hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years i assumed michael caine s alfred wouldn t compare to gough s but i was wrong they re both great pat hingle was really good \( as commissioner gordon \) in this movie hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series and i enjoyed them both in batman returns but in batman forever i didn t like them nearly as much and in batman robin i found their characters annoying as hell vicki vale s \( kim basinger \) investigation into bruce wayne s background is completely uninteresting but i already knew what she would find out so maybe that s why i didn t like those scenes i also found the vicki character annoying screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen there s lots of little things i love in this movie the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him \( and the terrified expression of the gunmen \) with elfman s dramatic music blaring the look on napier s face when he sees the emptied safe when the guy got fried by the joker s joy buzzer \( one of the worst deaths i ve ever seen in a movie \) when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise and the joker s speech right before a mob boss dies the first action news report of the movie the way urgent is written in messy crayon on the parcel when batman jumps through the skylight \( accompanied by elfman s music \) the design of the batmobile minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave \( again elfman s music is awesome \) the grin on the young jack napier the batmobile attacking the chemical factory the joker s facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd when the bat signal is lit but it s not as awesome as the first time it s lit in batman returns or when it s lit at the end of mask of the phantasm and now a few complaints this movie featured too many songs by prince after a while they get unbearably annoying there were lots of other great 80s pop songs that could have \( and should have \) been used in this movie another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring by the way you can tell that nicholson s make up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking burton s batwing is cooler than schumacher s batwing \( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm \) anyway the targeting system of burton s batwing seems a little screwed up batman has a big red target locked on the joker but the plane s missiles and machine guns miss their target and the joker didn t even try to get out of the way looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems i always overlooked this movie s flaws \( until i saw batman begins \) for two reasons first of all i found keaton s batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie second of all the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is pretty much everytime the joker or the batman aren t onscreen the movie is boring but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie

well at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit based on a book written on 1902 it s nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward but also his future wife he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date to our more contemporary \( and one hopes more enlightened \) attitudes there s no post colonial guilt here whatsoever in some ways this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material in another way it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie all of this wouldn t matter much if the movie was entertaining unfortunately it is only intermittently so	negative

this film does not come close to the quality of once upon a time in china first of all the plot is weak it does not have the kind of power that the original of this series did the characters in this film seem like they are out of a comic book while the characters in the first film were interesting and complex the kungfu is mostly unrealistic wirework and while once upon a time in china had some of this the emphasis was on realistic martial arts in the original the main characters were trying to resist the influence of the west which was destroying their culture but in this version the main characters are actually on the side of the westerners and they are fighting their own people there is no explanation of why wong fei hung and his crew would side with the people who were their enemies in the last film one of the reasons the original film was so good was because it was about brave chinese patriots trying to protect their culture but in this film is seems as though they have switched sides	negative
i haven t seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block busters i had to rent it my favorite part is when tom essex played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw the head and the head said get that damn screwdriver out of my head i couldn t stop laughing it was so funny i never really liked many horror comedy movies but this one is really good the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook he was not only funny but he was very brave and sexy to boot if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing he makes me want to watch it over and over and over again	positive
so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995 this movie and mira sorvino s performance in it was so bad that after it was over i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category let s see according to wikipedia they were kathleen quinlin \( apollo 13 a fairly standard worried wife of astronaut in danger role \) mare winningham \( georgia did not see this one \) joan allen \( nixon did not see but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon \) and kate winslet \( sense and sensibilities did not see either but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also \) it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today s hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance and i was beginning to warm up to her too she was great in romy and michele s high school reunion and terrific also in beautiful girls so what exactly is so bad about this movie here s a brief list 1 mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard maybe in 1995 because she was new the academy didn t realize that this wasn t her real voice and took pity on her 2 stupid plot device of the greek chorus 3 stupid happy ending with a twist 4 lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies while this movie is not itself a porn flick the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch 5 odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen \( with dyed hair and bald spot \) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters all right so i m just jealous woody still looks gross 6 cliched poorly developed characters a plotline that goes around in circles and lots and lots of pointless unfunny dialogue in summary this movie is bad bad bad	negative
i had high hopes for this series when i started watching it though i guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover shandala is truly a wonderful character pure and good and the characterization of her is very tender so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting oh how wrong of me to think so because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings the message of hope the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain s demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the truth is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent good woman is the only way to save the world spare me and if you think that i am disgusted by this message just imagine what the muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the koran and the muslim character s final opinions although the story is technically good i m only giving it one star for the message of despair	negative
the only reason i m reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on so no let s be fair i did enjoy analyze this i really did though it wasn t a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life or even for the rest of the day and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie i didn t have very high expectations though because i rarely expect too much of sequels once again i was proven right analyze that illustrates perfectly why sequel sounds like such a dirty word the original film had a spark of originality the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again but of course that could never work it s the same problem with almost every comedic sequel those who haven t seen the original wouldn t understand the jokes and those who have already heard them before and that is why they fail time after time so what does this movie have a great comedic duo a couple of really funny guys yeah and fathers day had an even better pair look what happened to that a couple of good mafia jokes sure sure i even cracked a smile on several occasions but that isn t enough there are thousands of comedy films out there not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable and producers think they ll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas newsflash think again nobody watches these movies there s no reason to when you can just watch the original again	negative
i like this video for it s frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself like yoga it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it the energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches the quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm i found that in itself very interesting and different it is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like she shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing a mind bender so to speak and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it	positive

warning spoilers abound okay folks i was flipping channels and came across a movie called the hole starring thora birch keira knightley and desmond harrington now aside from this terrible blunder i m going to tell you about in just a few more sentences the film was fairly entertaining i dig thora birch and her character was really well played what really shocked me though was my quick research after the film was over i mean i checked imdb rotten tomatoes and wikipedia although all reputable sources none mentioned this ridiculous mistake have you ever been so utterly sure of something so blantantly painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an entirely different alien planet to be able to even minutely comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents that s how i felt after watching this movie and realizing that apparently i m the only goddamn human being on this prosaic infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for what it was and what exactly was this stupendous error you ask well it s very simple i mean it couldn t get more common sensically moronic than this the basic plot of the film is four teenagers trapped in an old war bunker the movie begins with thora birch s rendition of what happened that her friend set this whole thing up locked them in the hole and didn t come back when he was supposed to she escapes and the three others die the story changes from what she originally told her psychiatrist to what actually happened turns out the only way out was actually locked from the inside and thora had the key the whole time the other teenagers die for various reasons irrelevant to the blunder at hand and she ends up telling the tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker in the end she kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him the police come and find thora and her psychiatrist in the hole and after rebuking the psychiatrist mention that the case is now closed at that moment a flashback shows thora murdering her friend that set everything up and planting the key on him right after that moment i said to myself what the heck the door locks from the inside it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that either a \) the door was never locked or b \) someone had to unlock it from the inside alright those weren t my exact words but good god it s so obvious and that my friends has got to be possibly the worst film blunder ever	negative

all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane s life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane s life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is at best an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice accused murder suspect in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane s extracurricular activities my interest in the film was as a hogan s heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six year series bob crane s professional credits alone would make for a good film auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane s so called secret life and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane s private life auto focus however should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan s heroes television series	negative
while the story may be entertaining in its own right and any chance to see donald o conner dance is worth it this can be a very disappointing film to porter buffs the plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship the story line is totally different and therefore some of porter s original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of sammy cahn and james van huesen which do not live up to porter s quality the best examples i can give is the fact that there is no evangelist so the title song anything goes turns into a second act number sung by mitzi and chorus \( with horrific word changes \) and blow gabriel blow becomes a finale in the broadway show \( sung by the four main characters \) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line if you haven t seen it on stage it s pleasant enough but if you re expecting the broadway show it s a major disappointment	negative
this dvd possesses some of the best editing and production that i have yet to see in a child development product each of the sections \( cognitive physical and language \) is well researched it s easy to understand and highly accessible just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development	positive

obviously the music featured here is of high quality hardly sign of the times transcendent but nonetheless very exciting \( as was typical of prince s 2002 tour \) unfortunately the director does his her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound hamfisted camera angle switches bizarre washed out colors some horribly cheesy effects and cuts for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity it s a shame the director clearly hasn t the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber hey prince just so you know your diy npgmc approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you d been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you if it looks this amateurish then you just look well amateurish and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur level presentation the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this i mean really you re shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam antwerp footage was not up to par i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this but casual fans \( especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert \) should definitely avoid	negative
there are no words to describe how awful \( \) this movie was from beginning to end but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day evening from being ruined the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is touched by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle need i say more the plot the humor the dialogues and the music are way beyond below average there is next to no nudity and there are no i mean 0 as in zero beautiful girls in this film as for the acting oh my the acting is beyond words school plays \( and pre school for that matter \) have better actors it is truly sad rent or buy \( ha ha ha \) at your own risk you have been warned	negative
i think that anyone who believes this movie to be hilarious or hudson s performance overrated and over the top in her singing just doesn t like musicals or perhaps doesn t like an all black cast \( i am not black \) or is too young to understand the 60 s world of music and payola and backstabbing while touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by the supremes with diana ross as its lead singer it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others the key words here are loosely based on the story of the supremes why people including ross herself don t get that is beyond me over the top if anyone saw the original play with jennifer holliday \( i did see it \) then you don t know the meaning of over the top that character was supposed to be that way and hudson did a wonderful job of that her performance overrated hogwash she deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever beyonce s performance was good but not great this was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play this was beyonce s best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the right role this was not the right role for her in my opinion hudson s character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the supporting actress win though as lead actress she probably would have lost you people out there don t take my word for this movie s greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was white washed no pun intended or don t think its a bad movie like some other critics here you must judge for yourself i hope and think that you won t be disappointed there are some more than subtle references to the supremes and diana ross especially in some of the costumes beyonce s images and album covers \( cd covers for you youngsters \) but only die hard fans of the supremes and people who were there at that time would know that enjoy	positive

the basic pilates mat exercises are performed which are okay however the cardio segment of this video is truly lame the instructor runs the viewer through marching marching and stretching one s arm at the same time and finally marching and kicking back one s leg that s it how incredibly dull what s worse the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration pilates for dummies is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates \( do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio \) i wouldn t waste your time w this video	negative

i saw this movie for one reason i wanted to see gerard butler in something other than phantom of the opera just to see how he played a normal role i ve never been a big fan of chick flicks \( for instance my friend and i watched a walk to remember awhile ago and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room \) that said dear frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored initially i had trouble understanding what the actors were saying \( they all have thick accents \) but once i got used to it i had no problems through the rest of the movie	positive
as the other reviewers make clear this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ruined her so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation problem is having just watched the movie i am not convinced there is anything below the surface prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy \( as fantasy it is \) is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility not that i can see	negative
ok check it out there s two jack blacks one is the guy from tenacious d you see him all the time he s funny and childish and insane then there s the other jack black he s the evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal and king kong whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident well as long as you aren t fat and don t feel patronized by gweneth presuming to know what it s like not to be desired all her life \( ha \) then by all means suspend all disbelief logic and brain power and watch this dumb movie gweneth s fat suit is actually pretty convincing although most of the movie she s played by an actual fat chick who by the way should have just been left in without the whole ha ha the dude thinks she s skinny nonsense obviously a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if a \) he weren t brainwashed b \) his fat girlfriend wasn t replaced by a twiggy blond chick c \) the movie didn t throw ridiculous concepts your way \( like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it \) d \) tony robbins was in no way involved whatsoever i knew i was slumming it when i saw this movie but i m not sure what the message of this film is jack black s character is decent considerate great with kids and perfect in every way oh except he s really shallow for no dicernable reason other than his dad s dying words were for him to go out and chase tail the weird part is that hal s not a bad person the movie beats you over the head showing you he s the nicest guy on on the face of the earth so you can t really laugh at him looking like an idiot rosemary is so fat she has superpowers her butt actually creates typhoons \( i wonder if that has military applications \) suddenly hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews tony robbins brainwashed him the fiend when hal finally realizes this he decides to \( ooh big spoiler \) love rosemary anyway and learns a valuble lesson along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he s dating rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non judgemental he is dating a fat girl \( cause that would make any woman melt \) of course there s requisite best friend played by jason alexander who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get hal to dump her then again the friend is a complete troll so i don t know why hal would want him around and to insult us further they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a serious note about how true beauty is on the inside too many public service messages pick one but brain dead writing aside paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit \( despite gweneth s postering when this film was first released \) regardless of its clumsy benevolence i have to rate this as a romantic comedy and for that i give it a rating of totally unremarkable nice gesture farelly brothers not to be bothered with	negative
this just to voice my opinion on the new ran transfer while i agree it is an improvement over the atrocious fox lorber edition \( which is not that great an achievement considering the fox lorber dvd was one of the worst products in the history of home entertainment \) this tranfer is still a long way from doing this masterpiece justice yes the colors are vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and the heavy edge enhancement \( straight from hell \) doesn t make it any better i have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or 40 years older than ran but look far better the problem becomes very obvious when one watches this dvd via progressive component output on a large screen a video tape was used as a master \( and a poor one at that \) the only way to restore such an important movie properly and thereby finally showing mr kurosawa the respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital transfer off an original film negative before applying filters or any enhancements why this opportunity was \( again \) wasted here escapes me totally and angers me very much another problem seems to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video which is in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer for my part i would much sooner live with a bit of visible film grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a saucy soft picture without much bite and detail there is no excuse for posting such an objectively false statement and yes the packaging is a liability my dvds must have been bobbing about in there all the way across the atlantic and looked accordingly shocking i would have gladly payed twice the price if they had kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important thing right the image quality of ran like this i m very disappointed	negative
for ina claire ninotchka was a last chance to show posterity what she could do for there wouldn t be many film opportunities offered her she d been a leading lady of the stage for nigh on thirty years and her elegant beauty very much a high bred dina merrill type look was still aglow she was one of carl van vechten s favorite subjects and he took photo after photo of her staring imperiously against a wall of baize or reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde hair she suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at mgm when her part in i take this woman was taken away from her and given to the cheaper verree teasdale her director josef von sternberg was also let go and in fact the whole picture was redone so many times studio wags called it i re take this woman the woman in question was hedy lamarr after ina claire s hilarious showdowns with garbo in ninotchka the studio might have thought her perfect for the part of lamarr s central european rival a year or so later and edmund goulding put her to work as dorothy mcguire s mother in the charming underrated claudia but that is definitely a mother part and as such put an end to ina claire s film career as the countess swana she gets lots of billy wilder s best lines and laughs she s not afraid of anyone much less garbo much has been written about the chemistry between garbo and melvyn douglas indeed a delightful mix but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without swana s steely icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations in real life ina claire lived on to a great old age she was 92 when the last curtain fell for her and here in san francisco where she spent most of her life all the lights in her building went off for an hour precisely at 8 30 while her fans stood on the street devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans surrounding the dakota hotel when john lennon died	positive

i m told by fellow film enthusiasts that bu uel s later films do not show this spanish master at his best that his earliest films his famous collaborations with salvador dal for instance show an edgier more fascinating bu uel whatever i saw his 1974 film the phantom of liberty for the first time recently and i immediately fell in love with it there are those who swear by his more popular 1972 oscar winner the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie but somehow i think the phantom of liberty is even more entertaining than discreet charm there is no plot to speak of in phantom this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds bu uel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images monks pray for a woman s sick father and then play poker with the woman and smoke a group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets and go to the bathroom to eat in private two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter even though she s right there in class when they call her name in the universe bu uel concocts in the phantom of liberty anything goes the amazing thing about this movie is that instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches the phantom of liberty has a broad theme to support its free form structure it s bu uel s comic vision of freedom run amuck sure the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone but as bu uel seems to be suggesting even freedom has its limits the opening scene of the movie is set in toledo spain in 1808 as napoleon s troops attempt to liberate the spanish and are greeted with cries of down with liberty there can be times when we want the assurance of authority rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please bu uel doesn t take a stand one way or the other really he s just an artist who is intrigued by the idea and his interest fuels the free form structure of the film and its content almost anything and everything he can think of within the bounds i suppose of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career is thrown into this movie and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure i found its elegant chaos exhilarating only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this i think bu uel pulls it off triumphantly here somehow he makes the movie seem almost logical the way it progresses the phantom of liberty is a sheer delight highly recommended	positive
this movie is all about entertaining the combination between die hard and typical martial arts flick works in many levels but the production values are hong kong s don t miss that point fans of jet li are welcome but action fans be careful here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames exploding building models chopped off dummies you name it the characters are extreme in their own context jet li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor loyal gentleman honorable deadly you know a portrait of the typical good guy the bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking he doesn t fight or kick much in this film but he shoots a lot dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator that happens to be be the right size well you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes but if you are into hong kong low production values action films you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the 90 s by the way this dvd edition sucks english dubbed subtitles poor sound and no extras not even a filmography	positive

this is the 2000 or so version of the dvd this is identical with the vhs version except it adds two features the first is an excellent making of video from 1996 which was re done with a different host for 2006 but all the interview segments are the same the second was a making of video done for the dvd which doesn t add a whole lot were i to do it again i d buy this version and skip the 2006 50th anniversary release this is the classic chuck jones television grinch in one of the best packages for it and the horton hears a who is also a chuck jones classic a person s a person no matter how small	positive
much of the plot has been outlined above as well as the cast and i am in large part in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded i want to add that for anyone raised on the old universal horror pictures or the films directed by james whale or val lewton where the suspense is the important part of the film this picture shadows and fog has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame despite the comedic elements \( and there are many funny things happening \) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative the climax is dissapointing for many but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways i have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse oblique writings of hegel kant and the like i beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see bananas or sleeper love him or hate him you have to admit woody allen is deep a personal favorite film of mine but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea	positive

this very b grade horror film left alot to be desired aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix there wasnt much to make this unrated if your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity forget it the nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin klein undies however if your someone who likes to use your imagination this might be for you one good thing about this flick is a pre charmed hottie drew fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies if your a big drew fan like me it might be worth buying utherwise go buy a playgirl	negative
alfred hitchcock s second film after being brought to america by david o selznick was suspicion which he made while on loan to rko pictures as in his first hollywood flick rebecca he put joan fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star fontaine won the best actress academy award for her portrayal of lina mclaidlaw a bookish and innocent \( but wealthy \) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish johnnie aysgarth \( cary grant \) after their quick courtship and marriage against her father s wishes lina begins to see johnnie for who he really is a penniless leech but she naively continues to love him nonetheless johnnie s charm is ostensible yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable lina s trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture the movie s only flaw is its tacked on and seemingly contrived final scene which we are told was due either to mr grant s popularity during these years or to the existence of the production code in effect in hollywood at that time hitchcock wanted a darker ending but as we see here he lost that battle however he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe the ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities suspicion is classic hitchcock grant and fontaine turn in masterful performances and nigel bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable beaky johnnie s old chum the flawed ending prevents placing suspicion at the top of any list of hitchcock s achievements but it is a fine film nevertheless and i can only give it my highest recommendation jeremy w forstad	positive

flying down to rio is the film that marks the first pairing of ginger rogers and fred astaire the two are not the main attraction though the film stars dolores del rio and gene raymond in a tempestuous love affair raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women del rio is engaged to a man in rio de janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the american in a back and forth romance the two occupy plenty of the film the rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including i like music the carioca and orchids in the moonlight on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes the cast is good and the story is pretty standard but it is the music that spices up the film definitly take a look at this movie which is filled with inuendo only pre code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured	positive

if there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was history of violence on critics top ten list everyone was talking about the performances of viggo and maria and ed so i went into it with high expectations honestly it wasn t horrible but it wasn t worth all the worship that the hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either the story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of ed harris who in my opinion had the best performance overall ed \( mr fogarty \) is in the mob and seems to think that viggo \( tom \) is joey cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge tom and his wife edie \( played by maria bello \) have two children a farmhouse and a diner and tom insist that he isn t joey the story goes on dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex maria bello has never been one of my favorite actresses i think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair \( evidence is in the movie \) she brings the level of believability down and makes viggo s performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent we soon figure out that tom is indeed joey and after we say goodbye to ed harris s character \( of which i was just disappointed to see c mon he was awesome \) tom joey goes to see his brother richie \( william hurt \) to make amends for disappearing and soon realizes that richie wants him dead so more killing more blood and tom joey is finally free of his past if his family would take him back of course they do really his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table \( his daughter sets a place for him \) and the movie is over there was no aha moment the action wasn t anything new the story was predictable and the setting was been there done that viggo is an amazing actor and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the tom joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into the shift of reality was barely noticeable maria bello needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough sexy stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly it doesn t work for her she cannot pull it off so i don t recommend this movie its slow its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be	negative

the essence of painter francis bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life seen through his central nervous system and eyes we experience his world of fragments like collage pieces of existence the only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting otherwise he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being himself together tellingly one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one on one job with his lover george in his paintings of george however he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with george that sums up bacon his art and his life in a nutshell bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art yet he is also the most alone person imaginable something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay one of the very best films about an artist ever made you don t need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here if you want to see his paintings you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute or less using any visual search engine	positive
what a huge disappointment this release is i was suspecting that it wouldn t be all that great when i saw that the studio that originally produced this show 20th century fox was the same video company releasing it well the first season looks horrible the source material is all 16mm dupe prints some parts of which are out of focus scratched and dirty in all cases the image is soft and well like 16mm compared to what fox is releasing of voyage to the bottom of the sea produced the same year \( 1964 \) and at the same studio as boone this release is nothing short of a disgrace we should be given pristine 35mm source material and we re not i suspect fox wouldn t release the original camera negs from it s vaults without a substantial fee anyway season one of daniel boone isn t worth buying i haven t seen season two when the show started filming in color but i m now afraid to look	negative
really not worth the effort to find it even if george macdonald fraser was involved with the screenplay the producers chose the least best of the flashman novels to adapt they cast the wrong actor to play the role and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy not very funny slapstick comedy don t bother searching for it true flashman fans will be disappointed	negative
200 american is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy even though it looks like a no budget episode of queer as folk or intended to be a gay version of pretty woman it s got a pretty good story it doesn t rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography most of the actors are straight playing gay roles i was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show something that i can certainly relate to the acting is acceptable but not great because most of the actors are not that experienced i was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer the movie has some kind of charm about it perhaps it s because it s so sincere and gimmick free and even the love scenes are very low key i was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss there is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor it s very captivating sean matic did a good job with his light austrilian accent by the way it s worth rental fee for sure	positive
i really enjoyed goodbye lenin and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that i decided to watch this one the film follows three idealistic politically right on young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking selfish and uncaring bourgeois consumer society this rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses moving their furniture around and leaving notes like you are too wealthy very situationist \( never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into \) all this is fine and well but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich ignorant bourgeois pig in the first ten minutes or so i thought this might be a clever bit of directing in which we view society as seen through their eyes rather than society in its reality however this wasn t to be the case the world remained bourgeois the kids are alright the older generation bourgeoise are bare cyphers and none \( with the exception of the man they kidnap \) is given anything like a personality when a break in goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there and take him away to a shack in the hills during this time they decide to educate him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man s part in them the rich man barely challenges the young people at all and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong the anti capitalist argument running through the entire film is very one sided i could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced but this wasn t furthermore there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work the edukators are young good looking and artistic the subtext being that because they are arty they can see things that others can t at one point one of the characters is on a bus when three men \( presumably police though its not made clear \) hassle a drunk for not having a ticket the character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone gives the drunk his ticket and gets off the bus do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police can t say that s my experience amybe they do in germany this is a recurring problem with the film situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic the anarchist marxist anti capitalist dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless by the end of the film you don t actually know what exactly they stand for or what their solutions are to the problems of society basically the one sided political argument hamstrings the characters development their views are never challenged so they don t change it is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film the ending is also unbeleivably cynical and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film generally it feels like a script written by a 1st year politics student being so utterly simplistic in it s the rich are all bad message i would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society but at the same time i wouldn t recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world s problems there has been a rash of good political films lately good night and good luck syriana the constant gardener unfortunately and given so much potential this film is not one of them shame	negative

every time this movie comes on my husband \( who is english \) and i watch it and laugh our heads off if you have ever been in an english train station drinking weak watery cups of tea out of dirty cracked cups smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there and not to be crule but these are not exactly a couple of sex pots the thought of two stodgy old english people being driven wild by their passion for each other is well hilarious i give it 5 stars for being so darn funny oh and the music please but it is worth watching for a good laugh	positive

the synopsis sam and jonah baldwin father and son have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of chicago they move to seattle eighteen months later jonah can sense that his dad is still sad and in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self help guru on christmas eve to wish for his father a new wife annie reed lives in baltimore and is engaged to walter their relationship while loving and comfortable is entirely devoid of romantic sparks when annie hears jonah s soulful plea on the radio it s as if her heart has been touched by magic and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to sam and his son even if it means traveling across like 26 states the critique sleepless in seattle is a brilliantly simple film that s what makes it so great to quote nora ephron it isn t a movie about love it s a movie about love in the movies to emphasize this point she incorporates various parallel references to an affair to remember throughout the film but sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love \( which let s admit it have been undeniably shaped by what we ve seen on the silver screen \) the script is refreshingly candid yet endearing and nora ephron s direction is impeccable ross malinger cast as jonah baldwin is the youngest and most notable talent in the film he does an excellent job of portraying the quintessential eight year old he s impulsive moody and thinks he knows it all \( i speak from experience here folks i currently have a son that age \) he and tom hanks come together flawlessly as father and son so successfully in fact that they would be utterly convincing off screen the chemistry between meg ryan and tom hanks is equally amazing which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene the supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes rosie o donnell bill pullman rita wilson rob reiner david hyde pierce and a young gaby hoffmann families with younger children will appreciate the film s integrity there is very little foul language \( god damn it and it scared the shit out of me being the worst of it \) and no sexual content to be wary of all around this is a winning film one that i find myself watching over and over and over again the dvd for a 10th anniversary edition the special features are few and rather disappointing you ve got your basic director commentary a music video \( when i fall in love by celine dion clive griffin \) and a love in the movies featurette this last piece is approximately 15 minutes long it features the director producers actors and the hosts of loveline drew pinsky and adam carolla \( why they are included i don t know \) talking about love in the movies there are some interesting interview segments with an empire state building historian and some very beautiful shots of the new york skyline before 9 11 but there s certainly nothing here to write home about by far the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio \( and honestly how exciting is that \) this a dvd that you buy for the film alone	positive

my major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires these extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u v lamp vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun vampires are supposed to be scary but how frightened of them should i be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable the first underworld movie would be a good model	negative
this mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny considering the comedic caliber of its two stars billy crystal and robin williams i was expecting a laugh riot but that s not what this is it s not their fault it s the scriptwriter s i guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper but that humor just didn t translate to the screen despite the best efforts of mssrs crystal and williams they deserve better and so do we	negative
never in my life have i seen a film dedicated to the subject of vichy france i had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government i assumed that the sorrow and the pity was strictly a documentary about the french resistance but was pleasantly surprised by its depth it describes the vichy of petain and laval quite thoroughly you may recognize some of ophuls interviewees from the world at war \( such as edward spears \) but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the ss i assume he served in the charlemagne outfit frankly i was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face his point that the slaughter of 1 600 french sailors by the english was a motivating force for him to join the germans was something i would have never considered it seems inconceivable back then for the french to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than england given the competition but it is clear that anglophobia was rampant after the rout of may 1940 the most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists it seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed petain \( at first \) and looked sympathetically to the nazis the speeches the newsreels and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting especially if you re a history buff i d rank this one right up there with hotel terminus	positive
scratching deeper beyond the surface one can find return of the seven to be significantly different from its predecessor the magnificent seven it is much more than a thematically framed sequel which it can easily be mistaken for return of the seven is a dark film and it does not offer the hope of a truly optimistic future for any of its characters in this respect it is a complete inversion of the magnificent seven through their catharsis in the original we saw an attempt at redemption through an act of nobility on the part of the seven they truly were noble and i believe were redeemed for their transgressions as gunmen some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not that film had to end as it did with the seven ultimately all committed to their singular code of ethics and morality in an emotionally charged finale in this film there is very little emotion on the surface instead director burt kennedy gives us a thought provoking study into the human psyche and the very nature of defeatism of the human spirit in this film there are no pretensions on the part of the seven for most of them this is just another gun job there are no higher aspirations that they are cognizant of if it were not this job it would be the next to tell his story burt kennedy focuses almost entirely on the character of chris the leader perfectly portrayed again by yul brynner this is not really a tale of the seven instead kennedy uses brynner with all his aplomb and apparent stoicism to curiously examine and probe the motivations of the other six lorca the villain \( pompously played by mexican director emilio fernandez \) and several other key characters in effect kennedy takes what was apparently a happy or satisfactory ending from the magnificent seven and asks what if what if 10 years later the remaining characters are not so contented as prior events led us to believe they would be would friends be willing go up against innumerable odds would strangers once again sign on to go up against those same innumerable odds do the strong still have to help the weak and who really are the strong and the weak when 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away chico \( julian mateos \) and other mexican farmers from surrounding villages chris and vin \( robert fuller \) agree to come to his aid however it is chris alone that recruits the members of the seven this time out kennedy singularly endows chris a sense of morality and level headedness in this film that comes from his wisdom and manner of nobility in effect this is brynner s film all the way just as john sturges directorial style was so smooth that his own storytelling glossed right over the depth and complexity of his own work so is burt kennedy s however kennedy is challenged with a very dark and brooding tale to tell where sturges the magnificent seven could easily have been taken on a purely action film level and still been successful kennedy does not have that luxury kennedy has to deliver an action film built on previous events and he also has to approach the story from a different perspective to remain fresh yet keep it thematically to the concept of the original seven not an easy task if the viewer does not look deeply into this film it may just appear as a well produced dud however i believe kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations the more times i view this film again it comes back to brynner he makes members of the seven \( vin chico and colbee \) all come to realizations about themselves with his subtle yet profound dialogue he gives riker and luis a chance at redemption even though both men come from total opposites of the spectrum he helps the failed priest rise from his failures at least as far as his knees chris even gives lorca the villain a chance to ride out because when chris was younger he gave him the same chance however chris refuses to let lorca now bathe his personal grief as an ineffectual father in other men s blood yet even lorca is literally redeemed by the end of the film when petra tells chris that the farmers will never forget them he simply replies that s all a man can ask that is the mystique and legacy of the seven even the character of chris is endowed with human flaws he recklessly took on the young manuel rounding out the seven for luck with tragic results and we see brynner deeply grieved on the screen this is a film of hard lessons learned technically this is a well made film the cinematography is full of crane dolly and tracking shots which gives it both perspective and movement bernstein s score is full and lush and this is the single cohesive element that keeps the seven together the set designs are dark grim and rustic giving the film a pensive psychological depth the payoff for brynner and the viewer comes in the final shot looking at the farmers rebuilding the village he comments i ll be damned vin looks at him and responds i doubt that i doubt that very much they both ride off they just don t make heroes like that any more	positive
this could have been one of the best films of the 80 s all of the components are there ford gives the best acting of his career the production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today s standards two things however really bring this movie down the major negative here i believe is polanski s insistence on starring emmanuelle seigner this is one of the sexiest women i have ever seen grace a film but it is the understatement of the year to say that she can t act at all in fact i think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance i have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys ford s performance when the film was over i thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here the first half is dynamite the second with seigner is a totally different beast your average stupid kid thriller watch this film and dare contradict my statement here get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part it s so bad that ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in ok the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up there is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where ford and seigner would be time and time again it really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot they were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story i am really kind of mad with polanski here he destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made and this statement comes from one who worships the ground polanski walks on	negative

we expose our babies toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources in several languages therefore having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment \( our little ones are trilingual english spanish and asl and they ignore us in all them \) big mistake the video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other baby einstein \( be \) items in earlier be products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen male hands were never present this video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background or at best an elderly man briefly interacting with a child everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing caring or otherwise being nurturing to children males are only seen \( with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them \) in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes or at least distant dry and quiet poses such as talking with a much older \( male \) child it is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape however as movable and inane as potted plants whom you can move and place at will i felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities asides when you go into the spanish version it is \( for a professionally produced video \) riddled with mistakes three objects are mislabeled in the first when a cup the plastic or paper tall type not the coffee and saucer version it is called la taza when in reality it should be el vaso as unlike english where it is interchangeable vaso is the specific word for that item the second much worse instance still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl there the clueless scripter translated it as el bol a clear and poor corruption of the english word into a one commonly used in spanglish instead of calling it tazo n as its correct name is the last one i saw was in the yard \( i m suprised they didn t call it la yarda looka mami get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas \) this time they called an obvious swing \( two ropes and a seat in between \) la hamaca when in reality hamaca means hammock fortunately we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages in sum i was discusted with the whole thing	negative

i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio	negative

20 minutes into this movie i was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based the actress playing cleopatra protrays her as petulent spoiled and immature whereas in the book one saw cleopatra as highly astute regal and concerned first about her country and its people in the movie she handed egypt to ceasar eagerly whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to rome likewise dalton portrays ceasar as a complete perhaps if this were not based on margaret george s memiors of cleopatra i would be more kind in my review but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second rate film maker s idea of good story telling at 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most but if you really want to learn about this queen read the book instead	negative

how did he have the time to write such a picture to co direct it to act in it and after everything else to write its score noel coward s energies always remarkable were redoubled during the second world war and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing in which we serve is still worth watching but it s nowhere as appealing as either cavalcade or this happy breed and its focus on the life and death of a ship \( the hms torrin \) is strangely monomaniacal almost constructivist over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away symbols of brute strength like something from a soviet film the ship goes up the ship goes down a new ship rises out of the water and in between coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat till our interest settles on three bernard miles as hardy with his striking long hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it he should have played ichabod crane john mills as blake a tiny little pipsqueak who s feisty in the standard mickey rooney jimmy cagney manner and noel coward himself as captain kinross tranquil with class privilege and in the background his glamorous marriage to the ineffable celia johnson \( so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums \) hitchcok s lifeboat had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical but without coward s complicated flashback structure coward stalwarts joyce carey and kay walsh show up as the love interests for miles and mills respectively carey in this movie and in brief encounter as well treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth nor good looking in any way who s given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest she must have kissed the ground every time noel coward walked on it who else would have written such roles for her the movie is trying indeed when it goes serious and yet that s half the fun of it seeing how often coward plays the race card we are an island race indeed i teared up of course i did during the blitz as the v 1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on london households leading to the death of several favorite characters and again when coward leads his naval boys into dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half nude british soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of kool aid outside of these scenes however the movie is marred by its agitprop and by david lean s tiresomeness in showing everything at such a glacial pace ps the film was shot by ronald neame who later became a director himself and whose masterpiece the poseidon adventure sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of in which we serve	positive

phantom quest corp an action comedy film about the drunken karoake singing party girl ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies from dracula to a possessed surgeon mummies and even magical monks this movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events the only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times the series is too short although it was still good the video quality was also pretty nice and subtitles were understandable and on que the plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks but more action and laughs all in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent a great addition to any anime collection	positive

of course dead alive was the better movie but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate due to the fact that there is a high body count lots of over the top splattery deaths and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers some as zombie lunch apparently there was some footage cut out for this release i m not sure if that was gore footage or not but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence there is even some non gore grossout humor \( vomit related etc \) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground but again the influence is unquestionable don t expect the fx quality of dead alive though this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly i don t know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print transfer but it s a minor distraction they did a great job with a relatively small budget i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach s other films on us \( hopefully uncut \) dvd release i ve heard burning moon is especially crazy	positive

seinfeld season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit 1 in the nielsen ratings this was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as jerry elaine george and kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode george s parents frank and estelle costanza as well as jerry s parents morty and helen seinfeld and newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as mr pitt david puddy and kenny bania amazingly the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics and while jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors his work improved a lot during this season disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes the big salad and the pledge drive as well as the hysterical classic the couch the chinese woman and the gymnast are also very good episodes both showing the continuing neuroses of the costanzas the sitcom always seems to have great episodes on disc 2 and this is no exception with the soup the switch where we finally learn kramer s first name and the race all being classic episodes disc 3 is also top notch featuring the excellent the scofflaw the kiss hello and the doorman also known as the bro as well as the two part highlights of 100 episode disc 4 starts out with the classic episode the jimmy which earned michael richards an emmy for best supporting actor the excellent the fusili jerry and the strong season finale the understudy which mirrors the tonya harding nancy kerrigan fiasco only with bette midler of all people playing the victim as usual the extras are just as strong as the episodes the running with the egg featurette that shows how an episode of seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the seinfeld series the bloopers are also very funny from this season especially the ones from the fusili jerry episode the deleted scenes inside looks exclusive stand up material and the notes about nothing are also top notch although not quite on the level of season 4 which was their best season season 6 was another great season for seinfeld as the writing was still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all cylinders highly recommended	positive
this was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film i kept looking at my watch the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about william shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama my girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but i wasn t in the mood she forced me to watch this the film was about a struggling young writer shakespeare played by joseph fiennes who falls in love with lady viola played by gwyneth paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play romeo and juliet this film also won a couple of oscars including gwyny for best actress but i felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old english style thats hard to understand overall the film was just o k i think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and judi dench was great as queen elizabeth but i never want to watch this film again if your a shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than i did	negative
as part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that i have missed over the past few years i came across this clunker i understand of course that i am not the target demographic here most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity unfortunately i was looking for an actual cinematic experience four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named dr von doom \( who wins the award for the most obvious name for a villain ever \) they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers \( now we re talking \) thanks to some chemical filled cloud what follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show we get the thing caving in the front of a semi truck with his shoulder as the money shot but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified an entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers but since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered and succeed destruction for the fans no consequences for the characters but why would director tim story try anyways he knows the people are just showing up to ogle at jessica alba as she pretends to act so instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame he should have just directed a pepsi commercial with jessica alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess the plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble they aren t even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie they go out show off their powers \( in things like extreme sports you know for the kids \) and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough there is also a lackluster love triangle between sue storm \( jessica alba \) reed richards \( ioan gruffudd \) and dr von doom \( julian mcmahon \) i m sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like jessica alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful all wealthy dr von doom but chances are if you re chasing someone that looks like her she s not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career so why is my rating so high above the zero i ve been talking it up to be well it is what it is it didn t put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly it was fun watching tv actors such as michael chiklis and julian mcmahon try their luck at a hollywood blockbuster and at least it wasn t catwoman but what it was was insulting beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe jessica alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid story thinks we are at a newsstand on the cover of people magazine there is a picture of sue storm now if stephen hawkings can t make it to the cover of people then what chance does this two bit scientist have 1 4	negative

they say all the major characters come back in stitch the movie quickly made direct to video sequel to the hugely popular lilo and stitch for me the original film s most appealing part is and will be lilo and stitch one of the most delightful characters disney created in the last decade do we still need pleakley when we have stitch how about cobra or some alien whose name you have forgotten do we need them no i don t think so but stitch the movie crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing the original s idea of ohana or family is changed to cousin this time but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice told story no longer attractive enough what makes us feel short changed is however the lack of music and scenery the impressive parts of lilo and stitch instead of elvis songs they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and tvs like monty python and ed wood completely missing the target audiences who would buy this dvd to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer moreover the charming water color hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic unimaginative backdrop which is barely ok even by the lower standard of the disney s cheap sequels the only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters except that and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair lilo and stitch stitch the movie looks like a pilot film for the original or perhaps it is	negative
i waited over 30 years to see this film and now that i have i m glad i waited that long its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago nicholas alexandra their daughters their son the people surrounding them not only are they not fictional but thanks to the era in which they lived they were photographed we know what they actually looked like so who on earth did the casting it was impossible to tell one grand duchess from another and as for alexandra in the first few scenes i had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag janet suzman was the worst casting flub of all unless you count the stilted manner in which michael jayston delivered his lines what a stiff and boring character he makes nicholas to be yet there are photos extant of nicholas smiling as he played with his children nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as tsar but in the robert massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled it was very clear that nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the russian people as well as to his family and above all his son the future tsar there was nothing exceptional about his behavior most of europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens and to all of them the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable yet this film falls into the trap most of us do of judging history not on the basis of its own terms but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20 20 hindsight having been fed soviet propaganda for 75 years we have it entrenched in our minds that nicholas was an extremely poor ruler that s the stunning success of the massie book that someone who had absolutely no connection to russians and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia was able to overcome the general \( and erroneous \) knowledge of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking the movie on the other hand makes nicholas look petty and alexandra slightly over the edge one petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to nicholas s sending off his troops into world war i it was badly researched to the point of ludicrousness the tsars of russia were all orthodox christians orthodox christianity has its own very distinctive music in fact russian orthodox chant is very different from greek orthodox chant so what kind of background music did the director choose gregorian of course can we at least strive for a little authenticity apparently not massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the romanovs towards their captors how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the bolsheviks you aren t anything like what we thought was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject the movie showed nothing of that well in the end it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the romanov family canonized in the russian orthodox church that movement was well underway by 1971 i wonder if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures all in all purchasing the movie was a waste of money maybe the bolsheviks over at the university s russian department will appreciate my donating it that way others can get to see it without wasting their money	negative
here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made i couldn t believe what i was watching moreover i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema s most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor ralph fiennes how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do entertain sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as the constant gardener it appears that we unfortunate real film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future	negative

the quiet earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below this movie is not the epic thought provoking intelligent sci fi i was led to believe it was it s actually very overrated and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or primer will likely be very disappointed the first 30 minutes or so are jaw dropping i was really getting geared up for what i was sure was going to become one of my all time favorites the scenes of bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet driving around a mall the sun rising to the haunting score all unforgettable the scenes where bruno starts to lose it running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he s their ruler giving them speeches \( that s why i deserve to be president of the quiet earth i ve been condemned to live \) are all great after this point the movie starts to disintegrate and quickly the female character is highly irritating so much so that i think i would have ditched her and looked for other survivors api is also highly irritating and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle my thumbs were pointing down way down something needs to be said about the ending of this film so many people have said that it s deep how is it deep how is it deep when it s just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really doesn t have anything to say let s examine this many people argue the following \( and if they were correct the film would ve been much better than it was \) the main character is a scientist who convinces himself that project flashlight resulted in the effect \( even though others here insist on calling it the event \) which made everyone else disappear the main characters come to believe that the effect didn t snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened but what if there isn t any effect at all what if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there aren t any people the scientist then convinces himself that the effect is going to happen again and understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers daffy annoying woman and a nutty homicidal maniac decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for project flashlight he dies again and ends up on another world one which this time doesn t even resemble earth the end it would have been very clever if this was what was going on if there really wasn t an effect at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died unfortunately all the critics saying they went to another earth where everyone else was gone are forgetting something the dead bodies i know there aren t a lot but remember there s the radiation burn guy in the science station and there s the dead guy on the hood of his car and the dead woman holding a cb radio etc if they went to another earth where life was absent why are there dead people the real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out that it doesn t make sense and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive according to the people who worked on the film the effect obviously did occur and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies again at the exact moment that the effect occurs a second time so at the end the effect does occur a second time which means the girl and api are history and the scientist as he again dies when the effect occurs moves on one more time another point that is made in the dvd commentary is that the film was made by a catholic so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind also highly irritating is that for a scientist the main character is not very smart he laments that he s the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman they find a nutty guy named api and then the three of them conclude they re the last three people on earth what are they totally daft a scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city more people than that throughout the rest of new zealand and even more people in bigger places such as america europe and asia that his first conclusion is always that they re the only ones only demonstrates his stupidity they come to believe that they all died at the same time right when the effect occurred and that that s why they remained on earth well if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny new zealand then many many other people must ve died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world	negative
we started with there goes a dump truck which actually features a different dave this first dave was in the dumptruck tractor and farm truck versions maybe a few others and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is the newer dave \( dave hood \) is in all the rest \( along with his sidekick becky in some \) and is much less goofy than the other dave i don t think the kids really care though the sillier the better and my son loves them both anyway i started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the tv i don t let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall tv to things that are at least somewhat informative educational as a result he was never one to sit and watch much tv \( made it hard for me to get things done \) but with this series he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles \( and some of the more goofy moments \) so much it really was a lifesaver at times needless to say it didn t take long for me to collect the entire series i have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations my in laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the tractor and farm truck versions with him his favorites include there goes a firetruck there goes a monster truck and there goes a spaceship but he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus i can t say enough good things about the video series as far as my son s enjoyment goes just don t look for any oscars for the acting and editing it s pretty choppy even for an amateur eye i would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle	positive

hypocrisy alert hypocrisy alert i just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start not more than twenty four hours ago i wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film i argued that fans shouldn t viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all in other words we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies now that i have gotten that out of the way i shall proceed to trash adam evil i didn t set out to heap scorn on this film when i popped it in the dvd player a few weeks ago although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and i felt my heart sinking in fact nothing screams straight to video more loudly than a film entitled adam evil well perhaps something like adam the bollweevil or even adam evil knievel might rank as likelier candidates but you get the idea adam evil does not inspire confidence that i m about to watch a slasher film on par with carpenter s halloween right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clich d slasher film hell the movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks there is seth \( kevin robson \) the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette yvonne \( erica cerra \) next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film the ever important loud guy matt \( brody harms \) along for the ride are evelyn \( barbara kottmeier \) adam himself \( sean arnfinson \) adam s girlfriend yvette \( lynsey brothers \) and a few other kids i am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the eve connotation in the three girls names and that seth is also a name pulled straight out of the old testament where matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the new testament something tells me the matthew responsible for the gospel didn t go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as matt call it a gut feeling anyway these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip drinking and romping around in the water sounds familiar doesn t it see those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision they re called red flags things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff aren t interested in helping out too a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest if you think we ll see him again before the credits roll that s one bet i won t take i should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group adam and his friend matt did something quite idiotic a few years before namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there that continues to haunt them to this day too one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful i laugh defiantly at such nonsense i won t spoil the ending for you but i will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the twist ending for a slasher film adam evil is downright puritanical with the red stuff i felt like a bizarro clara peller hollering where s the gore every time a killing went down seth for example perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless off camera fashion a couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond again a rather bloodless affair the presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things a promise unfulfilled unfortunately adam evil is one of the tamest slashers i have ever seen what did they do turn the script over to the hayes commission before shooting scenes note to aspiring filmmakers if you re going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release go over the top with the sauce at least then you ve got a shot at making a cult classic and another thing make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film sure you ll have to shell out a few more bucks but it s worth it remember unless i m laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted so bad it s good label ham handed performances can only hurt you surprisingly the dvd comes with a commentary track not that you ll want to listen to it but there it is we also get a few trailers for three other schlock films contagion hallow s end and asylum days forget about picking up a copy of adam evil it s not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf there are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention	negative
the real life base \( dr li ching yun 1677 1933 \) adds to the wonder and mystery many movies usually pale compared to the book however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic such as excellent film footage for the time even though some scenes are missing when i look at the shangri la setting some times my mind wanders and i wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book atlas shrugged by ayn rand i doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts these actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played a later remake of this movie was o k but just did not have the presence of these actors now the dvd features digitally remastered audio anamorphic video production notes restoration before and after comparison three deleted scenes photo documentary with narration by historian kendall miller many more by the way i personally enjoy watching and re watching this movie	positive
while i thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies all have their funny moments i still enjoy the first the best mainly because the jokes were original and fresh though it is still funny to see the strange things jim would get himself into levy as his father was a great choice this is worth the 20 dollars easy lots of laughs and plenty of gross out humor	positive
burt lancaster stars in this tough grim noir drenched prison flick in which a sadistic prison guard \( a young hume cronyn \) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation the film s liberal message butts up against its obligatory crime never pays ending the convicts are sympathetic but doomed from the word go a little stagey and lurid but overall tense and suspenseful the ending is a real nail biter recommended	positive
david lean s the bridge on the river kwai like jean renoir s grand illusion is an anti heroic war film set in a prisoner of war camp environment but there the point of resemblance came to an end the bridge on the river kwai is an adventure film in which the nature of world war ii is explored and if in grand illusion the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity in the bridge on the river kwai they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge blown up escape is almost impossible from the japanese camp located near the kwai river in burma the prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards the camp commander is a rigid psychopath conditions are hard to bear psychological state of the war british prisoners in constant alteration into the presumptuous situation comes colonel nicholson \( alec guinness in a fascinating performance \) a strict serene dedicated british officer deeply concerned for the welfare of his men nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn japanese colonel saito \( sessue hayakawa \) for insisting on his attachment to the geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him but his obsession has risen to near madness he agrees to help the japanese build their bridge and in his determination to find victory in defeat he ignores that the bridge which he insists must be a proper bridge will serve the japanese objectives against the british troops in addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code a third element in the story is introduced a small commando team led by major warden \( jack hawkins \) and an american sailor \( william holden \) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge the film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax a japanese train and a commando force directed to a same goal the brige of the river kwai each character in the motion picture has a valid reason for what he is doing and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane the bridge on the river kwai hits with war in a compelling logic of events the indulgence of self destruction with a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune march the bridge on the river kwai is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men	positive

my god this was the most idiotic horror film since blair witch all the character were utterly retarded they had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all duh so the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons and the ending made no sense whatsoever the ben guy is tried for their deaths sure that makes sense it s not as though they couldn t find the mine where the actual murderer was and get a crudload of dna evidence and dead bodies not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that exact place total piece of junk a wasted opportunity for all involve	negative
well i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review truthfully i didn t catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend the trailers and the dvd cover of this movie is very misleading one would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive i m a big fan of romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take off i couldn t be more wrong nothing in the movie makes sense from the start the entire movie is over the top starting with the actors everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie she looks lost confused and out of her league other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend a wacky police sgt with his asthmatic partner the bait tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest the movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere when meteors strike the earth \( and slam into people \) it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies our main characters all meet up and try to survive however aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle the viewer is left to wonder what s going on at first but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by i honestly couldn t tell you much else because it s just so terrible that i just simply couldn t take a minute more bad acting bad dialogue over the top effects and some of the worst camera work i ve ever seen this movie apparently took two years to make imagine if they only had one another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait tackle charater he shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin s life like a bad clint eastwood impression \( with big hat covering his eyes to boot \) then he walks away when he appears again he s able to do these matrix style backflips \( digging his spurs into the wall ceiling \) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands does this guy ever miss what do you think he manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia if you dig the gore this one is ok but again wayyyy over the top i had no idea that one bullet from a 45 could blow someone in half our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3 4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head i personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter someone get nasa on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don t get it the absolutely worst part of this movie without a doubt is the music it never stops there s never a scene without music for some reason and it just makes what you re watching seem absolutely cheesy it reminded me of a 1950 s serial pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing the soundtrack is truly the worst i ve ever heard with extra cheese included did they use up their budget on the effects probably i found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film if you re a fan of good monster zombie movies i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving it doesn t make sense the story is amazingly weak the plot is well there isn t one you ll wish you could have your 2 hours back i know i do	negative
this is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish action packed and very smart great cast too	positive
this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama i will not give away the plot although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it basically clooney s character mr ocean a career burgler is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino so he recruits 11 men each with a talent to add to the operation this is where the trouble begins the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters there is almost no introduction to many of them and barely even a mention of their names literally half an hour into the film the eleven are assembled and they re already robbing the casino how s that for plot development and that s basically it ladies and gentlemen go to vegas rob casino go home movie over some of the good guys are even outright repellant our would be heros enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon am i supposed to like this fat weasel the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr ocean is that the guy he s robbing the casion owner is a really bad guy supposedly he has people killed n stuff \( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 \) but we never see any real evil deeds in fact he just seems like a handsome polite very prosperous businessman he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film mr ocean on the other hand and his cohorts are career criminals but the guy they re robbing is an even greater criminal you see so that makes it ok and really if you were being robbed wouldn t you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt they re such nice guys that makes getting robbed fun just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy how thrilling this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung like a boxing match which are essentially irrelevent throughout there seems to be vital information missing \( like say a plot \) soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts this film is also horribly cut several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced and then completely forgotten about take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino s owner makes an appearence the folder he has just been handed explains pitt contains secret security codes you would think that would be something important right you would think they will need to get those codes well wrong in fact you won t hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development and that happens all the time in this movie in fact mr ocean s team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties \( and boy they started repelling down that shaft quick didn t they you didn t even know they were robbing the place yet wow these guys are good or maybe steven soderbergh is as over rated as his film \) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7 eleven this after mr ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have one would hope this film would at least end strong but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed we are left wondering whether the eleven actually got away with their caper or worse what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light hearted the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd \( as did the actors in their commentary \) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad but this film comes very close to 1 star this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product it is big on budget big on bling and low on story i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time this is as good a way to do it as any personally i would rather have a story with more substance	negative

fyodor dostoyevsky s nineteenth century novella notes from underground and the plot of this twenty first century movie carry identical messages the movie is an eloquent cinematic adaptation of the novel that gives dostoevsky s central character a new breath of life from the modern day perspective the movie attempts to survey the convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video taped self confession the psychological similarities between the character in dostoevsky s novel and the building supervisor in the movie are uncanny both characters share a state of mind that is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest the character in the movie who identifies himself as a sick man a spiteful man lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts he despises his friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his relationship with them the character in the movie voluntarily creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self demise he often finds himself confined within the conflicting walls of his consciousness he falls in love with a prostitute but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession and tries to dominate her by escalating the level of his thought process well above the habitual human awareness the central character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that dostoevsky s narrator identifies as the men of action the building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just like the narrator in dostoevsky s novel dostoevsky s novel and the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of self consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a methodical process of uniformity and conformity has a negative side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds	positive

in the days of the arcades there was a good movie that came out \( and funny enough had a great arcade game \) called krull now mind you i really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it \( when i was a whole bunch younger \) just saw the 5 bladed glaive and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie \( including those terrible scifi d d movies ugh \) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the slayers and from then on its a totally different experience with such ultimate favorites as the emerald seer the widow of the web and the cyclops and of course the shapeshifting \( a bit daft too \) wizard with some very strange habits \( i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it \) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come pros cool effects \( for the time \) good story well done plot and themes cons may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough but remember it is a tad old its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great	positive

i watched this film at the suggestions of a friend had to watch it again the very next night and have seen it several times since it s so nice to watch a film where people are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive language or elicit scenes just recently learned of some friends in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to help work throught the emotions they are having livvy a young and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the death of her mother the father of her baby leaves the scene and livvy s father insists that she will not have a child out of wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very rural area of colrado ray \( the farmer \) is shy and reserved but was brought up with high moral values and treats livvy like she is something special the rest of the movie develops the story of how ray and livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love even though that was not livvy s original intention i think the film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance i have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends i highly recommend it	positive

this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie s fans live the life nowhere close to cher s and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she s supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she s like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out	negative

the book from alex haley when i read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color and everyone should read it yes even conservatives manditory however this movie something just wasnt good to long the over all acting spike you make some great movies summer of sam is one of your best do the right thing spike has a gift for cinematography however spike lee interview on espn the interview said interviewer kanye west said that bush doesn t care about black people would you agree with that lee yes i agree with that but i ll go one step further and say that bush doesn t care about people who don t have any money \( whether they re black or white \) i guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on long island or let s say the hamptons you would have had an entirley different response from fema and his administration but you should have seen how he said it it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face the dude is bold man i ll give him that and i applaude him spike said either black white mexican or asian but what he didn t say was italians that dude has been getting flack forever for his dis n of italians in his movies they call him a racist all the time here was his chance to say something and he blew it just didn t happen to say italians no so he is a racist too and so are the africans in africa they never have liked white people either so what about that spike try going over their and applying for a job and while i am at the african americans in even baton rouge don t want the blacks from n o coming up their how come spike never said anything about that fkn whiners so many the world over give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on tv and let the world see it for the fools they are and ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling da truth	negative
i collect 1950s era sci fi and i have been replacing my vhs versions with dvds unfortunately i need to keep my vhs version for this movie because the print that image entertainment made this from was in such poor shape the vhs version by uav entertainment \( the wade williams collection \) is much better hopefully uav will come out with a dvd version soon	negative
although i m a diehard fan of this great british sitcom i can t recommend this particular dvd of it when i received it i was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording comparing it side by side on the same tv with an old vhs recording i purchased years ago clearly showed that the dvd image quality was much poorer than the vhs i believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation vhs copy of the original recording to dvd instead of going back to the original the focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image which of course didn t help i doubt we ll ever watch this dvd because the eyestrain is too great if you don t have a good copy it would be better than nothing but not by much i was also disappointed in the extras the character biographies weren t of the characters in the series but of the actors very misleading there were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate dvd the radio broadcasts were interesting though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment also there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the dvd finally while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the tv screen this can lead to screen burning on some sets	negative
this is the first and only dvds i will buy from this company this could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy i learned absolutely nothing and the women were disgusting trust me do not buy this dvd if your life depends on it	negative
this is one of my all time favorite vampire movies the cast led by tom cruise as the vampire lestat and brad pitt as the vampire louis does an excellent job of bringing to life anne rice s interview with the vampire the costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through and the cinematography is lush and sensual evoking the decadent lifestyle that lestat leads even kirsten dunst has a role here as a child vampire and her famous line i want some more has been rendered immortal in movie history the chemistry between lestat cruise louis pitt is believable and in fact they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie all in all a cinematic treat	positive

running with scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful it is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling the lead character in the movie is a 15 year old his parents divorce and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly acquired family lead is on course to become a writer \( who eventually writes the non fiction account upon which this movie is based \) but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer all the performances were serviceable save for gwyneth paltrow who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously annette benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie mrs benning performed excellently and selflessly but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie it is a sure sign that hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies the presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters furthermore the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion and are put upon or stifled by the stodgy straights the most promising characters are the psychoanalyst s wife and adopted daughter the movie has some colorful and funny scenes but these are not enough to justify a viewing	negative

if you ve read the book this movies is extremely loosely based on you will understand why the movie is so horrid it s beautiful to look at but that is all the sets and costumes are gorgeous but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a queen of france this movie completely ignores the revolution marie antoinette s arrest and murder in short the movie ignores anything that is not pretty girlish and light there is so much fluff and teen angst that it s hard to locate any fact in the film at all do we really need a 10 close up of kristen dunst wistfully lazing about her apartments after she meets a handsome man even one scene like this is bad enough but it happens over and over we see kids at play more than adults with real problems and the actors and soundtrack only reinforce this feeling there is shopping food dress up and flirting but minus a handful of very short scenes no real account of the lives of the king and queen of france there was little in the way of dialog and sadly much of what there was was murmured while dunst flounced around in her pretty dresses there is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that it s almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog for instance the dauphin and 2 brothers which we are told in the book the film is based on however in the film the brothers are combined into one very inaccurate character marie antoinette also had 2 sons not one as the movie will tell you i don t mind some changes for the sake of drama but ignoring 90 of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is factual is ridiculous the main actors are also terrible the supporting cast such as rip torn and marriane faithful is wonderful they only serve to make kirsten dunst look that much worse no one bother to act french or like the poised rulers in training that their character were the movie is so obviously a veichle for dunst that it s sickening there is just too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for her to be there remember the 10 minute scene i described where she does nothing but smile it keeps happening it gets very very old it feels more like a photo shoot for dunst than a film i usually like kirsten dunst but not in this film overall the film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been one there just isn t enough going on to warrent the film s length and it s really geared towards young girls who love pretty dresses food and shopping but have no taste for fact it s a chick flick at it s worst and it makes a mockery of the life of such an important person it s very hard to believe that this came from the same person who wrote and directed films like the virgin suicides and lost in translation	negative

i ve always been a fan of roger moore s james bond but what i ve discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were like actually good the spy who loved me is not one of them oh sure it s fun almost all of the bond flicks are fun but it s basically just a kid s movie and that s not necessarily a good thing \( 1 \) stromberg is a lame villain yes his underwater lair is well designed but it s silly not as silly as that ice palace in die another day but pretty silly \( 2 \) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls she s not an ugly woman to be sure but she was a terrible actress she sounds like she s reading poorly from a cue card in ever single scene she s in \( 3 \) jaws is a stupid character having metal teeth wouldn t actually make you capable of biting through metal the metal you were biting would resist and you d end up just tearing up your gums i don t expect realism from 007 movies but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic \( that said jaws is effectively used and richard kiel was excellent in the role \) \( 4 \) the disco score is terrible terrible \( 5 \) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of you only live twice but on the ocean rather than in space certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies embarrassing i love bond but this is not one of the highlights the dvd is good with a couple of fine documentaries but the commentary track grates because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did even if that were true it d be annoying	negative

this is a rather peculiar film for seagal and the first thing that should be pointed out to any seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief in fact they are extraordinarily brief though thankfully free of wirefu though out of reach is by no means a total failure \( it s actually pretty entertaining seagal as always is fun to watch and some of the scenes are well done \) the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes this film is a drama about a nature nut \( seagal \) who roams the forest looking for injured animals he has a pen pal in poland a young girl and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her this brings up the main problem with this film namely a lot of it simply doesn t make any sense it turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring and seagal goes through the motions to save her as per usual with seagal nowadays he obviously refused to actually finish the production and so we have the usual dubbing problem here it is even more salient than usual in this picture however for here we have not one but several different people dubbing seagal s voice none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him here the most frequently heard fill in for seagal sounds like a knock off benecio del toro with a much higher pitched voice as you can imagine the effect is very humorous as stated above the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn t make sense which was apparently realized by the director as he has in many scenes the voice fill in for seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking how obnoxious seagal s character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal which she later uses to communicate with seagal what makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for seagal the villian ineptly played by matt schultz sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for seagal to find in one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code \( apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means this is a trap \) the villain sees her doing this and instead of destroying the message \( which would make sense \) later has it delivered to seagal huh in a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling seagal where she is the villian sees her doing it comments on how clever she is but then leaves the message there are also quite of few mistakes in this film several of which are laughably obvious at the beginning and end of this film for example seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head during the rest of the film however he has short hair at the end after some bs macho dialogue about how seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing schultz slowly each character uncocks his pistol even though schultz s pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock and even though in the very next closeup seagal s pistol is still cocked after a sword fight which ends on a classic move from older chambara films notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor and that then all of a sudden there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters in the finale the above mentioned sword fight the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than seagal this brings up another frequent complaint of many seagal fans his overuse of stunt doubles it s almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn t even film his own fight scenes now have you ever noticed that in lord steven s early films when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves now what happens the camera gets as close as possible shows some shots of his face grunting shows some arms playing paddycake then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing seagal s face ever wonder why it s because surprise surprise that s not seagal doing the fighting in the gun fight which is actually a very decent action scene watch seagal as he enters the room his character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll which is probably the simplest move in aikido though it is obvious that it is not seagal doing the roll what is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film which shows seagal s character roaming the forest looking for injured animals or whatever it is clearly not seagal that we see walking through the forest was he afraid that he d trip over a branch and injure himself was he afraid he d be attacked by an injured animal in the woods i don t know what is likely the case is that seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after the fact using another actor in order to make the film work i m really not bashing seagal i m merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could very easily be fixed be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when seagal goes to the post office the postal worker calls seagal mr delacraw or some such bizarre name even though his character s name is actually billy ray lancing seagal then proceeds to mumble some french to the man and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent this scene is downright strange what is also strange is how seagal is dressed in this scene like some kind of new orleans anne rice fan vampire wannabe in a strange black fur coat i don t know at least it s good for a laugh if seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable the only truly schocking thing is that this hasn t happened yet he shows up late to shoots leaves early refuses to finish productions and yet people keep hiring the man he repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production he needs to start finishing his films in closing out of reach only has two very brief fight scenes but they are somewhat well done seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human	negative

panic room is a great thriller jodie foster s return to the big screen i d assume most people would enjoy the film itself however the real treat in the 3 disc special edition is the behind the scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture	positive

i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly \( ex one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static \) the costumes were well selected but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard \( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face \) this version follows the book well though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the drink me bottle i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film i recomend this to fans and people who aren t overly critical of films	positive

bob crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series hogan s heroes however while he was enjoying the life of a tv star he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life sexual promiscuity and deviance auto focus tells the story of bob crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess when the film opens bob \( greg kinnear in a fantastic performance \) is about to hit the big time and is a loving family man who doesn t drink or smoke he attends mass on sundays one day on the set of hogan s heroes though his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets john carpenter \( willem dafoe \) a techno guy with all the latest gadgets including video equipment which fascinates crane carp opens the door for bob to unleash his inner desires which both excite and frighten him it begins innocently enough sitting in on the drums at a strip club but eventually bob loses all self control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently swinging all the while bob refuses to admit that there s anything wrong with him if you ask him he ll tell you he s just a normal guy after hogan s heroes came to an end crane took a job with a dinner theatre show which allowed crane and carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show as crane s indiscretions get worse his personal life deteriorates as he divorces two wives \( played by rita wilson and mario bello \) auto focus has been expertly directed by paul schrader who begins the film with bright glossy colors then as crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable just as crane does kinnear gives the performance of his life showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his life	positive
torz k \( abandoned \) is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by rp d sopsits that takes us back to hungary of 1960 when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone especially children the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure ron \( tam s m sz ros \) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father \( s ndor g sp r \) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters ron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother s blindness by his friend atilla \( szabolcs csizmadia \) and the two bond emotionally and physically in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya \( krisztina somogyi \) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff there is one teacher in the orphanage school nyitrai \( l szl g lffi \) who has been reduced to his position as an imprisoned one by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy nyitrai offers ron solace and introduces his fellow traveler to the glory of the stars giving ron a map of the heavens that ron cherishes his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison like orphanage he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government hangs himself this horrid incident drives ron to organize an escape from the orphanage an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which ron feels responsible and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by p ter szatm ri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period the musical score by p ter fejcsik tam s g rg nyi ferenc toma and bal zs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings in all this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking acted with depth in every role and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books highly recommended grady harp march 06	positive
i think pauly shore is much more talented then people give him credit for it is not as easy at it seems to play the character he played in every single one of his films but the problem is that he has played the same character in all the movies he made frankly i dont think he made this movie or started his new reality show to restart his career i think he probably knows that he is a living joke i feel he is just trying to give people a laugh and i d say hes done that	positive
this is a bad movie not only because it doesn t fit chronologically in terms of feel and content it s like this film attempts to create turtles psychaitry 101 each turtle attempts to work on and or completely vanquish their weaknesses leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children and i believe that donny falls in love it s been awhile since i ve seen this film so i may have that last thing wrong more than ten years have passed since i saw this stinker and although i don t remember every minute detail the problems that i had with it are enormous first the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci fi the television series and films haven t really gleamed upon that aspect instead relying on action humor and pseudo wisdom from splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product in my opinion the separate storylines of the turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot in particular leo s and raphael s storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in the pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments they just feel heavy handed that s not to say mikey s plotline isn t just as bad but he s allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all secondly the action is just not there as it was before sure it s still pretty bloodless but the scenes are few and far between and boring the turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it s previous effects of catharsis it felt like i was watching the history channel special about the history of the turtles war in japan and they lost also the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a warner brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too i m just the kind of guy who likes \( in these kinds of movies \) the bad guys to get a death that you don t have to see or feel the impact of because you can t imagine when their end comes like falling down a bottomless pit to me bombs are out of the question in terms of death thirdly the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny an example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following or running from bad guys and they re going up stairs lots of stairs and mikey goes this is good for my calfs i was thinking what is my mom supposed to laugh at that as for the japanese men who take to american living all too well none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now it s like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk painfully unfunny and pointless equally as pointless was the use of casey jones his character in the first movie almost steals the show at times but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the japanese men in a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines in this story the writers would have casey jones completely emasculated possibly for laughs possibly for moral the former is definitely not the case the latter is underdeveloped it s like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight that s what we re thinking for a majority of the film in retrospect the japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless so he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series i admit it s a good idea but way too heavy handed the meaning is always better in small doses finally the song used in the film toward the end with the japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting it was used to great effect in the tv spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting funny action adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film oh well at least found out the name of that song	negative
bulworth is ostensibly warren beatty s brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say he tells a black church congregation to put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives if that s what you were thinking you ll love this movie otherwise bulworth is jaw droppingly bad to take such a hight position as to attack beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give bulworth way more credit than it deserves it s distinguished from movies that are simply bad through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones not content to be racism hiding in plain site bulworth s racism is disguised as its own solution drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise well intended african american youths nina \( halle berry \) articulates an informed point and it s a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart like high grammar versions of zip coon in so doing beatty reminds black americans that no matter what they accomplish we know who they really are however limited the potential of the opening premise \( bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind \) the film never approaches the kind of farley brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination the sincerity of the politician s catharsis is hidden from us both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once beatty starts rapping his lines he never stops making the actor \( as opposed to the character \) look uncomfortable for the duration that this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing the film s ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of roberto benigni s embarrassing life is beautiful from the year before both have to be seen to be believed	negative

i ll start out by saying that i prefer the jason movies i think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie the freddy movies are good horror movies but they re not really slashers like i thought they would be a nightmare on elm street a great classic horror movie by wes craven he creates good high school characters although trying to prove that they re only 15 years old is a little far fetched freddy is more horrific and scary he doesn t say much a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy s revenge they were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of freddy in this sequel many will disagree but i don t think it s a bad movie it s just very dark and horrific a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors definately a step up from part 2 it goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back nancy who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital the style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives a nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master decent entry in the series carrying over characters from 3 and introducing all new characters the story doesn t flow as easily this time around and it s a step down from part 3 but still good a nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child stephen hopkins visual style makes this the best sequel in the series freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great the story is more interesting than part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good freddy s dead the final nightmare cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an american town rachel talalay thinks the 3 d effects in the film are lame but not that story element if it weren t for the interesting backstory on freddy this wouldn t be a good movie wes craven s new nightare wes craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies nightmare encyclopedia alot of interviews that aren t edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk it s good to see that these interview aren t self serving at all and they re completely retrospective it would ve been nice to hear more from heather langenkamp or possibly johnny depp this is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans i m a huge fan of the alien series and a pretty big fan of the predator series but not as much as alien i would say that i m now a huge fan of jason and a good sized fan of freddy in comparison to alien predator i do recommend these movies but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today	positive

expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick slapstick comedy overly melodramatic subplotting and on occasion even a hint of a story all that aside \( which is how i am sure the director saw it \) the balletic intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat jet li s utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance nothing like his forgettable hollywood yawns the subtitles for this mandarin language effort are a bit difficult to read since the english is in small print below the more prominent chinese subtitles but when the action kicks into gear forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes notably notable in the three installments part i a mind blowing hook and ladder battle plus a terrific umbrella sequence part ii the climactic fight with donnie yen the speed and technique shown during the double pole fight is staggering yen s moves with his cloth staff left me gob smacked part iii this one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable the final fight scene at the lion dance competition is a colorful pageant but lacks the impact of the one on one fights in the first two films mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks all in all can t go wong with this purchase	positive

i bought this for the jeffrey dahmer and john wayne gacy documentaries like i imagine you might i m not disappointed really i don t regret buying it in any sense it s just that this dvd isn t very good at all it doesn t attempt to make any insight which isn t something i particularly care for anyway what each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers i can t imagine anyone learning something they didn t already know from them it s mostly told through pictures when it seems there s option to use video the dahmer documentary made in 1993 doesn t feature anything of interest there s no interview with his father or anything just a voice telling a story over pictures we ve all seen before with occassional clips of victims families in court the gacy one made in 96 is the same there s also a program made in 1997 on criminal profiling this look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling it s told often with video rather then photos which is good but still they re somewhat boring subjects the criminal profiler dahmer and gacy are all episodes from the a e series investigative reports if you didn t realise the last program is on charles manson it s quite different from the others on the disc made in 1997 it originally aired on television as biography charles manson journey into evil i don t with have any interest in manson but i guess it s ok it features significant interviews with manson and main female members of the family all programs run for about one hour or more i wouldn t reccomend any of them none are good at all i might even describe them as terrible considering what else is out there	negative

i only gave this movie one star because it is against amazon s rules to give it no stars after hearing that this was a christian movie i could not wait to watch it however this movie has nothing in common with christianity quite the contrary this is the most anti christian movie that i have ever seen it promotes murder and other unsurpassable evil the movie started out horribly and just continued to get worse for instance the beginning of the movie was shockingly pornographic in a supposedly christian movie i did not expect to be bombarded with this after seeing this i did not expect that the movie could possibly get worse however i was greatly mistaken later in the movie the main character who was remarkably unsympathetic met several of her christian co workers who were talking about something they called the pearl dream intrigued the main character asked them what this dream was of course they were unable to answer because it is complete nonsense none the less the main character continues to review what her co workers have told her about christianity over the years as the movie plods along generally confusing and boring the viewer she comes to the decision to give up her sinful lifestyle and turn to god when this event transpired i assumed wrongly that from this point forward the film would redeem its beginning and maybe even say something good about christianity this however is where the movie went form being merely bad to astoundingly sacrilegious then the main character and her young daughter set out for the desert due to a vague dream they believed that this was god s will and that he would appear in the desert and take them to heaven in other words rapture them how they came to this assumption i was never quite sure the movie often made ludicrous statements which never made the slightest amount of sense i became extremely weary trying to deduce what was happening nothing that took place in this movie was remotely biblical nor was it well explained as time passed our characters continued to sit in the desert boring the viewer to tears they begin to suspect that god was not coming to gather them to heaven and they started to despair this is where the movie became intolerably anti christian the mother took her daughter up to a mountain and asked her to kneel she then forced her daughter to pray after the prayer was concluded she took a gun from her dress and shot her crying daughter supposedly to send her to heaven she believes that she is doing god s will obviously she was such an idiot that she failed to read that the bible that strictly forbids murder afterwards she is sent to prison where we hope to see her suffer for her cruel viscous and insurmountably stupid act as she is sitting in her cell blaming god for the murder of her daughter that she willingly committed \( if she had half a brain cell she would have realized that she was doing satan s will not god s \) she hears trumpets and the cell walls start to fall in a few scenes pass in which the ghost of her daughter returns and tries to redeem her faith she however refuses then she is taken to a dark room that the viewer is supposed to believe is some supernatural place where judgment takes place and asks if she loves god she replies no because she blames him for her insanity the film concludes with her standing stupidly in a dark room that failed to represent eternity most of the aspects included in the film were never explained such as the significance of the pearl dream nor was it explained why they believed that they needed to wait in the desert how did they contrive this ridiculous idea from a vague ambiguous and utterly vapid dream anyway none of these questions were ever answered this caused the film to feel incomplete the stories between scenes shifted so drastically that i suspected i had missed several important scenes after checking my dvd i realized that i had not accidentally skipped crucial scenes because their were none this film was deliberately ambiguous and vapid also the special effects cinematography and acting were about as good as a preschool play none of the actors put any emotion into their roles they recited their lines like drugged zombies i suppose even they realized it was complete rubbish and decided not to put much effort into it to state the obvious this film is a disgrace obviously it is not biblically based it does not represent christian philosophy which is to love others not to wander around aimlessly in the desert acting like a fool nor do christians promote murder as this film implied this movie has as much religious value as night of the blind nazi zombies i am ashamed to see that such a complete travesty is labeled a christian film this film is extremely anti christian its main objective is to give the world the false impression that fundamentalist christians are brainwashed and are incapable of sane thoughts this is not true and yes i can prove it all the proof that you need is contained in the bible if you stop hardening your heart and truly listen with an open mind then you cannot help but to see jesus loving message for the world he does not desire to bring misery to the world but happiness and love the reason that there is misery in the world is because people like those who made this film disobey god if we followed his loving rules then we would not suffer i do not write this rather long review out of hatred as i am sure many will accuse me of i write this to warn people what this movie is really about it is not a true christian movie like the left behind s and the passion of the christ and yes i am aware that i will be bombarded by a slough of negative votes however i do not even faintly care my beliefs as a fundamentalist christian and my love of god is more important to me than a number on a page also i was shocked to read the other reviews on this forum especially the one from the wiccan woman who said that she wished to see christians thrown to the lions as they were in the time of the romans i have seen a lot of hatred in my life but her review was by far the worst i have ever see christians love the world and those in it we do not tell non christians about christ to imply that we are holier than thou because we are not all are equal under god s eyes we are all sinners and the only way to attain redemption is to accept god s undeserved grace we tell other people about god s undeserved love because we want to save them and see them living in eternal joy in heaven we do not rejoice to see people unsaved we tell them about their condition because we want to see them saved in other words we tell people because we love them also for those of you who accuse christians of having a hatred of the world why do you spew hatred in everything you say toward christians aren t you displaying the hatred that you claim you abhor in conclusion this is the worst movie ever made it is anti christian immensely sacrilegious poorly acted poorly written vapid mind numbingly dull disjointed tortuously long etc in short this film is an abomination it is massively offensive to christians and is a massive misrepresentation of christian values also the acting is abysmal and the story line hopelessly confusing if you wish to watch a film that accurately portrays christian values then i recommend watch the passion of the christ or the left behind movies i hope that this review will help you it was written with love and concern i shall keep you in my prayers have a wonderful new year in christ ravenova also recommended the left behind and the ravenloft book series	negative

my sister and i loved this show growing up \( the huxtables reminded us of our extended family \) the episode where stevie wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes \( in my opinion \) i do question why in amazon s list of actors at the top of the page \( for the season 2 set \) joseph c philips is the only one listed although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later regardless this is a great collection and a must for cosby fans	positive

i saw this crapfest in the theater and i should have known what i was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window but at the entrance of the theater as well i only gave it one star because there wasn t a no star rating even though it deserves a negative rating as a horror fan i was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started it seemed to have alot of promise but once we met baby and her family the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate the movie was disgusting repulsive and made no clear sense at least with michael or freddie you knew what the h ll was going on and i thought that blood sucking freaks and blood sucking vampires from pittsburgh sucked but corpses not only sucked it blew as a friend told me later what in the h ll did you expect from rob zombie what did i expect indeed no wonder most production firms refused to touch this film	negative
i loved this dvd set grew up watching it and remember running home after school to catch each days episodes watching this set transported me back to another time when things were peaceful and less frazzeled stayed up till 2 am watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again like many young girls back then i was in love with tim considine so nice to see he and david back talking about it i hope disney co will put out the next 2 series of this great show on dvd soon	positive
for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don t buy this dvd the death part of the dvd part 1 is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part 2 is new stuff very good but if you buy the end of evangelion you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so don t buy death rebirth buy the end of evangelion instead	negative

i agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter however the couple of minutes where rory block sings if i had possession over judgement day are worth the entire price of this dvd don t buy the tape cos you ll have to sit through so much stuff you won t make it but on the dvd you can go straight to rory block and never watch the rest	negative

this is one of the worst edited documentary i have ever seen you can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes slow motion and unnecessary digital fx i have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min mtv music clip or a tv add but on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick if fine edited all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours each episode has a more than 2 min introduction during the episodes you see some shots more than ten times by the way i am a very long time aviation enthousiast	negative
i just watched mommie dearest for the first time tonight as most critics and fans of mommie dearest acknowledge the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse with such an over dramatic \( but entirely true to life \) performance by faye dunaway it was both hilarious and depressing i m 30 and didn t know much about joan crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being classic camp seems to me crawford was probably bi polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder i think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to she knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do whether it was having a successful marriage a happy family or even giving to charity her life was a running commercial directed by hollywood not unlike the tabloid driven image obsessed hollywood we have today despite the often times hilarious image of her and her sibling s victimization on film christina s abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life christina crawford was completely justified turning her mother s image on its head with her book and movie yes the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering after all what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh mocking the unexplained unjustified pain you experienced in the past renders it powerless to harm your future this is the legacy of mommie dearest whatever joan crawford really was	positive

a 130 minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality this swedish import doesn t so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place wouldn t know what to do with it if you did have it and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts the plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as well worn which seems to be a euphemism for shop worn clich or stupefyingly unoriginal here it is \( spoilers follow \) daniel a big shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood takes over and revives the local church choir heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness finds love finds his inner child and finally at the moment of his and his choir s greatest triumph croaks a great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program but kay pollack isn t up to it instead in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness he celebrates embraces wallows in the schmaltz throws it at you until it s dripping off you like oobleck and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film indeed there s something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent albeit of the ed wood variety and while watching it i almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind as in the kingsley amis story about the poet who at the end of a long and successful career publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs \( speaking of whom as it is in heaven was nominated for best foreign film at the oscars in 2005 after being strewn with similar honors in sweden where it was reportedly seen by some two million viewers we re used to this kind of idiocy from the academy but what s going on in the country of strindberg and bergman has someone been putting something in the k ttbullar \) a standard feature of movies like this \( and books like this if it comes to that cf ayn rand \) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant aiiih is no exception the parade of didactic marionettes includes daniel s love interest a ditzy twenty year old blonde who represents the life force the humorless sexually repressed hypocritical preacher who represents the church which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity especially in modern scandinavia the wife beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates and then finally locks up and forgives who represents violence and what to do about it the retarded kid whom daniel insists on letting into the choir chiefly so that he can become the film s symbol of the virtues of inclusiveness and the deep human wisdom of special people \( incidentally it s about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people in movie after movie as symbols of purity goodness wisdom beyond the ken of those cursed with normal intelligence or whatever is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them it just seems nicer can t we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being the only one i can recall seeing is best boy a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago apart from that they ve been reduced to targets of witless ridicule as in there s something about mary or turned into plaster saints as here \) so to sum up save your money and your time which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of the o c run don t walk from your local art theater if this is the main attraction and don t forget the moral of the story rather comforting to me as an expatriate american living in a europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis vis the usa kitsch is global	negative

how good is angelina jolie in this film it is a testament to this young actor s presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is there is not a frame in this film that doesn t feel her infection winona rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused \( or is it enlightened \) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche the interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless one look into angelina jolie s eyes and you will see the warm jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they ve tempted your own tired efforts even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl s decent into psychological insecurity it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced james mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil no melodrama no over the top sentimentality just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives if you ve ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life this film is certain to trigger old fears but it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be this film deserves that second look as well as its painful salvation a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend it is a heavy drama so be forewarned and a very moving drama at that	positive
a style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women this movie is for you elliot s love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy contrived and lame narrative clealry it s about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting it s alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy if anything this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy sadly it s been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are camp and therefore funny indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp \( go read susan sontag boys \) and how low gay culture as plummeted there are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia and a secondary racist commentary about thai women entrapping aussie men trashy and not in a good way a must have for no brainer gay men	negative
i think if charles bukowski dylan thomas and fellini collaborated on a piece of writing it s possible they would have come up with this screenplay this movie is exciting because it s soooo different from anything i ve ever seen deliciously non linear the substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that s the destiny of artist movies i loved hearing the dialog and kristofferson s acting is the best i ve ever seen by him anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people \( like other reviewers here \) but if you ask me that only validates the work if ever i go to new york city the hotel chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit my favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator who after claiming to have had a conversation with dylan thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the chelsea because people will listen to them there the dvd extras contain a couple of quirky interviews one with director ethan hawke and the other with robert sean leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film	positive

victor hugo s enormous output is unique in french literature he was described as the most powerful mind of the romantic movement and his novel published in 1862 continued to be widely read the plot that of a detective is as well the epic of the people of paris its author claimed it as a religious work and indeed by means of its characters sometimes a little larger than life yet always vital and engaging and by its re creation of the swarming parisian underworld the main theme of man s ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life hugo relives his youth in this vast novel the culmination of 14 years work he and valjean share their most outstanding characteristic their charitable heart the story contains glimpses of hugo s disgust towards the treatment of the lower class french citizens by the government valjean an ex convict recently released from prison but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child and towards the general injustice of the law enforcement system valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class the symbol of france s greed that hugo despises is thenardier the man that fantine entrusts cosette to who betrays the trust by essentially making cosette his personal slave the strongest emotions of les mis rables are love and hate javert and valjean are both extremes with a conscience incredibly strict liam neeson is cast as the gentle valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation he changes his ways to become years later the much loved mayor of vigau and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent giving manual and financial help to the weak sick and poor after nine years valjean was horrified to discover that javert a former guard of the quarries of toulon where he served almost 20 years has arrived to be the head of vigau s police force valjean s desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire \( indirectly \) one of his workers fantine turned prostitute he assumes responsibility for raising her daughter cosette he becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness geoffrey rush plays the icy chief inspector javert the man who tries to live his life without breaking a single rule when he is given the job of spying in the barricades and valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him things begin to fall apart for him the action of mercy of jean valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence he is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions he sees too late the truth valjean s legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud he is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in paris to investigate the mayor the man he believes is a convict when he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying monsieur le maire as the convict jean valjean he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed you must punish me he says or my life will have been meaningless \( a key line in the film \) uma thurman approaches the self indulgent character of fantine with admirable restraint giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film she gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character s frustration and pain exquisitely fantine s misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child being in a wild state enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery she is arrested after being humiliated by several would be customers but valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding javert s authority when valjean helps her she begins to rediscover hope her joy at the thought of having cosette with her is great but the shock of valjean s arrest and the discover that cosette is not there are too much for the poor creature claire danes plays the teenage cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful she disobeys her father s rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing marius a charismatic young parisian revolutionary with whom she fell in love cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the thenardier s inn horribly mistreated and constantly terrified she grew up in a convent innocent pure and a bit na ve peter vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered valjean around bille august tries to capture the essence of hugo s morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance keeping the eternal three elements the bishop handing over the candlesticks fantine s collapse marius crying out to the barricades history doesn t change as voltaire once remarked but what we need from it does valjean s story is not unique it s universal in other world it s contemporary there are certainly enough les mis rables to go all around the world	positive
this is a well written thoughtful film charlie hunnam \( pete \) really stands out to me he s perfectly cast compelling to watch and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his mates it was especially interesting to watch his relationship with elijah wood s character evolve the whole concept of an american being immersed in the british football scene is a unique one and i think it was pulled off really well the lessons that elijah wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must see	positive

the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical though different characters and locations are used the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this remake is quite frankly terrible bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman which was fairly amusing but hardly essential and a tacked on conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous i won t explain it theres no point watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though even die hards admit its awful i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst \( yes even worse than this \)	negative

that s all i could think of when my family and i sat down to watch this movie together we had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in santa fe the story itself is so powerful and moving built in the 1870s the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit the sisters prayed a novena to st joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived built the miraculous staircase and then disappeared without being paid the staircase is a double helix with no visible support it s 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near santa fee this movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards indians and also likes to curse \( how this has anything to do with the actual story i still have no idea \) at one point when a nun is shocked to hear mother curse mother surperior responds oh margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us when the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by god builds the staircase with wood that doesn t work is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better in the end the staircase is built and this mother superior \( who is on death s door \) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very weird uncomfortable scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies wow inspiring the best thing i could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a hollywood flop this was obviously written directed and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn t a miracle because hey miracles just don t happen the acting was pretty good but the story was junk unfortunately i bought this movie if you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family rent or buy mother theresa with olivia hussey hands down the best saints movie every filmed half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud wow she really cares about everybody inspirational movie compared to this disappointment	negative
this film is one big joke you have all the basics elements of romance \( love at first sight great passion etc \) and gangster flicks \( brutality dagerous machinations the mysterious don etc \) but it is all done with the crudest humor it s the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately get or you don t that is a matter of taste and expectations i enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s when nicolson and turner were in their primes the acting is very good if a bit obviously tongue in cheek recommended	positive

the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980 s it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series it was a travesty to see optimus prime \( the greatest of the transformers \) fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor \( rodimus prime \) who proved incapable of leadership galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie they were forgettable it amuses me that fans are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did as a fan i was insulted perhaps these other fans have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage	negative

four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction loaded with drugs with paul mccartney in charge what do you get magical mystery tour with no plot great music this plays as a too long music video without purpose ok if you re a beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967 but if you weren t a beatles fan then there is no reason for this at least a hard days night with richard lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers but this too many drugs and too much ego and no direction that s all	negative

i idiotilcy got this dvd because of colin firth and as you can see it sucks btw this is not prasadjonnalagadda but rather his daughter he just comes to buy crap but never reads the reviwes anyways i had better time watching a syndicated simpsons episode than watching this bomb at first i thought that this movie might ve had some potential because of the suberb stars colin firth and minnie driver \( good will hunting won an oscar for it \) i did not yet know heather grahm but after this movie i hate her now i will admit she was alright up until she got drunk in the car that was annying beyond reason other than that the film s set up is absolutly horrible starting off with colin coming to a town just because it s called hope and falling in love with someone only after a couple of days and there is also the horrible music that doesn t fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene pepole i originnaly gave this a 2 star for colin and minnie but heather is responsible for everything else	negative
this movie was just plain bad it doesn t just stink it reeks if i was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment i can t believe that the other reviews were so complimentary it s the reason why i purchased the movie and i regret my decision i should have read the reviews more closely some of the reviewers hadn t acutally seen the film while i am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film everything about this movie is sup par the script was horrible the sets amateurish the dialogue stilted \( and not in the funny style reminiscent of the tv series which i loved \) there are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink first the only footage they used was from the batman movie not the tv series i have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the tv series realized that this movie was so bad they didn t want to associate themselves with it they didn t use the original batmobile but a cheap rip off i could continue by why make you suffer the chemistry between adam west and burt ward is non existent and the chemistry between the actors playing adam west and burt ward in the flashback scenes is substandard at best this movie is beyond dreadful there are cameos from a few villains from the original tv show but they re dreadful too not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad i wish i could say i laughed i wish i could say that i at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all i can say is that i watched this movie in dead silence do not waste your money or your time on this movi	negative
i ve been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo i m just happy i waited untill it came on tv i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it the romance was slim to none i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role well i won t say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it anyway i would much rather watch beautiful thing get real all over the guy the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love	negative
saw the trailer online and knew i d love it on dvd i was right laughed my ass off 8 times after watching it so many times of the 8 times i watched it that is it is sad tucker couldn t be in this one and last friday movie but it s still great the new cast members add more humor just as much the ones in the second and first friday movies the plot is deeper more twisted more funny more senseless especially with day day i laughed so hard the extras are worth it cube is great at making films so no one slam him he is an amazing film maker considering he used to star in movies when he can star in one and create it that s more then genious that s innovative he does good at starring and making movies give him props people and you can t always please everyone with what you make remember that i loved this one and will get the other 2 movies on dvd when i can the scenes are just hilarious and priceless like the other friday movies so glad i bought this on dvd give it a chance people	positive

this was one of the worst group performances i have ever seen unbelievable that disney has financed this hack act and the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of disney save your money for a better movie	negative
if this movie was ever going to have a chance it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just can t be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just wasn t time enough i guess to develop the characters or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating and we are left with painful stereotypes and in the case of roland michell a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you ve read the book skip the movie but if you saw the movie you should do yourself a favor and get the book	negative
you want the greatest zombie film ever made in the most deluxe version dvd possible today buy this set today as it includes 3 versions of the film including argento s take on the film known as zombi dawn of the dead dawn of the dead has that 79 feel with wide camera shots that allow the characters to breathe unlike so many modern horror flicks that smother the stars with endless closeups the zombie gore is to be noted as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some parts throughout but no real feasting occurs till the end for the ultimate payoff yes the zombies are pasty and fresh since the outbreak has just began which joins a team of four who struggle to survive in a mall while the world is quickly overtaken in this dawn of the dead easily the strongest romero entry and amongst all zombie films	positive
colorado s san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview of durango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids while cute outsmart all the stupid adults the first 30 minutes showed some nice locations in and around durango including the steam train \( that s why i purchased a used copy \) but then it goes into time travel to save ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children don t bother unless you love durango as much as i do	negative
the movie is a about a guy who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that that s pretty much the whole story well the idea is quite powerful but not new the characters are done in the comics style and very primitive the jokes are quite boring actually what is really amazing that it could ve been ok to watch as a family movie but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids too boring for adults not appropriate for kids too much moral for young crowd i can t really think who might like it	negative
dirty deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself this is idiotic but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll it s silly it s a teenager movie it s been done a million times before in hollywood \( most of the time poorly \) dirty deeds is one of the sub par high schoolers making mischief attempts where if you re perusing cable late one night and can t find anything else on your 500 channels is maybe worth a stop if you re determined to watch tv instead of just going to bed but who knows you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers just look what 1980 s teeneager movie hollywood knights launched for the likes of michelle pfeiffer tony danza robert wuhl and fran drescher everybody s got to start somewhere right	negative
nowadays hollywood just wouldn t have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism unless it was an easy target that doesn t spit back \( aka america and it s 1st amendment \) this film harkens back to the day when people wished our country s foreign policy was a bit more leathery well ya got it now at the very least a film like this would piss off the surrender monkeys in the jackass party not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism but for the villification and slaughter of stalinistic castro like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with makes one wonder if the lefty glenn close now hates herself for acting in such a film what would they say to a film like this unfortunately there s plenty of room for criticism in this movie aside from the political implications therein some \( arguably if not all \) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey \( hence the 4 stars instead of the five \) i think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything it would have to be the 90 s style cgi especially the plane crash at best one might go so far as to say it was cute and what can a guy like me say to that even as i write this review scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al qaida in iraq al zarqawi caught himself a couple of 500 lb bombs with the use of his house for those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized \( not a far stretch from fear mongering right \) in the fight against terrorism this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate america what s worse they can t seem to ban a film exalting american nationalism such as air force one from those who wish to see it \( oh no \) and just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about the passion sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every american and not just the idealistic intellectual few doesn t it	positive
i enjoy this genre of film but found this one dull it carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief but fall short of both aims i actually groaned in response to the predictability and shuttered at the stereotypes which were mentioned in another review at best stereotypes of ignorant aggressively dangerous and perpetually struggling african and hispanic american students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable blue eyed blonde haired european american belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive at worst these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring this movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both further it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial societal and economic issues which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for	negative
having drooled over the goodtimes dvd for years now i did a flip and a half when i saw universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story i refrained from doing two flips when i remembered it was universal and then saw no mention of special features what look at the potential for bonuses there was an alternate ending there were deleted scenes how about a featurette argh i just wept and wept and then months later the release date comes i tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically i hit menu and get the nagging old operation prohibited by disc usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old fbi warnings there s not even a menu no scene selection geez do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus i d like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of sarandon and spader note how spader s hair changes near the end because of reshoots but i m just too raving mad at universal right now	positive
i have worked out to denise austin for several years because i think she gives a good workout but i cannot stand her way too perky personality i was very disappointed in this dance workout the setting is fun and colorful and the music is great but as far as a workout this dvd really stinks i found some of the steps somewhat confusing \( but i am not very coordinated \) this workout was more of an indoor walk style workout \( like walk away the pounds w leslie sansone etc \) if you are looking for a fun way to get up and move this may be for you but this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout	negative
we caught this movie on pbs when it first came on and my daughter was hooked it s a change from the regular arthur animation this one is computer animated she was very intrigued by that fact and then the story is about a puppy well there you go the story is well written a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after pal there are even a few catchy tunes as well highly recommend this to every arthur fan out there	positive
i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham \( t v s alien nation \) is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it can t save this one from being just a let down skip it	negative
very entertaining movie i enjoyed everything about this movie the acting the humor the singing and storyline also being from san diego originally it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark the hotel del coronado being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed no the hotel wasn t the seminole ritz in florida	positive
was surprised by the price compared to other movies but it was worth it	positive
once again koch for reasons that i cannot possibly fathom assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren t being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes i know i m feeling large amounts of gratitude it s gratitude when you want to disembowel someone right at least the copy i bought was used so koch didn t make a dime off of me anyway this is another koch release that you should definitely avoid	negative
gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie \( of course it was just a product of its time the mid 60s it s not a film trying to recapture the era it is the era \) still the storyline is slim and the going slow interesting scenes appear here and there the parts are definitely better than the whole there s an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should actually thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was it s subtle i ll grant you that and a nice character study and yet we were counting the minutes left in the film by the end \( only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives \) so that s not a good sign	negative
thank heaven for larry david and curb your enthusiam or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and provocative to watch that wasn t political except south park reno 911 which are really in a different league altogether	positive
first of all this is not the worst movie ever made nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars the worst movie ever made was autumn in new york but that is a different review no this not a great movie but it is very interesting and for once thank god it doesn t end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie bleak more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing for molly ringwald she didn t do anything of note again until the stand six years later and for andrew mccarthy well it could be argued that he still hasn t starred in anything of note again \( although he probably made some money from weekend at bernies i ii \) anyway probably better to rent than buy i am only buying it to complete my 80 s collection	negative
this movie is a reallllllllllllly scary movie the only part i didn t like was that pervert mikks in the beginning be warned of grossness that is all i need to say	positive

i encourage anyone who enjoys superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun filled nostalgia to purchase the entire series of the adventures of superman \( played by george reeves \) the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed dvd s \( i got mine all at once in a 3 pack collection saving a little \) this is your chance to view the entire superman tv series from the first episode to the last \( prematurely ending with the death of george reeves \)	positive
as has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as you ve got mail with tom hanks and meg trout pout ryan of the several versions in the good old summertime is my least favorite the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma which doesn t quite cut it here the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie there are no real sparks van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts pleasant but stale and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow judy in particular is disappointing she looks like she has no neck i don t know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it s head into it s shell all hunched up and everything i couldn t figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player and van wasn t great either i ve always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he doesn t do anything to dispel that image here if you re a fan of the stars or the early 1900 s then you might like this movie but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection	negative

i m a huge don cheadle fan but this film is unworthy of him people who claim that it s a story about racism either don t understand the film or don t understand racism basically here s the plot the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store rather than summon help for the others all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register he is caught and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film because pfeiffer s family insists on proving that he s no animal and can take his punishment in this case death with his head held high yeah right guess what he is an animal and if the story had involved all black or all white characters racism wouldn t be an issue a more compelling question if pfeiffer s family was so concerned with his dignity why didn t they teach him moral values in the first place	negative
i think i understand what camp is the damned is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of nazi germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time i guess gay folks everywhere can blame luchino visconti the great director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in nazi ss garb mel brooks realized in his film the producers that nazi s are damn funny but not even brook s vision could foresee the downfall of the essenbeck family as the currents of early nazi bloodshed swirls about the uniforms are art deco at its worst the young blonde aryan cross dressers are a bathhouse dream until they re lined up against the wall rome may have had caligula but the reich had blonde pedophiles what a thrill to see helmut berger swishing about in marlene dietrich bodice and stockings i watched the whole thing and i m going to end this review to take a shower	negative

i ve been a longtime fan of seagal s movies but i was greatly disappointed by this film first there were clearly sections where steven seagal s voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him \( clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming \) it was surprising that they could not take the time to get seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections there were also very few action sequences that demonstrated seagal s skills with martial arts in many ways this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film little action but lots of bloody corpses lying about i enjoyed black dawn far more and feel it was a much better made film	negative
i heard so much about masaki kobayashi s harakiri so i bought it at amazon and watched it wow this movie is awesome now i don t know who is my 1 favorite director akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu in addition to these assets the camera is wonderful i pick this movie as one of my movies of my life tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie i like him more after seeing harakiri	positive

joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that s romantic enough for girls funny enough for guys with effective visual symbolism and appropriate for the whole family maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life or something like that but at any rate it s pleasant to watch at times profound at other times funny the beginning 3rd is about joe \( tom hanks \) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy really crummy job primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical \( oppressive \) supervisor \( dan hedaya \) \( i ve been there myself when i worked at pines mfg h h tooling and again at toro where everyone was on dope \) joe learns from his doctor \( robert stack of the untouchables \) that he has a brain cloud and only a few months to live the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that s ever happened to him he takes a former co worker \( meg ryan \) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time the next day billionaire lloyd bridges \( airplane \) enters joe s life with a bizarre proposition since he s dying anyway why not literally jump into a volcano for the billionaire s own financial motive and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis \( the client \) and the billionaire s two daughters both played by meg ryan \( sleepless in seattle \) which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie making it even more pleasant to watch	positive
the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i ve seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it s almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film s ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote just okay nothing to write home about	negative

i covered a similar theme in my international relations ma whilst any programme made for tv has to be reasonable breif on the subject i found this to be a very well argued and produced programme i recomend it not so much as some dark conspiracy but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country we should question to make sure that what happens in our name is always in our interest	positive
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you don t want to be disappointed and feel like you ve been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one	negative
this is kl s reveiw this was a very good movie but the plot was a little on the strange side mitchel musso did a great job well we all know he always does a great job okay i ll stop drooling over him and get back to the movie this movie is about a cranky old man that dosn t like people to set one foot on his lawn and a teenage boy that lives across the street that documents every toy the old man takes because it touched his lawn what time it was when it accured and takes pictures but then when a tragic incident happens to the old man and every one asumes him dead well at least the boys do the teenager dj and his friend chouder discover that the house is even stranger than the old man and that the house seems to be possessed by the old man well thats what the boys think then when a arogant girl named jenny selling holloween candy goes up to the house dj and chouder come to her rescue and she ends up helping them find out more about the house their plan is to put out the fire or the heart of the house but when thay finally get inside of the house they discover a very strange thing which i m not going to say because your going to have to just watch it for your self but before they get to the heart they get up chucked lol and then a horrable thing comes to their minds its holloween and every kid that goes to that house is going to get eaten but i m geting too close to the ending or am i well if you haven t seen it you wouldn t know so you ll just have to watch it because i m not giving any more of the movie away hope you like it and by the way mitchel musso s mine	positive
this movie was the first dvd i ever bought it is truly a gem i like the infinifilm bonus features \( it may not have been called infinifilm at this time \) brett ratner is truly a comedic genius and really gives the customer great quality dvd s the movie is funny and interesting enough i enjoyed the scenes in several different locales i enjoyed the physical interactions between jackie and chris tucker i think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated jackie chan is a genius at physical comedy i highly recommend this dvd two thumbs up mc white said check it out	positive
i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it s really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me god made music and god made animals they re awesome	negative
take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same really is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids they deserve better the key point of this movie is that lying is bad good point a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks also good unfortunately the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible \( even kids will have a hard time believing a man can t tell he s been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror \) and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion the entire thing falls flat making films for children is a fine thing they shouldn t be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children however quite honestly i d rather have a kid watch something like good will hunting before this don t waste your children s time with this film read them a book a good book instead	negative
it s just like the hit tv show in fact they probably got the idea for the tv show from this movie actually i thought it was more of a comedy than anything i saw it on the we network it s worth the price if you feel like buying it	positive
the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson s third major motion picture the movie revolves around a rich but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum \( gene hackman \) royal and his wife etheline \( angelica huston \) had three children chas \( ben stiller \) margot \( gwyneth paltrow \) and richie \( luke wilson \) in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america s premier families margot was a famous playwright richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u s nationals and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten betrayal failure and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died what s worse is that royal s children and wife blame him for all their failures royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend pagoda \( kumar pallana \) royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family s eyes i m a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films the royal tenenbaums is anderson s most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture however it is my least favorite of his movies like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family a theme that i enjoy yet the film just didn t resonate with me as much as anderson s other pictures i really don t know why that is that s not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it s not in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting brilliant set designs etc i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic drama about a sea voyaging documentarian instead	positive
i saw this movie on t v for the first time a few days ago and now i m buying the dvd i m not a big fan of action movies but i do watch them now and again i ve read quite a few negative reviews about this film and i think they are undeserved when i saw it i thought it was good not diehard good but it held its own i really enjoyed it i really liked the idea that they included a female member of swat one never sees a woman swat member it looks like this is one of those movies you either love like or hate one has to make up one s own mind	positive
i love the history channel have infinite respect for the avg love john wayne films and lived two years in the part of china where flying tigers is set so you d think i might adore this film i had hoped so but unfortunately republic pictures made this opus on the cheap john wayne plays a fictional commander of the american volunteer group somewhere between claire chennault and pappy boygnton he does his best to carry the film and does ok but he can t carry it alone bad effects cheap stock footage flimsy sets and bad script all plague tigers republic made little effort to hide the california filming location and even used the wrong planes there is little mention of the oss avg connection and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the avg even if it were accurate the heroes of the avg deserve better than tigers this film isn t a tribute to them it s a sloppy propaganda film that does them little service	negative
i just can t say enough good things about the brainy baby series of videos and toys i have allowed my baby to watch one brainy baby video per day since he was about 6 months old he loves them and i love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen \) as soon as the brainy baby theme music comes on he starts to smile he is captivated i like them much more than the baby einstein videos and the toys he loves them hello brainy baby they are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box i have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time we love brainy baby at our house	positive
this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie and slapping yahushua jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand the so called scholarly comments for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate even the lowliest of bible scholars if honest will realize this it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible while trying to tear it down at the same time the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rd dvd i gave the movie to a relative without that add on	negative
this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting \( especially the girls playing christy and ariel \) is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us \( yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada \) anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed	negative
amazon should send all of these 25th anniversary dvd s back to uni the faulty product locks up after about 1 1 2 hours on both my panasonic and sony dvd decks i see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product simply put don t buy this lousy universal product	negative

i owned the vhs version of the wild wild world but decided to get the dvd this winter well that was a great purchase i understand people that could see the documentary of jayne in europe as pretty cheaply made but it is still jayne and if you love her \( as i do \) any film she was in \( except the girl can t help it and will success spoil rock hunter \) was done on the cheap with ridiculously small budgets the wild wild world gives you the chance to see a candid jayne in all kinds of very campy situations and the best scenes are when jayne pretends to be offended by the goings on it shows a jayne mansfield who was indeed a true original rather eccentric person in the anal retentive american fifties i can t help comparing her to what anna nicole smith has done with her career as a media sensation but jayne was doing basically the same fifty years ago which was understandbly much more shocking for the common folks when jayne talks about her film roles you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself i don t understand how she can be compared to marilyn monroe mm was looking for privacy more serious roles spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to when jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about jayne was not too picky about her roles and the kind of attention she was getting and it was her undoing sad but she needed the money to keep up that image all those children dogs and husbands now about the labyrinth of sex it is hysterical and a great choice to make the dvd a double feature just like the good old days of the drive ins when you get over the awful dubbing the documentary is rather well made naive to today s standards of course but well intentionned some viewers will just see crass exploitation but if you are into campy kitsch movies and you see ed wood jr as a genius well you will love it the movie trailers are very funny as well and make you wish you could find them so my conclusion is that dvd is an excellent purchase a must have for any serious jayne mansfield fan	positive
i give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer this movie is not bram stoker s dracula but a rip off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story if it was named something else or even kept the name dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name i d give it 5 stars if you want to see the real dracula story first read the actual book by bram stoker then watch the silent film nosferatu nosferatu is the only dracula movie that gets the story right dracula is a monster he s not a star crossed lover at all and wasn t intended to be people wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn t one it s a horror tale not a vieled porn book and certainly not a love story if anything the ones that fail to understand dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him	negative
this went up from one in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii but otherwise its just a mess the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes who also gave us such film masterpieces as casino royale and chitty chitty bang bang richard harris is his usually unrestrained self and thats not a compliment now i wont even go into the politics which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas s paean to charles ii in twenty years after but nowhere near as entertaining	negative

about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who s not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick incestuous and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood don t watch this	negative
this is one of the best animes i ve ever seen what does it for me is the same people that drew cowboy bebop has now drawn wolf s rain i love the music played in the series that s why they made a cd came along with also a stuff amimal wolf i wish their was a second season cause i began to love the show	positive
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when mr arnold s arm drops on ellie s shoulder as she s trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i ve memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i ve come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he s as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton s novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way \( in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random unpredictable events result from the normal equation setup because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive in a single sex environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict long term behavior of his animals \) love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the mr dna segment in a high school biology class i ve always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated \( though i found mr hammond s live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour \) the kids were kind of annoying i didn t notice this until i was a little older but lex \( i prefer to be called a hacker \) uses silicon graphics 3d file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the mid 90s tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice	positive
i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i can t believe how disappointed i am for this i was expecting fireworks instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head not only that but it maybe the most over the top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like what is the meaning then there s the film s signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera again i said to myself what s the point and then there s the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory s character getting shot in the head in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because oswald realized that he was raymond shaw if he s right that raises the question did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of the manchurian candidate and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 s what it is and why people today \( including me \) are still obessed with that decade in conclusion i think this was a big disappoinment and this movie is on the list of afi s 100 greatest films please	negative
if you can t get enough of zombie comedies this year i seriously recommend this one made in the czech republic of all places i saw it at the tribeca film festival \( ny \) and it was tremendous fun bloody funny and smart an intellectual twist on the secluded retreat idea a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives and of course they re overrun by zombies i especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore fest it works on so many different levels while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes the interesting characters and the joyful way it plays with film conventions this is a rare and unusual film to come out of the czech republic i was disappointed that it didn t get a theatrical release in the us so i m really glad that it s coming out on dvd humor horror fans will not be disappointed	positive

these are not the original theatrical realeases in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the color timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels though they are an impressive technical achievement i ll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger	negative
it is obvious that this movie is full of lies although i have not actually seen it i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel \( god bless them \) the way he attacks poor mr heston is deplorable can t michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he doesn t have his faculties about him i am also unsure that mr heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing making it appear that my president \( heston \) is an uncaring babbling idiot by simply using his own words shame on you michael and as for the way he got the gun from the bank i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn t give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank bravo to those who figured that out also michael moore is fat take that pinkie	negative
i agree that this is technically an excellent film but it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with richard widmark s character his enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism but in the end he doesn t just lose he is literally thrown away as garbage and then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take all in all i was left with the question what is the point the commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well its basicly a description of what you re watching while you re watching it i see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so i ll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie	negative
this disk collects the two tales from the crypt movies on one side of a single disk for some reason the menu has the second movie listed first in the first movie billy zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the demons can retake the universe this is the story of his battle with the current demon knight the protector of the key wonderfully crafted and dark the second movie bordello of blood is a more tongue in cheek t a fest and lacks the dark seriousness of the first lilith the queen of all vampires has been awakened she can be controlled by a key \( the one from the first movie \) she has set up a bordello to lure victims to her hunger dennis miller is his wise cracking self as he portrays a down and out private investigator looking for a missing person it is nice not to have to flip the disk over or insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras \( we do get the original trailers \) seeing the two films together really showcases the extreme difference between the two the first is dark well written and well acted the second is gratuitous crass and just not quite as good \( although it is fun in its own way \) now they are together at a reasonable price	positive
for those of you who only saw the new film last year \( i bought it with this sight unseen because it looked interesting and it allowed me to get my favorite free shipping deal \) here s your chance to see the original stories of flicka and her son thunderhead these 3 films which i am told are pretty faithful to mary o hara s novels of the same titles \( i have them too but never read them \) the main difference between them and the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named ken \( rather thank katy mclaughlin well at least the kept the same name in the remake \) and is played by a young roddy mcdowell in the first 2 films and robert arthur in the third the reason he probably didn t do green grass is that the same year \( 1948 \) he was making the second big screen version of robert louis stevenson s kidnapped the first film was released on vhs years ago and both the first 2 had been previously released on dvd to celebrate their 60th anniversaries unfortunately those discs are out of print albeit some amazon sellers are still offering them separately or together but the copies in this set are exactly the same discs except for the pictures on the jackets and the labels on the discs the text on the back of the boxes and list of chapter stops \( on the lists and discs \) are exactly the same as the previous releases this is also the only way to get all 3 \( if you don t count the old copies \) as only the first film has been re released as a separate item \( it also marks the first appearance of green grass on video in any way shape or form \) by the way it was also made into the a short lived tv series in 1956 which i doubt we will ever see again if you like the books and movies of anna sewell s black beauty and walter farley s black stallion and the 2006 remake interests \( or interested you \) get this set before they go out of print again	positive
i was disappointed in this video i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos in other words i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton s antarctic exploration or something from the globe trekker series with that in mind the target audience for this video is not me it is the religious catholic therefore from my perspective i can t recommend it i m not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion i don t enjoy worshipping the holy father or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video if you are not and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican you are likely to be disappointed and that is what these reviews are for to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not	negative
at 23 years of age i can truly say that i have been a lifetime fan of sesame street watching the 3 dvd set of sesame street old school vol 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening because i was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired i expected most of the content to be new to me \( i was barely a year old when mr hooper s death was explained to the world \) but that was not the case many of the short films and interstitials were familiar \( and not just because i used to watch sesame unpaved on noggin \) to me as a viewer from the mid 1980s and i think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning sesame street truly revolutionized children s programming not just because it was educational but because it was \( and remains \) entertaining not pandering i ll admit seeing gordon with an afro orange oscar and the first few tries at big bird s head still freak me out a bit \( as they did when i saw them on noggin several years back \) but the show itself is just as good as i ever remembered something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment \( like transformers or he man or jem \) the set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons and 54 \( the liner notes are incorrect they should have asked count for help \) bonus clips the set also includes the 25 minute pitch film that was made before the series originally aired explaining sesame street s message and motive although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today s pre school children i believe they would probably enjoy classic street even more than the current lineup of shows the fact that today s pre schoolers may be more advanced than the sesame street of yore can really be attributed to sesame street itself and that s pretty cool still i personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults because so many of us associate our childhood with sesame street a booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and i found it informative according to muppet central a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues \( one with stevie wonder one with rogers hammerstein \) but because i never saw the originals i found nothing amiss what astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced no wonder they can t release full seasons although the full length episodes are great my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season seeing kermit sing bein green in its original form the bread milk and butter cartoon and the in in the sky with diamonds parody is a real treat the picture quality is great especially considering the program s age \( and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video although film was used for most of the interstitials \) i doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now the sound quality is good too mono of course but clear and crisp overall i highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved sesame street for those who were born after these episodes aired \( like me \) looking back at the beginning is really special it is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level	positive

and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i m 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i didn t for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what s considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	negative
i often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews 5 stars are really paid biased professionals pumping up the movie for increased dvd sales	negative
instead of reviewing the content my review is based more on the dvd presentation pros the dolby digital 5 1 soundtrack is just excellent with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering sound is only second to the shakira unplugged dvd cons who ever mastered this dvd must be living in 1997 this concert was recorded in hd and is usually shown on mtv hd network the big mistake being that the concert is not anamorphic \( enhanced for 16x9 televisions \) sure the majority will not care but for those of you who own hd monitors you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead because if you try to start from the song selection menu it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends overall a great concert but a disappointing dvd presentation	positive
this is my favorite movie i like it all screenplay director actors etc believe it brilliant	positive
the fake news tv movie had already be done and done better ten years ealier as special bulletin where the first movie took its subject nuclear disarmament and terrorism seriously this cheese fest doesn t respect the viewers intelligence at all they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera not of it ties together in any coherent way and the make love not war ending reeks of junior high school sophistry	negative
i read over some of the other people s opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it my kids ages 6 2 loved this movie from start to finish the music the characters and the story were great for the entire family i definitely recommend this movie for your family s movie collection	positive
this movie works if one of the following four descriptions applies to you 1 you think kevin zegers is hot you want to see anything he s in and the swimming scene in transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first had a peanut butter sandwich 2 you think nick carter is hot and want to see if he can act \( he can t \) 3 you like horror movies no matter how bad they are simply because it s a horror movie 4 for some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested in what judge reinhold is doing with his career within the first five minutes of the film i had it pegged as a friday the 13th style movie within the first five minutes it was then it expanded a bit and we saw some interplay between father and son and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic angst in this rendition the headless horseman actually had a head it was a pumpkin and it growled there was also some serious fire that he was capable of apparently in the beginning this fire was not with him when he needed it the most and of course he used a sword to decapitate victims lucky then that kevin zegers character was on the fencing team \( odd for such a small town to have a fencing team don t you think \) and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end well you get the picture judge reinhold was a riot in the 80s in this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things were when he played ball i can t imagine a universe in which reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his players about he would have died during his first game he did though walk around the house with a football jersey on and some silly pajama pants so i guess that fit the role of a football coach still all in all i was certain that this review would be a one star review then it came out of the jason woods and became marginally better i was interested in the film for two reasons first i m still waiting to see if kevin zegers can act i have a feeling that he s going to break out of the horror mold he s in and become a lesser jamie lee curtis unfortunately in transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager they didn t give him room i e they didn t write anything for him that would have allowed him to express any range either that or he doesn t have any second i do like horror films even bad ones which this was just because i enjoy bad horror films doesn t make it a good movie which this wasn t i was just about to post this review then saw the three four and five star reviews i m sorry what were you guys smoking when you watched this are you kidding me as a bad horror film this succeeds but bad horror films don t get three four or five star reviews it s insane	negative
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes aren t we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast \( from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc \) can turn candy into cuisine	negative
my impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor it s all style no substance i got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks long slow camara pans across stephen dorff s very trendy and stylish haircut and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with despite the very art house feel of it the story is lost the viewer is never quite sure if the philosophy of the main character is meant to be taken seriously and the style is nothing we haven t seen done better other places all in all i found it pretty vapid painfully slow and incredibly frustrating because there is a good movie in here somewhere if only the script had gone to someone else to make on a side note toby maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went	negative
having just read the book \( most highly recommended \) i decided to treat myself to the movie i could have cried while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around in the book the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character in the movie they got rid of one man had the other eaten right off the bat pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy in the book nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters and he does not have an elaborate home on the island and what about those stupid giant animals i don t recall reading about them the fence around nemo s home looks like it came right from jurassic park the whole story was about 5 \( eventually 6 \) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there on another note the graphics were pretty bad the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy as one reviewer well said it is suitable for children who are easily pleased but it is nothing like the book perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only 6 99	negative
this movie was cheeseball beginning to end i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway big mistake a robot who can love lame and with all this high tech stuff the docs can t bring the couple s real son out of a coma \( or whatever was wrong with him \) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can love but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone brialliant plan \( especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world \) then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin the family decides they don t want the robot and the mom loves him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy the worst part was the end ugh i don t even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism for those of you who have not seen it i suggest renting it before you buy it maybe this movie is great for some people it just wasn t my thing	negative
this movie was probably the best one next to lucario and the mystery of mew and jirachi wish maker pokemon ranger centers around the legendary pokemon manaphy and of course ash and his friends some new and amazing characters include buizel jackie the ranger mantyke and chatot the annoying but funny pokemon the villian is great the ending is amazing and the effects were the best yet	positive
i enjoyed this movie a lot hugh jackman and ashley judd are both very appealing in these roles and greg kinnear does a nice job with his as well the jerk who s just so charming that you can t resist even when you know better than to fall for it ellen barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first	positive
i saw the original about 4 5 times from 1970 1971 this one is not much different just modestly i had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years but was unable because the studio \( warner bros \) refused to release it under any format i was thrilled that it was finally released and have since been watching it with many friends most had no idea this movie was ever out i was particularly interested in anita palenburg she has really changed over the last 38 years the content may be a bit provacative for most \( sex and violence \) but the quality are extraodinary for that era this one is a must for anyone	positive

i first caught the black swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away sure it s just a swashbuckler just a pirate film with the usual plot the usual bits and pieces there s nothing outrageously distinctive about the black swan at least at first sight ty power stars as jamie boy expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex pirate and now governer of jamaica captain morgan laird cregar \) morgan s been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers sending jamie boy off to find george sanders captain leech only there s a twist in the mix and some dastardly fop s out to make a mockery of morgan by using leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer to make matters worse jamie not only seemingly disappears apparently in league with the nefarious leech but he also kidnaps the previous governer s daughter played with feistyness by catherien o hara so it s all the usual stuff kidnapping sword fighting stealing drinking pacts with arch enemies and stock characters throughout but you know what it s not that you know what you re getting it s that you get a whole lot more than you ever thought you would sure everything s the same but somehow strangely different the story and characters are as seen before but with the likes of sanders power and o hara as the love interest and the great character actor cregar playing against type you have life breathed into the character s that s so often lacking and the original story by one rafael sabatini who also brought us captain blood and the sea hawk is a rip roaring boys own adventure director henry king no stranger to producing similar adventure styled flicks cracks the picture along with some sense of urgency it s a spare fluid film with a simple but fun narrative and visual splendour that puts other films even those made today out to pasture this dvd manages to capture that splendour in abundance the technicolor photography is gorgeously rendered herein with all of the detailed production and costune design seen at its best just check out the restoration comparison to see how good in addition the disc also features a fine commentary from historian rudy behlmer if you want a cracking piece of entertainment that puts shame to modern counterparts of the genre look no further	positive
my 11 year old saw this movie at school and wouldn t stop talking about it or asking for it since we couldn t find it at any store we amazoned it and there it was part of his christmas present he loves it this movie is very inspiring and from what he says it makes him have hope in other people and what we can do to help others	positive

5 stars to the film itself here s a painful study of a woman s descent to lunacy amidst a desolate uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste the character study is not unlike claustrophobic polanski s repulsion but dwells on vitti s being consumed by her external surroundings as opposed to deneuve s intensive plunge to schizophrenia the pace and landscape is virtual antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who are not familiar with the director s works one of his greatest works \( l avventura remains his best to me \) the only problem is the dvd transfer i ve seen the vhs and it has a consistent hue of orange the dvd although sharper and clearer fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges in long shots for a film that essentially deals with color \( it was antonioni s first color feature \) the transfer was rather clumsy and careless the sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement why didn t criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film	positive
this film is visually stunning and impressive and has talented and credible actors unfortunately there is barely a story with a lot of poorly developed characters who are trained brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity the settings and group sermons from nazi officials are striking and convincing but there is nothing that ties it all together our hero fails to strike the killer blow and is stripped literally and figuratively of all status and walks away the end i m forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film and i was surprised by how un gay it was in fact the two boy friends work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress it s more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else i have issues with some of the pacing as well i found myself pressing the fast forward button several times and didn t really seem to miss much not a good sign so for what it is it s okay certainly not a masterpiece and certainly not something to run out and buy	negative
this is a godawful movie a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the sexy health club craze of the 80s actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so	negative

men of a certain age will remember how when we were kids and this was played on tv in the early 80s we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops but those two over the top scenes are all this movie has going for it the other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter and atop a parking structure both of whom were in can t miss positions and missed anyway moreover if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly it involves eastwood being sent from phoenix to las vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to arizona for a trial the witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the phoenix police commissioner and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup assuming a material witness can be extradited which i doubt the crime appears to have been committed in vegas so it would tried in vegas not phoenix and if the ada prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner he could just dismiss the case and there would be no need to murder the witness the idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous in sum the plot and the action were both absurd and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus but those two scenes probably can t carry the entire movie for the average viewer	negative

this is an excellent story well told in script and action however it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends	negative
jean renoir s masterpiece the grand illusion is truly a film about humanity it is a universal theme something we can all understand and relate to the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler s imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history nevertheless jean renoir s poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb jean gabin is one of the all time great actors jean renoir s innovative approach would influence countless directors to come including orson welles criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd also worth getting is the rules of the game jean renoir s greatest satire	positive
how he makes money acting is amazing to me these hollywood versions of a fake historic events make me cringe especially when hollywood exec s send their talent to making the rounds on talk shows to plug the painful blockbuster that s going to be a big flop and they know it but they think people are stupid \( and most of us are \) but hollywood hates to lose money so they put a spin on it anyway i d laugh if it wern t so sad anyway tom s army unit was choosen to update the japanese army at the request of the puppet emperor but really it s the emperor s councelor who makes all the decisions so the evil councelor decides to westernize his army the samuri swordsmen must be totally destroyed tom accidently on purpose kills a samuri and feels bad so he tries to make it up to the wife and son then he realizes a brutal beauty to the life of a samuri and joins them it s very paint by the numbers story and acting even the japanese landscape is boring of course the u s army is painted as bad guys when the whole blame for the mess and bloodshed that follows can be put squarely on the shoulders of the weak emperor who didn t have the guts to put things right with the samuri in the first place then tommy has some kind of ephifany and decides to stay in japan snore this movie was too long and with all the money spent on this movie it really could have been a 1 2 decent semi historic story about the destruction of the samuri in japan	negative

fraser s film is truly a winner in production quality his attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film eye candy performers lighting fantastic musical score and riske scenes this film has visually appealing sequences if anyone is interested in film and theatrical production i would highly recommend the director s commentary you really get an insight to an artist in process from the commentary it seems that fraser will never be finished with this film a mentale that i admire in an artist art is a process and is never perfect this is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future this film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people i did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide i feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs i had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as selfish gay guy ruins a marriage \( on the other hand cherilee taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script she wasn t quite the victim her character ultimately could have become \) by the end of the film i was wondering how violet was making it as a once again as single woman from an audience s standpoint we didn t really see that david and kryla make up matt goes to illustration school but what happens to violet overall i would highly recommend this film with such a great interpretation on the screen it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres	positive

brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them this is a blatant effort to wrench young children s emotions and therefore their perspectives about the eeeevil effects of global warming by engaging their sympathies the only plot is brainwashing using penguins as the straw man the penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them as a responsible parent i would avoid this entirely	negative

let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language	negative
this film seems to be known worldwide as a chick flick from the romantic aspects of it to the current anniversary dvd s pink cover i m an 18 year old guy who absolutely digs this film especially due to the holly golightly character after viewing this film for the first time i developed a crush on the character holly \( kind of goofy i guess but it s very hard for me to dislike a character like her \) audrey hepburn played her to perfection the film was also brilliantly shot by franz planer and directed by blake edwards i love the film s dialogue as well it has a very realistic quality and it s so fun to hear the characters converse with each other breakfast at tiffany s is perhaps the best date movie ever conceived this film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age	positive
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this	negative
this is a great collection i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on it s truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy but my son is hooked on it now too	positive
i thought this movie was great it s definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie goer it s probably the best dark comedy i ve ever seen \( only to rival the masterpiece that is heathers \) the dialog in this movie with leave you with one liners for years to come after seeing party girl i fell in love with parker posey and when i saw this i loved her even more this instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time but then again i m a huge fan of good dark comedies and i have a sick sense of humor everyone i know absolutely loved this move \( including my mom \) in any event this is a definite must see for any fan of parker posey and dark comedy excellent	positive

this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn t miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i couldn t wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it s that bad it s a shame i love a good suspense horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted	negative
i checked this out because i wanted to take a look at what the new doctor who people have been doing in the recent past the second coming isn t quite as cosmic but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy steve baxter \( christopher eccleston \) has an epiphany one night when he s out on the town with some mates he reckons he s become the son of god and he proceeds to turn night into day at maine road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely chosen status \( a bit like david icke except with powers \) his immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the new disciples some of them notably judith his girlfriend \( lesley sharp \) remain sceptical through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a third testament it later transpires that if they do not the end of the world will soon follow what are this messiah s credentials well he spends forty days in the wilderness which is saddleworth moor and he has no earthly father it turns out that his dad is infertile and couldn t have fathered him this tickled me did writer russell t davis pass his gcse in religious studies do we think i couldn t really work out whether the religious symbolism was unconsciously corny and na ve or whether it aimed at giving us a laugh i d like to think the latter steve curiously isn t what we might describe as spiritual certainly not religious he swears all the time boozes and although not quite loutish is somewhat laddish he s a laddish messiah his disciples swear at him and he insults them back \( message to southerners we in the north are not all like this despite the plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise preston front our friends in the north etc writers do seem to have this desire to patronise us thus \) what s noticeable about the founders of the major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree of religious wisdom steve who just witters nonsensically to the crowds seems to lack this facility is he meant to be devoid of wisdom are we asking too much of russell t davis to place some in his mouth could he have done so had he wished presumably our writer would need to possess some himself \( jury s out \) it turns out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme s message so what happens despite almost two hours of waiting for judgement day with little action or plot development we eventually come to learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib he ends up at the girlfriend s home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or epitome of human religiosity enlightened humanity judith finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him and she spits him out they argue for a while before atheism wins out and steve chomps down the poisoned pasta \( after the two hours i found myself saying bon appetit \) so we get the sermon although it s a secular one which declares the futility of religious belief but this messiah seemed to me to be almost devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway you can t debunk what doesn t exist steve can t be a foil for atheism if he is a kind of atheism i suppose that we do end up questioning russell t davis s understanding of spirituality not to say he should necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality but perhaps to understand it to come degree and yes there is a naivety and a corniness which underpins all this third form philosophy typical of so many young people working within the arts it s a pity that the message of the piece couldn t have been delivered within the actual context of the drama itself what we have is a two hour tv play followed by a secular sermon subtext puked out and all we do have an epilogue however where our new found heroine is hilariously transfigured at the supermarket i do recommend the second coming for amusement but for enlightenment you d better have something else to hand	negative
ladies in lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today this is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful ladies judi dench and maggie smith take on those roles this movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection the movie takes place in a small cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation perhaps isolation from life from emotions and from vulnerabilities the sisters ursula and janet widdington played by dench and smith spend a quiet uninvolved existence venturing out rarely but on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm a bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate this one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions feelings that have been hidden for so many years it is the ability of dench and smith to portray these emotions these feelings for the camera that make this movie sing and the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by daniel bruhl and natascha mcelhone together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening s entertainment	positive
overall this is an extremely awesome concert i am a big fan of dt and like pretty much all their stuff the performance itself is pretty good although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and jordan s keyboard solo other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album if they had done more special things it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4 other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance but would say they did okay as far as that goes sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them the special features are also pretty good but i would not buy this concert just for those backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves overall i did think it was pretty cool and i would recommend buying it if you like dream theater or just their genre of music in general	positive
i should have left this review a long time ago i could kick myself for buying it thinking it was a film not a religous object if you critisize this film amongst religious radicals you risk being burned at the stake an act of love to purify your soul this film as a film disregarding the topic is a dog a cheap b grade blood spurting flesh flying horror flick in aramaic with sub titles i could go on for an hour but won t bother	negative
why the production team of this movie didn t film in new orleans is beyond my comprehension when i first saw this movie i could see based on the footage that it was filmed in canada the terrain is totally different from south louisiana it looked like a movie set i guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other it looked like a theme park the streets looked too clean for some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old new orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people s lives but maybe i am being too technical all the principle characters all had straight teeth and clear skin back in the 1840 s just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it the actor who played marcel could not act the actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years still looked the same yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before the architecture of the plantation house was also wrong it was nt even french no live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern louisiana the supporting actors and actresses were quite good let me just say this white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in new orleans but also other states in the south the difference is is that in new orleans the white master would leave them property and money not so in other southern states the more beautiful the woman the more she would receive from the white man the placage system in new orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties	negative
most people that like wes anderson s films are rabid fanatics and i m no exception so when the chance came to buy his first feature length film for 7 i snapped it up if you enjoyed life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums you ll enjoy this on some levels too many of anderson s classy touches are already in evidence in this film the story is fun and the characters are well developed yeah pretty much buy it if you like the wilson brothers or wes anderson the high point of the movie is certainly luke wilson s character masterfully done even in his first role	positive

while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid summer weather we ended up renting analyze that and boy what a mistake that was we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 s analyze this the potential was there it s not as if writers \( of course it s never a good sign to see numerous writers \) peter tolan peter steinfeld and harold ramis didn t have decent material to work with robert deniro billy crystal lisa kudrow and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy however this being hollywood and all another sequel was botched it s because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some fish out of water situations the movie seemed to go downhill soon after the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over the top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as crossroads now either they ran out of jokes they didn t have enough time to invest in an actual story or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already \( the sopranos the whole 9 yards mickey blue eyes etc etc \) that there was simply nothing left to write about	negative

when paul mccartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience it usually for more than just the average oh i have an album to promote let me go on tour his 1989 tour was paul s first time onstage in many years and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his beatles wings years but he also still was able to create a deep personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can this spawned the excellent double live album tripping the live fantastic as well as the exciting concert movie get back his 2002 american tour was a chance for paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on september 11th the cd and dvd back in the u s were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy in 2005 paul did something that had long been awaited since the beatles first hit ever since the cold war the beatles were a huge phenemenon in russia however there communist government considered their music alien propoganda and their music was outlawed still the russian citizens got their hands on the beatles recordings any way they could and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them making them belive there was a free world beyond the iron curtain over 40 years later paul ventured to moscow to perform a historic concert in red square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment the concert was filmed and was aired on a e as paul mccartney live in red square this is quite simply an excellent concert movie paul and his band are in top form paul clearly wanted to give the russian fans a night they d never forget pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as band on the run live and let die back in the u s s r hey jude and let it be as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as two of us i ve just seen a face and let em in mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how the beatles music had such a connection with the russians during the cold war and why they still remained so popular these interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers as an added bonus we get another concert of paul in st petersburg this is once again an excellent energetic and fun show that shows why paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world the sound and picture quality are excellent and the special features are a nice treat live in red square is an excellent dvd that belongs in everyone s collection	positive

ok so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina s breasts the acting was poor the script was stupid and the sets were lame i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time \( ie killer kondom \) but this one took the cake i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day save your money if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week	negative

i saw this movie years ago but didn t remember much about it except some of the songs and the basic story i also saw nights of cabiria from which the story was taken i love musicals and i think shirley maclaine is very talented she is very sweet as charity hope valentine and one can t help wanting a happy ending for her so why did i think this movie was awful first of all some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating how many times can you listen to charity say fickle finger of fate over and over without wanting to hit the mute button also some of the scenes went on and on and on especially the elevator scene and the intermission was totally unnecessary but the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers i didn t like any of them they were so far over the top as to be silly bob fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers he had so much busyness in all of them too many people costumes that didn t fit the story silly moves and they all went past the point of enjoyment i fast forwarded thru a couple of them just to get them over with i have never done that before with any movie this could have been so much better the story was good the charactors were good but the whole thing should have been toned down the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming it was entirely too long also all that stop action what was that all about i know i know it was to show the progress of the story but it was a distraction i didn t like the movie and was glad when it was over	negative
though this movie is not the stage version it is just as good bill benson \( bing crosby \) and ted adams \( donald o conner \) decide to do a broadway show together however they need a leading lady well ted and the director decide that if bill should run across the right girl sign her so bill sets off to paris and ted for london well bill discovers a girl \( mitzy gaynor \) not knowing that ted found and signed a girl in paris \( jeanmaire \) when the two find out it is total chaos especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home all the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave things seem to be going fine until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady the movie has great porter songs de lovely anything goes second hand turban blow gabe blow i get a kick out of you you re the top and a fabulous tap number with donald you can bounce right back phil harris also stars in this fantastic de lovely movie	positive
this is a thuroughly enjoyable movie a pleasure to watch the acting characters and story are entirely plausible and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors nor is there any of hollywood s usual political preachiness \( especially unusual considering robert redford s backing \) the only downside to the dvd is that it is full screen and not letterboxed the bonus features are somewhat lack luster as well and the menu system is laughable only one actor s credits have been updated since the movie was released and the credits section is a token gesture at best still this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice	positive
i saw this back in 1985 when if first came out it was wonderful at first i thought it was going to be one of those historical tourist shows but it wasn t it could have been though mr wood is a very charismatic presenter but is what s better is that he took the story of the story of the trojan war from the pages of modern myth to reality i have read homer and i knew about schlieman but other than that i was ignorant of the trojan war mr wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level i was fascinated by the connection he made to the hittite empire the thought had never occurred to me that if a troy did exist it might have trade relations with empires to the east he also included experts in the fields of archeology modern history and history of the period i thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times i also have the alexander dvd and shakepeare in search of shakespeare was fun wood took the story of shakespeare down to the center of his human story i would recommend all the wood in search of programs if you can t find the films then read the books the books are just are entertaining	positive

this is one of the best g3s maybe even the best i would have said that it was definitely the best if not for mr malmsteen the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales but i don t want to be nice i want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to malmsteen he knows alternate picking i ll give him that but then so do i and a million others he shouldn t be up there playing with vai and satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most \( not all \) people and yet he is he shows over and over again in this show that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more that s all one of the interesting things about this dvd is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that yngwie chooses to execute it s less than about a second and this is an average figure enough about yngwie though he is the reason i m writing this review satriani is absolutely amazing as usual with a brand new rendition of midnight and a nice solo at the end of starry night vai though steals the show this coming from a guy who prefers satriani but i can t help it he is really that good and better i know you re here \( which he plays on a triple neck jem \) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you re taught at guitar school it is also the best song steve vai has ever written after fire garden suite juice and i m the hell outta here are also really really really good overall a great dvd though you should probably skip the parts with yngwie in it	positive
i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen what bothers me the most is that the general public who hasn t read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject i won t go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie	negative
all style and no substance even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster and would cedric the entertainer please go away i ve never seen anything with him in it that was any good i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud i think christina milian s voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over	negative
by the title i would be led to believe that there is more than one george story there is one george and a few others one of which scares my 2 1 2 year old i thought the stories would be animated however some \( including george \) are pictures from a story book we love to read books but videos should be more than photos of a story book would not recommend this	negative
i don t consider myself a hardocre 50 cent fan but i went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of xxl it wasn t all that entertaining the documentary doesn t really tell the people anything that we don t already know we ve seen all these videos before but the video for heat is straight wack the street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny the show in detroit isn t entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that s being said the sessions aol are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 mile dvd trailer the dvd borders on corny but the cd isn t that bad these are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs but i had not been able to find the 8 mile road \( g unit remix \) ever since i lost my underground cd lloyd banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this cd dvd release if you re a young buck fan you should know that he s nowhere to be found on this release overall the new breed isn t completely terrible but it loses its novelty after one or two uses the three songs on the cd are decent but you probably have them already i would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 cent g unit fans	negative

we all feel alone at times this is something lost in translation brilliantly shows its audience indeed loneliness often paradoxically occurs in highly populated areas it is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel the more our differences stand out bill murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy who dosen t seem to quite know why he is where he is and why he is treated the way he is in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality this is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola it captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top this also sort of represents the zenith of bill murray s career and perhaps his best performance to date	positive
when kerouac ginsberg and burroughs set out in their writing they had no idea what it would create a whole movement this film including interviews taken when ginsberg and burroughs were alive assembles clips from media film and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats up to the passing away of ginsberg and burroughs with a large assembly of other beat writers and the poets they influenced \( carroll and bukowski \) it is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement it is interesting to see the beat propaganda of the sixties how negative and mocking the media treated the sense of a cool movement they painted a false portrait this film is for lovers of beat or people genuinely interested however if you do not like documentaries you won t like this one also i was disappointed to see depp hopper and turturro reciting long pieces of work when the actual writers could have performed it honestly i skipped these parts i wanted to see ginsburg doing howl another disappointment is the dvd version which was slapped together on the fly i envisioned additional clips and useful information \( let s face it you can put tons on a dvd \) but only had 2 or 3 screens of names credited for making the movie and the trailer \( in this case not exciting \) however with all disappointments aside this film is good for a few viewings it conveys a better picture of the beats than other films have before and enjoyed alot of the material	positive
i remember way back in 80 when this movie was the buzz of hollywood that is the buzz on johnny carson the media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself yet in the mid 80 s it came out on both betamax and vhs and naturally i bought me a beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was first it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption it is long and intraclly woven together it is lavish and sometimes loud it is a brutal slap in the face to manifest destiny and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is god s country as if their god gave them wealth and privilige and that this god justifies revolution massacre and war many comparisons can be mase with the america of the late 19th century and the america ruled presently by king george w and his robber barons of capitalism but it is now as then much more conveniant to steer the common man into their churches into their army into their lies the enemy is those illegal aliens those in the gay agenda those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo kris kristofferson plays a mayor sherriff if wealth and means who \( shock shock \) sides with the common man and the undertrodden when another of his breeding and class challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class he replies to the creep you are not of my class to be of my class you first have to die and be born again this is a revolutionary movie meant to be savored each and every minute of it this movie dares you to look at things usually not into history books or shown on the history channel	positive
i really didn t enjoy the movie but i had to finish it the hypocrisy of faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so called fundamentalist that i know but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying this movie presented a very perverted view of christianity though there was alot of talking about jesus and saying his name it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually knew him and spent time with him when mary gets a revelation from something she believes is christ that opposed the actual word of god she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against his word no one actually reads a bible in the movie consequently most made many life damaging decisions i hated the reality of the movie but it has challenged me to actually spend time with christ and learn about him i shudder to think that i could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what christianity truly is	negative
i showed this movie to my students they had red the book and this was reenforcement fore the lesson they really enjoyed it	positive
i m a big fan of the sopranos so obviously the f word doesn t bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the f word and mf the stories and characters are superficial boring and unintelligent people who like this show are the same people who think that what makes the sopranos a great show is because people get whacked a lot	negative
from a serious u2 fan s perspective the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs the bonus material is cool the sound quality s great the visuals are always impressive but it s the songs that are the real attraction as it should be two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album boy four in a row from the all time masterpiece achtung baby and nearly everything from their grammy sweeping triumph how to dismantle an atomic bomb i also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums good call also many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments such as running to stand still \( a perfect hybrid of the joshua tree and zoo tv versions \) elevation \( longer better build up \) bullet the blue sky \( check out edge s extended blues jam in the final minutes \) and original of the species \( acoustic piano ballad \) this was the first major u2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list for instance when i saw them they played miss sarajevo stuck in a moment gloria i still haven t found what i m looking for instant karma until the end of the world and others not represented here here s hoping they release at least one more vertigo tour dvd	positive
firstly don t let the dvd region 1 status put you off i am in australia and this disc played perfectly on my pc dvd player and even the ps2 it s wonderful to finally see an intimate performance by elvis costello on dvd it brought so many memories of his tour in 2004 back to me elvis fans will love this dvd featuring his latest music along with many oldies it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man elvis gives 100 of himself on stage a must for your music dvd collection	positive
this dvd is a great complement to the dvd s offered by vce \( trinity and beyond nukes in space etc \) by itself it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials military equipment and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the dvd set the quality of the film varies between the three discs the last civil defense video on disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble unfortunately but it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format i ve owned trinity and beyond for several years and i really enjoy the way it is presented but it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures etc you begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement after watching this dvd i have a much better understanding of the entire process it s easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program the science of the atomic bomb was a moving target and this dvd outlines the research they made though i would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again their sheer power is fascinating beautiful and frightening at the same time if you are interested in the science of atomic testing you should really take a look at this set	positive
clownhouse is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor while hearing of salva s conviction when jeepers creepers came out i never knew it had anything to do with this movie nor had i ever heard of this in the first place i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides it and came across this weird little halloween like suspense tale while the sex scandal never once popped into my head \( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid \) i still didn t care for this too much despite its pluses like halloween this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out but sadly it didn t really get to me if i was about 9 or so this would ve scared the hell out of me i m not saying i hated this it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children it lost some effect for me i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on and it would ve been a creepier experience horror movie fans should like this even though i personally thought it would be better the atmosphere is very very creepy and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way but it just didn t do it for me rent it first	negative
very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery	positive
the whole point of this ghost story is like in the orinigal a surprise twisted ending yet once again in a 90 s hollywood horror flick it is dissappointing the actors within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect but there not to blame the blame is the poor script writing for this movie the movie has you going until about half way through when they introduce the ghost to you now unlike any other ghost in hollywood history this ghost is literally a black blob it contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face which in turn reveals the face of whom it kills but literally when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie you better make sure its in the right one this movie should probably been called the blob not house on haunted hill it is a horrible re make and a waste of about 2 hours please for your own sake rent some good genre horror like halloween or when a stranger calls not some crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching it in better luck next time to the director producer co producer and writer of this film because of all the people that took part probably just wanted to make some cheap money so they made a movie better luck next time	negative
this has to be the worst thing they could do if you really believe in the lord do not but this movie it is based on many lies first off noah didnt save lot and his wife from sodom and gomorrah abraham did and it was at least 350 years after the flood that this happen and after the tower of babel but they have noah in sodom and gomorrah and then moving on and building the ark after its destruction they also show a pedlar in a boat coming up to the ark once everything is flooded and they have lot on a ship attacking noah for his ark it is a half truth and in my opinion a mockery and i will never buy anything again that has the name hallmark on it how dare they sell such a lie to peopl	negative
dmx stars as the drug dealer king david who pops up in the streets again after a long absence rolling into the frame in a player s classic a late 70 s stutz blackhawk king david shrugs his way back into the hard knock life he quickly reaps what he sows and mortally wounded passes all his worldly goods to paul \( david arquette \) a scrambling white would be writer king david s estate includes an audio journal of his life which provides flashbacks and a narrative within a narrative that answers the shaken paul s curiosity it s the highlights of king david s high life that propel alone like all of goines s heroes king david is a scourge on the periphery and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity every life he touches he leaves in ruins a need to deface beauty as a result of self loathing is implicit and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility to say that king david is the best part he s ever had is an understatement he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist	positive
it is almost ashame that north amercian culture needs bill maher after all shouldn t honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is on victory begins at home maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind maher s central premise that the war on terrorism can be aided by what people do in the united states really is almost a common sense arguement yet maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match maher does this by not pretending he isn t politically opinated in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on the rarity of straight forward unabashed opinion on victory begins at home he is more democrat then republican but he openly sides with neither instead he rails at all presenting himself as a full person neither liberal nor conservative right wing or left wing the end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered there is no spin here what maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it with all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media political columnists and special interest groups know wonder we need him so much	positive
the most simple definition of is sexual gratuitousness sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on not providing anything pertinent to the plot you can t help but get a porno feel while watching bully and to think i was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl s crotch while she s driving a car was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes you can t help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story the very first scene is of a guy having phone sex several things about this movie other than the made me mad 1 you re planning to kill somebody then proceed to tell everybody including the waitress at pizza hut what you re planning 2 after you kill you re so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting very strange and telling even more people what you did 3 which makes more sense to decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend or to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh ore bobby never put a gun to the guy s head to make him hang out with him yet murder was the only option 4 i can t believe mr wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy s throat while he s staring him blankly in the face begging for his life 5 all of the characters	negative
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those aren t basinger s legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd s characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that s no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he doesn t have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step mother is not like other people basinger s character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think jar jar blinks i suppose it s ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that s it flat and mechanical	negative
the perpetrators of a high level corporate scandal \( masayuki mori takashi shimura ko nishimura \) are pursued by the illegitamate son \( toshiro mifune \) of a low level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes but do they really sleep well	positive

the ab portion of the dvd is good although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set the last one is a step type exercise so if you don t have something you can step up on you can t do it the dvd itself is not very professionally done tamilee miscounts doesn t look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words abs of steel maybe buns of steel no way	negative
i don t own a copy of the original cut and it s been a while since i ve seen the original cut a short review of this version is as follows the film print is flawless in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70 s or 80 s on purpose the blue filter is gone so it doesn t look slick and shiny this film is dark rich and grungy very noir ish and warm obviously the running gag through out the first film was that porter wants his 70k back not 130k or 1 million just 70k this was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it the first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again porter in this film is not charming or smooth he s smart violent and cold a true anti hero the annoying voice over narration is gone there are several new characters and several new brutal kills minus the credits this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes this is a great companion piece to the great to live and die in l a it got the same mood i told you this review was going to be short	positive

there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film but as a whole it just didn t quite work for me vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character fanda a maddening yet adorable grandpa oh so young at heart oh so mischievious and impish but somehow oh so good hearted and harmless that you can t help loving him warts and all in fact that s one of the fatal flaws of this movie the lack of any dark side to any of the characters they re all basically harmless walt disney types even the bumbling and self absorbed son there are no real consequences to brodsky s actions other than stella \( his wife \) finally talking divorce but it s obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she ll come back to him there is no center no force or dynamic power in this film it s like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don t want to hurt the feelings of your host the ending also relies on another lazy device the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice supporter of fanda s when she sees that his attempt at self reform is only making him miserable this film might ve been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda s desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death instead of focusing on how clever audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse narcissism one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr brodsky who is a towering figure among czech actors that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him a more accurate title for this movie especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll might be the fantasy life of a poor old man	negative
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here \( crash comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world \) my beefs are not the same as most of those who don t like the film i don t much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it isn t depressing at all cause i didn t care it s just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here s a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i don t like any of these people so their pain doesn t mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would ve worked but now there just isn t anything there as far as what s actually in the movie we ve got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we ve got jared s mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto s friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there s no real attempt to make wayans into a person he s got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that s it the doubly sad fact is that he s the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it s a wonder that the smack doesn t cause them to cease to exist entirely \( well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually like the bergman films i ve seen so that s not really a fair comparison \) they love each other apparently but since i don t even like either of them i m not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it wouldn t have been funny if i cared about her but we ve been over that and i want you people to know that i m not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie s dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting which has drug addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba ho tep a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that s all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream isn t helped any by darren aronofsky s repetitive derivative over direction the trouble is this movie hasn t got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there s nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they re hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see fast motion a thousand times quick cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera attached to the actor junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain t drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that doesn t make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky wasn t going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters weren t going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that s a good ending grade d ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows	negative

i m sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target to imply that christians are typically mean and narrow minded is pure racism this is just as evil as implying that all jews are rich or that all african americans have rhythem what has jesus himself done to warrant such christian bashing out of hollywood the man has suffered enough on the cross leave him alone	negative
alyssa milano s mother \( who is also her manager \) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet she s denounced such websites exploitation on national tv and has even developed a side business as a cybercop lending her web busting skills to other stars milano s mother manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film embrace of the vampire is softcore horror porn and the source for many of those milano skin pics after tv s who s the boss was canceled \( but before charmed returned milano to star status \) milano was just another unemployed former child actress so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody two shoes girl she d played in who s the boss in other words she wanted to grow as an actress so she did embrace of the vampire in which she goes topless in several scenes engages in a lesbian romp with charlotte lewis and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body mission accomplished actually embrace of the vampire uses milano s virginal image from who s the boss by casting her as a virgin a virgin whose boobs are straining against her too tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend \( albeit asking him not to look \) but still a virgin a virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn t know why here s why milano is the reincarnation of martin kemp s true love some 300 years ago a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy now that he s rediscovered milano he has three nights to rekindle her love for him if so they will live forever as vampires if not he dies and loses her forever why the sudden three night deadline why not the plot and motivations are paper thin as is typical of porn milano wanders around campus wondering why she s having so many sexual dreams even daydreams her boyfriend wanders about wondering if she s so pure kemp wanders about seen by milano but often not by others lewis wanders about for some bisexual action other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action amid all this wandering there s much carnal action and more carnal dreaming occasionally kemp kills someone for dissing milano john stanley \( in his creature features movie guide \) correctly refers to it as a meandering almost formless script kemp has the best lines like many vampires he agonizes and suffers a hyper romantic vampire angst over a lost love his appearance is a touch effeminate \( too much eyeliner \) but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character he is part romantic vampire part bloodthirsty beast lewis s small part is pointless to the story all that s required is that she undress and when she does it was worth the wait rachel true \( the craft \) has an even smaller role the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on all of the above three are more interesting more charismatic than milano or her boyfriend at film s end kemp s tearful bloodthirsty angst and milano s tearful rediscovery of her love the tragic star crossed ending and the christian iconography all mirror coppola s bram stoker s dracula \( 1992 \) one senses that director goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material however this is no poor woman s bram stoker s dracula milano is no winona ryder and kemp is no gary oldman for that matter none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts and the budget just isn t there the strength of low budget horror is a gritty authenticity which this film tries to hide rather than utilize how low was the budget listen i was an extra on both bram stoker s dracula and embrace of the vampire \( in both instances i kept my clothes on \) i worked one day on embrace of the vampire don t look for me i ended up on the cutting room floor and extras are rarely mentioned in credits but let me tell you an inside story on the making of this film we were shooting in a nightclub on the sunset strip the extras were divided into three camps union nonunion and modesto extras union extras earn the most especially once overtime kicks in so they were wrapped after eight hours \( they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota \) this was during my nonunion days \( i m in sag now \) so i put in a full 14 hours after which we were paid in cash and wrapped the modesto extras were still working when we left now what you may ask is a modesto extra i also wondered and so i asked one i was told they were from an acting class in modesto california they had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a class assignment in other words they were paying to come to work there s not a whole lot to learn about being an extra it s neither glamourous nor difficult and nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are very easy to come by the lampposts in los angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle ehr extras i did it for the cash and because if you do it often enough you increase your chances of getting into the union \( which i did after some 13 grueling months \) never pay for the chance to be an extra not in los angeles i made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times but wised up after a few months my guess is the producers of embrace of the vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle and far less than even nonunion extras cost i know this teacher was getting paid by the students and that they were not getting paid to be on the film another inside story someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member she was near tears because it had sentimental value never leave anything of value lying around on a set and some trivia john stanley says this film was originally conceived as the nosferatu diaries but on the set we were told the working title was the collector embrace of the vampire is a decent time killer barely if you re looking for horror there are hundreds of better films dozens of better vampire films even many superior erotic vampire films vampyres \( british 1975 \) comes to mind but if you re looking for milano nudies this is the film to see	negative
just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the dvd it s fullscreen and doesn t have any special features now if you ve seen the scenes that weren t included in the extended vhs but were for some reason on the cable version you d see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie i d really like to see this one get maybe a double dvd release with when nature calls souped up and some of those great missing scenes including ace singing onstage with cannibal corpse \( funniest scene in the whole movie i thought \) ace conversing with a few drunks in ray finkle s hometown and some others	negative
this is one of the better historical dramas from the 1970s many are stagey and slow and while this production of madame bovary is very much constrained to stay indoors this works to advantage for this story of a woman who feels so trapped by her life and her world emma bovary is not a very sympathetic creature she is married to a man who loves her with all his heart who tries to give her everything she wants is willing to ruin himself to make her happy and she still cheats on him and remains miserable in short she is selfish and inconsiderate as ugly inside as she is pretty on the outside francesca annis plays emma she is indeed very beautiful as an actress she often comes across as bright and hard flirty and flighty but cold and self satisfied these qualities of course are perfect for this character here she seems to be more in love with the idea of being in love than actually loving almost anything to break up the dismal tedium of her life and her disgust with everyone and everything in it it is very hard for a modern audience to feel sorry for her her daily trial does not include housework or drudgery she has maids for that she is bored because she is useless she is useless because she is too lazy to seek something meaningful to do she wants life to be a party and resents it when it is not tom conti plays her devoted husband who is completely devoid of ambition in work or society as an actor conti often seems to have just woken from a nap and this dampness is just right for dr bovary he too is very lazy in his way but his seems to stem from ignorance when contrasted with emma s willfulness her husband seems the infinitely better of the two conti is really fine here as a man completely out of his depth with this racehorse of a wife in much the same way while annis is briskly carrying every scene conti just quietly steals every one of them a perfect pairing for these roles all the actors here are top notch and the casting a bit off beat which adds to the interest the costumes especially emmas are a luxurious parade of overindulgence absolutely beautiful while we as an audience enjoy the parade of finery we can also see how this wardrobe would drive even the richest man into the poorhouse the production is topped off with a novel and lovely score of predominantly piano compositions pretty and liltling but melancholy and dissonant don t let this one get lost in the shuffle it is worth seeing	positive
with season 4 the series starts to slide a little i don t think the show is weaker it s just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already look i love the godfather one and two but three is just not as good the total time it takes to watch the first two godfather films is a little over 5 hours that won t even get you through season one of the sopranos i hope i speak for everyone out there when i say that as good as the sopranos is it will never come closed to the godfather movies so i guess it is just starting to get old i will certainly be watching the finale episodes i just hope it isn t too big a let down for those who are interested the dvd set has great transfers but few interesting extras	positive
i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars but after watching it again i realized i liked it better \( i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you \) i do not consider all of the performances goth martiya possesion are more tribal than anything \( at least on this video \) and i really dislike the expression or lack thereof on their faces while they are dancing they either look completely bored pissed off or smug i skip right over it i also did not care for asharah s dance to the drum solo by solace \( opaque \) the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all the music is saying fast big upbeat and she s standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves and of course we all love the s m piece excuse me s m is not part of the goth subculture and has no place on a bellydance video jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer but she didn t dance much on this and i didn t want to see what was on her part another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music i like solace and all but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre there were a few but not enough for my liking my favorites on this video were tempest ariellah jeniviva and ayshe \( for wierdness factor \) for all of its faults this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose	positive

i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go s a bit fast but i know i could get used to it but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it	negative
one could review kingdom of heaven on a lot of levels as an action packed medieval adventure romance as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors or as a statement about humanity s less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn t lead to warfare with people of differing points of view i was expecting mostly the first two and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third my favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling i ve had about spirituality for some time now god will understand my lord and if he doesn t then he is not god and we need not worry why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not i don t know and when i heard these words coming from the screen i realized someone out there understands we don t find god in books or doctrine or sermons we know god in our hearts or not at all this character looked to his heart and knew god will understand and anyone who doesn t is surely not god no matter what someone else might claim and if you loved the movie you ll enjoy this dvd it s a classy widescreen handling of a film that s visually rich and deserves to be seen in it s cinematic format with gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming i can t imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form	positive

modigliani \( 2004 \) is a self indulgent pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist writer director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work ironically the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani despite his boundless enthusiasm andy garcia is simply too old for the title role an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight to video fate	negative
i really wanted to give superman volume 3 a full 5 stars but unfortunately the quality control of the dvd release is poor hence the 1 star rating the dvd set i purchased skipped at the green lantern episode the replacement i got also skipped at the same place in addition the two sided disc format with which all three dvd volumes have been released is a damage prone format luckily i was able to get a full refund but at this point i m not sure if or when i ll try my chance at buying this set again the lack of quality control is too bad because volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series if you are fortunate enough to get a dvd set free of defects then you are really in for a treat bruce timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to superman as they did on batman the animated series of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain darkseid throughout the series it finally gets put front and center in several episodes of volume 3 and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale i felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series	negative
first let me start off by saying this ken sushi volume 1 is unquestionably the best video guide for making sushi i have had a chance to see the other guides and quite frankly they just don t cut it poor camera work and even worse instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video \( or any culinary instructional video for that matter \) also being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly \( people want to learn from someone experienced not enthusiastic \) finally we have a video that is taught by a professional in the sushi scene and he really takes the time to lay out all the techniques he s developed over the years so that with a little practice \( and the benefit of not having to take the time ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi creation \) i was actually able to make some really great sushi the camera work is great no shakes or stutters i didn t find myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality truthfully this video is done so well you will just find yourself immersed in what ken is teaching \( it plays a lot like a chef martin yan instructional video \) also it seems a lot of time was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi creation yet developed enough so that someone completely new to the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a wholesome delicious dish if you take the time to watch the video a few times and practice along with it you will make sushi good enough to eat and present to your friends family \( just utterly show off \) i m just really glad i can finally say there is now a sushi instructional video that i feel was worth every penny of my purchase if you want to really learn how to make sushi well then ken sushi volume 1 will be your number one resource the only negative thing i have to say is where the heck is volume two	positive

i watched the first half hour of this and couldn t get through it i dislike michael moore as much as anybody but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school it s an amateurish whining documentary made more for spite \( and those 15 minutes we all want \) than anything else getting called down by michael moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside \( people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night \) doesn t prove that michael moore followers are all waffling malcontents dude overall i rate this film fail	negative
unlike many of the reviewers here i m not a biblical expert and really don t care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible i would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally the biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out there were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story \( and in some cases detracted from it \) for instance during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water everyone goes a bit crazy that s an acceptable premise but it s played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors the idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn t have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play there were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water \( between lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water \) which undermined the entire story of the great flood everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats it was just plain silly and again seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary spice \( it didn t work as a means of jazzing up the story \) i m guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals this type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad to the movie s credit the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn t work	negative
i rarely write reviews but quoting ebert \( who inexplicably liked this \) i hated this movie 1 is editor the correct term to apply to joe klotz i give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4 if you want to see a good slow paced movie watch l aaventura for a much better recent indie film about family life buy the squid and the wale 2 if the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well amy adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb but sweet southerner \( see forrest gump waterboy \) i guess her performance reaffirmed what hollywood thinks of the south notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from california or ny does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs 3 i assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism i feel bad for the masochists but not the pretentious pseudo intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit 4 rent this first and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not 19 9	negative

i don t know how this skunk got 4 and 1 2 stars on amazon let alone one i could hear hepburn bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom i think this is mainly because of ford s linus he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake the film critics said that while the original sabrina was about her transformation this version was about linus transformation but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end there was a merger and you were in the way no hard feelings is very cold compared with bogart s would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it in the original you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man you don t get that here at all	negative

american gigolo stars richard gere of a high priced male prostitute he is coasting along with his rich southern cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered when he is considered the main suspect he goes on the run with his only friend being the wife of a politician at the begining he tells people that he is a moral man for example he dosn t service gays more on that in a moment it is interseting to note that gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in pretty woman and it made a star out of julia roberts but that is where the similarities end this is a much darker story about hypocracy when he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him in the end he finds himself a hypocrit because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job gays s and m anything to avoid jail the only love story here is about him and the politician s wife \( lauren hutten \) it is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him even for his own protection for all it s darkness there is one funny scene richard gere is called in for a line up at the police department he tells the other men in the line up that he got paid and the others get angry and cause a scene averting the attention off of gere this is a really good movie as an examination of society s attitude toward sex this film was written and directed by paul schrader if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to taxi driver richard gere is wooden but his character is cold and icy so that approach is right lauren hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man she seems sincere in wanting to help gere but i thought the standout performance was bill duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing \( as oppose to gere s madam \) but also provides the warning to gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out and another future pretty woman player is present hector elanzo he plays the detective on gere s trail but he is slimy and rather unlikable here well worth your time but for adults only	positive

i was introduced to the matthew shepard story by mtv s dramatic presentation of matthew s last days in laramie with that as my background i entered the laramie project with curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie s townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention matthew was a human being undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents but not everyone shared that view that fact was refreshing the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent other laramie residents were just as horrified the so called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected but equally unnerving this film though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed has the feel of a documentary knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times but the presentation was enlightening the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that crimes no matter what a person s viewpoint lifestyle or background no one has a right to take on the position of punisher humans are not animals or at least they shouldn t act like them the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder it is worth the watch	positive

fast times at ridgemont high is a clever insightful and wicked film it is not just another teen movie though to the casual observer it might be no it is a time capsule into the socal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late 70 s and 80 s as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the u s circa 1982 sean penn \( whom i m not a big fan of \) as jeff spicoli is truly inspired i find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes what an awesome character when he says you d ck to ray walston s mr hand \( another inspired and forever memorable character \) you just wanna roll on the floor jennifer jason leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality phoebe cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly mature relationship anyone has \( with a college boy \) is fresh and believable judge reinhold as leigh s older brother is inspired mike damone is a sleaze and a great character \( if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to \) in fact this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars the script by a very young cameron crowe is brilliant fast times came out at roughly the same time as the last american virgin and several years after rock and roll high school neither of those other films is anywhere on par with fast times at times light and airy fast times carries a serious message that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how it is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film the adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home truly teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents while last american virgin approached some of the same topics that fast times does it did it in a more sinister way fast times doesn t gloss over teen age problems but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his herself deals with them yes it s a comedy and yes it is funny but it is not just a film for kids	positive
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies	negative

othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times in the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done the story of othello is that of a venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman the general happens to be black in an effort to sabotage the general iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death while shakespeare gives motivations for his characters interpretations and emphases tend to vary kenneth brannagh s production of othello emphasies iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so this production with ian mckellan in the role of iago puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in being bad wheras the latter seems more inclined to get even both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure the role of desdemona is portrayed in this version by imogen stubb and she is a delight to watch she bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic so too is the title role played admirably the problem with othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence this is a fine performance all around with a difficult play if you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check it is well worth the time	positive
richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout \( along with partner emilio estevez \) of pretty madeleine stowe \( they have to watch her house through the night \) and he falls in love with her before the movie is over there s a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer \( aidan quinn \) it s pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie but the script is above average especially the dialogue and dreyfuss s performance is right on target a very entertaining movie definitely worth a watch	positive

this is the first movie i remember seeing as a kid i loved it it was my favorite then i didn t get to see it again for several years \( stupid blockbuster \) when i finally saw it again i still liked it i like it as i write this very day the music is good \( the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to but helps the mood anyway \) the animation s good too and i actually know what i m talking about \( how often does that happen \) see what happens a lot of the time is that people blame colors they don t like or designs that are annoying or whatever on the animation but it isn t the animation s fault the way the thing on screen moves is the only thing the animators do mostly so if you really want to criticize the animation look at how they move not what they look like do you see i think that really most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about books when i was little my dad read me the lion the witch and the wardrobe and the hobbit things like that so naturally i loved books and stories this is practically the only movie i ve seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere it s obvious that the filmmakers themselves \( or at least a lot of the people working on it \) actually like to read that s really why i like the pagemaster so if you like to read watch this movie if you don t \( you utter nincompoop \) stay away and don t criticize what you have no comprehension of	positive

millionaire fredrick loren played by a young vincent price invites five strangers to a party in the house on haunted hill with his delectable wife annabel in tow he has set the strangers a task of sorts if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them 10 000 each however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted one of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing at midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the house on haunted hill takes on a life of its own but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun i enjoyed this film it wasn t overly suspenseful but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then the special effects were none existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house all in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same	positive
the petrified forest is a filmed version of the 1935 broadway smash the play starred leslie howard and humphrey bogart and their stage performances were preserved when warner brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935 the addition of bette davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with howard after their earlier matching in of human bondage the film is set in the arizona desert a killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there the play has a few things to say about the meaning of life with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual alan squier played by leslie howard and vicious gangster duke mantee played by humphrey bogart the morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of leslie howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance the film was a breakthrough for bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career she is also very well photographed by sol polito and her big eyes glow the dvd print is excellent and a lot of extras are included including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film a terrible vitaphone short with the absurd toby wing and a funny cartoon about the cocoanut grove the radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor tyrone power in howard s role the dvd is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the warners gangster collection	positive
a b w film classic excellent story and performances from all the stars perhaps the acting style is a little dated a very god qulaity transfer to dvd except for one scene that is a little grainy i will watch this film again and again	positive
i turned the movie off was that supposed to be funny yes some kids toy \( that happens to be a small motorized electric model of a truck \) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village i mean was this taken from the original stephen king book then shame on you mr king that s overdoing the terror already so overdone not that the consept of trucks didn t appeal to me but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so called horrormaster so far believe it or not	negative
this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it unfortunately i was wrong the main problem of the film was characterization there were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character s actions one minute the small town girl played by heather graham is working at a nursing home then she s downing alcohol then she s jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason \( in fact she doesn t even seem drunk \) and all this entices the character colin firth to jump into bed with her i think the heather graham character is supposed to be quirky but because of the script and the way the film is cut she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance \( and this is no rebound relationship \) basically the movie continues along this vein with minnie driver showing up as the dark haired british ex fiance who you can t see ever having had a relationship with colin \( both actors are better in the much superior movie circle of friends \) in any case there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends additionally the setting is completely misused beginning with the sign that says more than 18 000 people live in hope in new england that does not classify as a small town they could have used the autumn setting and american ness of the people as restorative to the colin character the suggestion of that is there but it is never demonstrated instead they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the heather graham character downs a bottle of booze and colin firth s character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town s people although the hotel owners are fun if unrealistic the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character finally i don t neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie with the wierd cutting it may have seemed like a good idea at the time i think colin firth does his best at being an ambigious but still likeable guy heather graham aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all has absolutely nothing to work with so you can t even blame her for the horrendous character she has and everyone else including minnie driver is a complete caricature although minnie driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film i feel bad to judge this movie so harshly but it is unneccessarily bad and i had been hoping for something at least fun these actors all have much better movies out there	negative
the aids situation is far greater than we are told the corruption in africa is horrific the situation is beyond any horror film s scare anytime this film of lecarre s novel bears great importance to our future our destiny one of the most important films ever made actors like ralph fiennes rachel weitz need more commendation for it and director fernando merelles is a genius agripping thriller for the serious moviegover bravo 50 stars	positive
like her legendary mother nobody around today takes command of the stage like liza minnelli and this legendary event at new york s radio city music hall clearly illustrates this always a five star event in concert i have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and i am here to say that she has still got it and always will in recent years for some silly reason that i don t get the media has tried to damage liza s artistic credibility but it doesn t work when liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary superstar numerous standing ovations later it is clear that liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper bravo liza and keep on rocking	positive
i bought this dvd collection to use in a presentation i made for a graduate school class to complement a book review of murrow this collection is facinating for people who love murrow and those who ve never seen his work i will use this collection in future presentations that i ll make to my students as a professor every person in broadcasting should buy this collection and watch it to get a great look at the man who innovated our business	positive
i did not have any of the original trilogy on dvd i am happy to have the theatrical releases as i am not a fan of the se s particularly jedi i was nervous due to bad reviews but they look and sound great if you like star wars and want the original releases i highly recommend these if you already happily own the se s or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie then don t buy these	positive
english humor is famous for it s eccentricities but with the exception of selected monty python you need the english pedigree to really like it the young ones pick up where monty left off outrageous yet real there is a plot line but it doesn t get in the way it s a shame there weren t more episodes made	positive
yup definately the worst halloween movie come on michael on a reality show ha what the f k does that have to do with the series not only that but the plot is completely pointless the acting sucks and dr loomis and jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie not only that but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary and therefore comes off as pretentious don t get me wrong i love gore in movies horror or not but any knowledgable halloween fan knows that the halloween movies were always scary without the gore along with halloween 3 \( which actually had nothing to do with michael \) halloween resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series there are a many more problems with the movie than the ones i listed but i m tired of typing so i ll let other reviewers explain why it s so bad bottom line watch any halloween movie other than this or halloween 3	negative
no reviews for this video as the disk i have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of no disk is displayed as the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a dvd is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the dvd as i have to ship in from india so i can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk	negative
terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director didn t know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid	negative
great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost didn t finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira s voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	negative
i bought this for my 3yr old twins and from the first showing i kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons my girls already are familiar with some fairy tales so they really loved the three little pigs and the pied piper i highly recommend this dvd and think it is a great buy for parents with young children	positive
i m probably going to invest in a re order of this dvd collection because i simply have worn this one out from the they call it pro football opening to final gun of super bowl x this collection grips your attention and never lets go the writing is superb i especially like nfl 68 and the highlights well it was when pro football was pro football it was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships as was the case with the dallas cowboys of the late 60 s early 70 s next year s champions were the epitome of resiliency the championship chase was a pure joy to view if ever there was a peak in john facenda s narrative career with nfl films this was it though in the alternative i loved his voice overs in super bowls iii iv vii and ix ed and steve sabol really hit the bulleye with blair motion pictures i would have loved to see more afl highlights but that s just nit picking great job	positive
i wish i could give this movie zero stars it s really amazing how someone can inject raw gore violence and sick humour into a movie and try to pass it off as slick comedy drama and deep philosophy this movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie the sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism do yourself a favour and please don t ever watch this movie if it comes on air it s not even worth watching for morbid fascination i terribly resent the fact that i gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity but then i may actually be glad that i did at least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be	negative
this dvd is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes first scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record but the ghost of cab crag isn t too happy about having his record broken then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor and what s with the worm worshipers i mean they go like whoo a giant worm is our god whoo we hate cars then they go to the bocephus wrestling facility could they come up with a better name than bocephus there s a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister the last episode is by far the best a hockey ghost is terrorizing the world cup hockey event he s one of the toughest ghosts ever either that or the russian police are the biggest whimps ever i think this dvd is a good buy if you are a scooby fan just be prepared it can get a little goofy joey	positive
this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks	negative
aside from the insanely beautiful lead actress this is pretty run of the mill stuff not scary only sort of gross but i think it d be best in print clive barker deserved better than this	negative
it s an interesting approach at what people will do for money still i hated it john travolta was terrible as usual lisa kudrow who was the reason i watched this was so incredibly unlike her role on friends as she was a murderous goldigging nympho biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen i was very disappointed with her performance i can t believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a part the other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of bill pullman who was pretty funny as the i could give a damn about it cop the best thing about this movie though is the cute gullible waitress named wendy who s only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film anyway skip this one it was just plain awful	negative
wow that s the only thing i can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews i admit the very first time i watched the grudge with my father neither of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn t understand its success but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night i really began to see how frightening the movie is probably contains the same amount of fear as the original exorcist another movie that s really effectively well done you have to watch the exorcist and the grudge at night to get the proper effect the grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story i say pretty interesting because the storyline isn t the best or the easiest to understand just interesting enough to get the job done the grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little in fact this is probably its strongest point every time something scary happens you see just a little bit of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect which is very important if you want to effectively scare someone if the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn t have scared me nearly as much because i would have gotten used to seeing it the boy appears and then he s gone not giving away too much really works with this movie you see to really scare me you simply can t put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you have to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable the grudge works extremely well it this area the fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the grudge allows me to give the film another compliment i m telling you the scene with the woman inside that building by herself \( well except for a security guard \) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone chilling excitement i loved this scene i was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her the scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was awesome and the scene a few moments after this happened where she did see something in the shadow was another awesome display of bone chilling brilliance there s a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie freakin awesome excellent pacing and suspense makes the grudge a true horror classic in my opinion i ve seen a thousand horror movies in my time and i d easily put the grudge right up there as one of the best people today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the exorcist was the scariest movie of all time i wish everyone agreed that the grudge is a total classic and that the ring is another excellent one	positive
this is not a good movie bad acting story and picture i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not pass on this one unless u have 2 have it	negative
the first time i put this workout dvd on i expected to see exercises designed for abs buns and thighs what i actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing dvd i kept going thinking it would get to the abs buns and thighs but it never did the other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up or headshots only so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine you can t even learn it because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming picking up on a different beat to where it left off all in all an awful purchase and not even worth the 4 86 paid i turned it off halfway through the second workout and put billy blanks taebo on instead much better	negative
this video s only redeeming quality is its excellent pilates instruction like all stott videos this one takes extra care to explain proper form and technique unfortunately the aerobics portion is extremely boring and simple you just walk in place the whole time with no interesting variations if you are looking for a video for a beginner this one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are really out of shape although i consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercise this video was too easy for me i haven t exercised consistently in several years however i do have a moderately active lifestyle i walk and hike on occassion and i play with my kids at the park that sort of thing if you have trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape this would be a great place to start if you are somewhat fit this video might be too easy for you as well you might also like this video if you feel like you have no coordination there are no fancy moves at all if you can walk you can do this video i like simple steps but this was too simple in general though i think you d be better off saving your money and taking a walk spend your money on one of the other excellent stott videos that focuses exclusively on pilates	negative
in a movie such as this only james cameron could do it justice this documentary follows one of the most haunting disasters in the history of sea travel and for that reason everything had to be perfect and it was the special effects are unparalleled and the intricacy of the technological advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the movie this probably could have gotten the remaining 0 5 points \( going by the kab scale of course \) except i was really hoping that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the ship which i believe was supposed to be located a half mile away from the bow section the kab score 9 5	positive
damn there s nothing remarkable about the second item on this dvd it s your standard european made sexploitation film the wild wild world of jayne mansfield on the other hand is reprehensible it s a hodge podge of vacation footage of mansfield clips from her movie project and material entirely unrelated to mansfield linked only by the voiceover and then after an hour or so of light hearted softcore buffoonery the movie cuts to her death spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large mostly empty mansion she has left behind this movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after mansfield s death this is exploitation in its worst form i found the sudden change in tone the large volume of non mansfield material and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy or softcore porn to tittilate go elsewhere this one is not merely bad but evil	negative
season 3 of the l word is by far the best yet the character development and story have come so far since the 1st season and are even better than season 2 they have scaled back the sex a little bit but when they do put it in the sparks really fly i love the l word	positive
if i m not mistaken the only difference between the standard 50th anniversary edition and the ultimate collector s edition is 1 \) collectible robby the robot replica 2 \) forbidden planet and the invisible boy reproduction lobby cards portfolio 3 \) forbidden planet original theatrical poster mail in offer 4 \) metal alloy collector s case in that case the ultimate collector s edition at more than twice the price of the standard edition is a rip off the robby the robot replica is much smaller and much less detailed than the one depicted in the ad the mail in offer for the free poster requires a 3 50 shipping and handling fee the metal alloy collectors case is made of very thin metal and arrived dented not that it would take much to dent it save 21 00 and buy the standard version	negative
this movie has a good plot great acting and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life i did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos the profanity the undermining of parental authority and the lack of closure concerning landon s journey to faith it is evedent that this movie is directed to a less than mature audience i saw more bad in it than good which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie	negative
i purchased dick cavett s john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material i gained new insight about john and yoko so i bought cavett s interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar the 15 minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best	negative
from 1997 to 2003 joss whedon gave his audience some of the best episodes aired on television buffy the vampire slayer showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the unintimidating name of buffy summers who with the help of her high school friends and her stuffy mentor giles faced sundry monsters and saved the world a lot along the way she managed to leave an indelible impact on our pop cultural consciousness before its series debut buffy the vampire slayer based on its promotional push on tv seemed slated to be a straight out horror series starring an erstwhile typical high schooler who battles vampires and demons but fairly quickly on this unassuming little show thanks to whedon s intense and witty pop culture savvy yet very literate writing met and surpassed the viewer s expectations whedon created compelling stories and characters who grew on the viewers for seven years we watched them strive to maintain a normal life as they navigated thru high school college life and then to adulthood all the while frequently facing down supernatural threats which brings us to season 7 possible spoilers follow here in the bittersweet and melancholy finale season joss whedon attempts to provide closure to the show and also to bring it full circle to its origins the opening episode lessons has buffy escorting dawn for her inaugural school day back to good ol sunnydale high which has just been rebuilt on top of the old one this by the way means that the hellmouth is very much alive and again active somehow buffy is offered a job as a school counselor at sunnydale high by the enigmatic principal robin wood \( 24 s d b woodside \) back in england willow under the tutelage of giles and a benevolent coven of witches has been recovering from her turn to the dark side \( season six \) and receives a horrifying glimpse of the future for sunnydale meanwhile spike is found dwelling in the sunnydale high school basement in a bonkers state of mind influenced by his new soul and possibly also by something else lessee who s left anya is again a vengeance demon though her heart isn t really in it and xander is still fixing windows the season s major story arc involves the return of the first evil the original and the source of all evil the first s return is made possible by the instability caused by buffy s having died and consequently being resurrected \( again season 6 \) very early on we get a hint of the season s big bad as various sunnydale denizens spout the ominous warning from beneath you it devours this season also increases the scope of buffy s world even more as most of the watcher council are annihilated and giles is forced to seek out potential slayers \( who are also being killed off one by one by bringers no eyed murdering servants of caleb and the first \) and bring them to sunnydale for protection now more than ever buffy s leadership skills and methods are tested and even questioned as several of the potentials prove to be uncowed and contentious free thinkers buffy has never been forced to deliver as many bracing rallying speeches as she has been this season which attests to her foe s overwhelming level of menace because the first cannot enter our world in a corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people this is an opportunity for a callback of buffy s past uber foes for one last time we get to enjoy cameos of the master drusilla the mayor adam glory and two of the nerd trio pretty neat besides the first buffy faces two despicable and truly hard to kill villains who are themselves minions of the first the turok han an early caveman type of vampire \( thus even more sturdy than contemporary vampires \) and caleb the frightening mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats buffy senseless in several encounters as ever the writers do an amazing job the episodes are obviously action packed but underneath the surface the show is laden with metaphors and symbolisms themes of isolation the isolation of a leader female empowerment sacrifice friendship and humanity are touched on in great depth this season is also about the quest for redemption most of the members of buffy s scooby gang ironically at one point or another were evil or have turned evil in the past willow spike anya faith andrew all these characters are trying to find their way back to atonement it won t be easy this season has to be the one with the most recurring characters in it principal wood and the potentials are introduced season 7 also marks the return of andrew faith and in one episode angel with the glut of additional characters the core scoobies are given short thrift here although dawn does shine in potential and xander proves his worth in potential and dirty girls one episode selfless really focuses on anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold only spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the series the camera of course is ever on buffy summers the arrival of the potentials does usher in a freshness to the series as it simultaneously takes the spotlight away from the scoobies the take charge kennedy \( iyari limon \) the feisty rona \( indigo \) and amanda \( sarah hagan \) prove to be welcome additions to the cast while the non english speaking asian potential drops some instant funnies conversations with dead people reintroduces andrew \( the very good very funny tom lenk \) as a possible good guy while dirty girls marks the welcome return of sexy faith \( eliza dushku \) as her encounters with spike provide some of the high points of the season the awesome nathan fillion by the way is scary good as caleb the special features provide episode commentaries by various cast and crew members on lessons selfless conversations with dead

hero to come to her rescue seven years of quality television has proven that audiences will accept a tiny girl being capable of slaying monsters while remaining quintessentially feminine so above all else buffy the vampire slayer is meant to be a feminist allegory but for those who aren t into that there s still so much that this season has to offer an us against the world mentality superlative action sequences shivery horror fantasy elements witty repartees heartfelt dialogue gripping dramatic stories and great acting and of course great iconic heroes in buffy summers spike faith and crew

the special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period there s a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done doris and perry como s duet together was ok \( but perry seemed to not like doris flirting with him \) doris day has always been under rated as a singer her voice is sheer perfection it s too bad that doris didn t do more specials or have a variety comedy musical show like carol burnett	positive
this disc is pure gold featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80 s they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show they go through all their classics and then some whether it s stray cat strut gene and eddie or rumble in brighton what you see and hear on this disc is flawless must buy for all music fans not just fans of the cats	positive
i will be honest i like dolph lundgren a look at his filmography you see b movie classics such as the punisher universal soldier and blackjack dolph has been going trough a slump storm catcher and the startlingly routine jill the ripper and the awful minion \( aka fallen knight \) but with agent red dolph lundgren hits rock bottom agent red first of all steals it s music from predator 2 and it s plot from counter measures oh i m not finished yet it steals footage from storm catcher the scene where jon penner steals the air craft while posing as dolph lundgren now penner is 5 11 dolph lundgren is 6 5 for goodness sake yet they try to pass it off as dolph lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission this scene made me wanna throw up but i hung in there it turns out more footage is stolen i swear i saw footage from iron eagle and iron eagle ii i saw footage from crimson tide and i saw footage from counter measures what the heck was dolph thinking when he signed for this junk i have no idea when i was a teen \( when showdown in little tokyo came out \) i thought dolph lundgren couldn t sink lower then showdown in little tokyo then when i saw the minion i was almost sure dolph couldn t do worse well i pray he can t do any worse because agent red is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life this is coming from a guy who likes don the dragon wilson bottomline on agent red s cover it says once exposed you cannot survive take this as a warning	negative
i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents considering that it was aimed at children it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance while no stripping happened there wasn t much other difference in the style of dance later in the movie one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn t have her and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire regardless of the rest of the movie these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one	negative
harry potter and the chamber of secrets the second harry potter film in the series was the first bit of the harry potter phenomenon i was every exposed to i d kind of avoided the boy wizard before then but after seeing it those couple of years ago even though i didn t entirely follow what was what and who was who i realized it was pretty entertaining after reading the second book recently i picked up the dvd and watched it again the series gets a little darker like the books do but unlike the book i don t think the jump is as large which i reckon is a good thing though i prefer the first film it s still good to watch it s harry s \( daniel radcliffe s \) second year at hogwart s wizards school and after a shaky summer he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot it seems a certain heir of slytherin has opened the legendary chamber of secrets loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students literally many fingers point to harry harry s finger points to malfoy and ron s wand well that doesn t point at all as its broken and backfiring what s this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders haunted toilets a rogue quidditch bludger and a self flagellating house elf can harry ron and hermione figure things out all the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film plus the boys voices are breaking in some scenes they re kind of croaky sounding in other scenes they have their child voice and in others their voices broken through not neccesarily in that order there s a couple of new kids \( like colin creevey \) and they are just as well cast as the others the new adults are well cast too though not my favorite performance of his career shakespearean actor kenneth branagh makes an interesting gilderoy lockhart the vain second year dark arts teacher he played it a lot more subtley than i expected him to ex fast show comedian mark williams plays mr weasley which i reckon was a great choice i missed some of the cast from the last film though you hardly see warwick davis \( who plays professor flitwick \) let alone hear him say anything and john cleese s nearly headless nick who has a rather significant deathday party in the book has hardly anything to do here except get petrified there were other things cut out too like the catching of the garden gnomes at the weasley s the fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though personally i like to think of the harry potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion rather like the pictures in the world of hogwarts they give an idea of what the book would look like an impression special features include an interview with author j k rowling and script writer steve kloves as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors there s also slick virtual tours through diagon alley dumbledore s office and gilderoy lockhart s classroom \( a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is complete with gushing praises from the narrator \) there s also a couple of games you can visit the chamber of secrets after answering some harry potter trivia you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest \( which i found frustrating but addictive \) there s also a trivia game about what spell does what too unlike the first dvd you don t have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes you re able to go to them straight from the main menu just as well there s 19 of them and some of them are pretty significant notable scenes include harry s close encounter with the malfoys in the dark magic shop harry discovering that filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence i wish they d left some of these scenes in particularly the ones where harry potter questions his nature is he a good wizard or a bad wizard that was some mighty fine character development cut there there s also a gallery of design drawings and a section called colin creevey s darkroom where you can select pictures of various characters then play them in a slideshow of sorts apparently there s a whole stack of stuff in the dvd rom features but i just couldn t get them to work on my laptop s dvd drive using interactual player \( the player that many warner brothers films have you install to play their dvds \) it says there is a script error and when i tried windows media player 9 and cyberlink powerdvd 4 0 though it ran the dvd and everything else with it fine the dvd acted as if it wasn t in a dvd rom drive telling me that if i put the dvd into my pc s drive i d get all these wonderful features it was in my dvd drive aggh it is in a dvd drive maybe its just my type of laptop \( benq dh5100u 1 5 gigahertz \) ah well it looked like it would have been really fun especially for fans of the series all in all its definitely worth a look for harry potter fans but i would recommend you read the book first	positive
i take this title form the video store thinking in wynton marsalis when i was watching the dvd i can appreciate that the image is very good \( not great and i have a 720p tube tv \) and the sound is very good also \( not great i have a reference equipment \) but the show is so boring look you just desire this man stop to blow the drum s solo is just awesome but the rest of the show is to forgive about it	negative
actually i felt i was in love with this film as soon as i saw the very beginning the opening credits against the background of chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music candyman could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense but bernard rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant enchanting and spellbinding film out of it if you re interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won t find it here \( you will but not in quantities you used to \) candyman is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what s important where mood is what matters where you are given some food for thought i don t have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film i can only say it s a great achievement of bernard rose as a director besides i guess tony todd virginia madsen and xander berkeley had their best roles played in this feature i don t personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre but candyman is a true gem which wouldn t be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times by the way if you don t want to spoil your impression of the film better don t watch candyman parts 2 and 3 they are the average tenage urban legend flicks	positive
this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch even if it doesn t feel as audacious as i m sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby it is the epitome of all opposites attract love stories as a twenty year old depressive connects with a 79 year old life loving woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death as they keep showing up at the same funerals however the root of their respective interests couldn t be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive while the hearse driving harold simply likes the morbidity of it all the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship while his mother constantly attempts to make the death obsessed harold more socially acceptable first she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates to foil any hope of romance with these women however he stages mock suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee to try to convince harold to join the army the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins \( years before becoming a director in his own right with foul play and nine to five \) allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters actions the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self an archetype she played for years afterward while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide eyed cynicism it s really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold s eye rolling mother ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest cat stevens soundtrack hasn t aged as well as say simon and garfunkel s music in the graduate but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings unfortunately the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included	positive
i am not a horror movie fan in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me but this one indeed made me literally crap myself i caught this movie during the midnight hours on ifc 2 years ago and luckily the movie was just starting so i got to see it from beginning to end this movie is basically about a man named frank zito \( joe spinell \) who s a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women because he feels he s getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute after her death frank feels alone but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years frank lives in a tiny apartment in new york city in which he keeps several mannequins he uses these mannequins by putting his victim s bloody scalps on it s heads when he spots a woman named anna \( caroline munro \) a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her but kind of a romantic interest he takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts but will he change his mind about her and make her become another one of his victims some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut wrenching especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station and she hides in a bathroom stall i felt my heart pounding the whole entire time the effects were realistic \( nice job tom savini \) they don t come close to todays even though the movie was released in 1980 joe spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real and not only that but he physically looked the part too the scenes where he s in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes i have ever seen in a movie i believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there because we get to see the results of how an alone mistreated child might turn out this isn t one of those lame zombie movies it s the real deal if you like horror and a lot of gore and you haven t seen this then i recommend you watching this	positive
all the great reviews written previously say it all anne of green gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel i ve been watching this movie since i ve been a child and i still watch it as an adult a movie like this doesn t need special features for it to be attractive as a dvd \( although the commentary is great \) just the fact that no matter how long i keep this and how often i watch this movie it won t change like vhs does	positive
this dvd is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show for a best of volume i expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the dvd case advertises namely the best of and the scariest moments in my opinion this volume fails to deliver what it promises i am definitely a fan of the series and i know there are much better moments it has to offer about the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this dvd are some fairly decent examples of evp \( electronic voice phenomenon \) even though the dvd is fairly inexpensive i don t think it s worth the cost	negative
it embarrases me that i a music man have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie my wife rented it from a hasting s video store back when dvds were not widely distributed i was in awe of the movie as it ended because i had no clue what to expect and i wasn t expecting much anyway richard dreyfuss plays the role of glenn holland a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income \( he calls it a fall back position \) while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous his first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded but he finds his way into the students hearts the movie begins in the early 1960s and rock n roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape most of the students of course love the new music realizing he has an in with the students he makes an accurate comparison by playing bach s minuet in g \( for anna magdalena \) and asking the students what song it is they reply it is the lovers concerto by the toys \( what color is the rain that falls softly on my window \) he notes they are wrong and that it is actually the same song \( although he doesn t note that bach s is in 3 4 and the toys in 4 4 \) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the dorian scale he now has them right where he wants them along the way he continues to work on his masterpiece but life a new baby who turns out to be deaf and the need for new things put his life on hold as he notes by quoting john lennon life is what happens while you re making other plans \( or some facsimile thereof \) years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher he has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football he has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous yet he always comes back to the simple rock n roll to make his point about real music but reality plays hide and seek sometimes he has it out with his wife about their deaf son and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night john lennon is killed over time they become friends and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he hears the music but another reality awaits education budget cuts and here dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect the day they cut the football budget in this state well that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it it is in the presence of his now good friend jay thomas \( the football coach \) that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do the music track in this movie is awesome there s just one thing i m still trying to figure out how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it	positive
i was intrigued by satan s little helper due to several things namely its halloween theme which i m a big sucker for and the heralded return of jeff lieberman to the horror scene lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70 s and 80 s the last one being 1987 s remote control you would think that lieberman with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return well it almost feels like lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80 s due to how cheesy trashy cheap and godawful it is many myself included look upon the 80 s slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be the plot revolves around a 10 year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game satan s little helper it s now halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume which he wears proudly one afternoon he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house he becomes enamored with the tall mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper the two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy \( whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5 year old than a 10 year old \) inexplicably thinks it s all still a game of make believe if you think the plot sounds bad that s nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed nearly everything about it is god awful from the camcorder film quality to the laughable gore effects \( including the least ever convincing intestines i ve ever seen \) and especially the acting the 10 year old boy who appears in nearly every scene makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory the acting on just about everyone s part is bad and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason the flaky sister and the eccentric kooky mother there is not a single character we can give a darn about and we don t care the least bit when someone gets killed granted dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen but these ones truly take the cake i m a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews i m thinking some people are going to put this in the so good it s bad category but i m not having it some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be funny such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman an elderly lady and a stroller carrying a kid are downright appalling the villain himself is a bad joke as he doesn t utter a single word throughout the film instead delivering thumbs up signs to the kid and wagging his finger cheesy heck this film is cheesier than a black diamond factory satan s little helper comes across as the work of a first time wannabe horror amateur with no budget not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker to sum up how i feel about this film i will repeat a line that i see all over amazon that i usually feel redundant but somehow i find to be entirely fitting for this movie do not rent or buy this garbage	negative
the beautiful young brooke shields plays 11 12 year old violet daughter of hattie \( susan sarandon \) a new orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917 violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world when she turns 12 her virginity is auctioned off brooke shields portrayal of violet is poignant and beautiful her childish charms and innocence are so heart wrenchingly sweet the scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer s bed \( very childlike \) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose forehead etc and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings i just wanted to jump into the tv and give her a hug this mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene \( and others \) is particularly poignant as we know that young violet is merely reciting what she s heard from the prostitutes the photographer also says that violet doesn t know what she s saying you just want to turn the clock back hug violet and give her a proper childhood the photographer marries her because he s fascinated with her beauty innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute the part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he s trying to give back her childhood sadly she s been exposed to too much too soon in her life susan sarandon and brooke shields are wonderful in this movie as well as keith carradine the photographer the art aspect music soundtrack are amazing this movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as normal which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to rescue young violet	positive
shekhar kapur s vision of a e w mason s the four feathers is well done visually but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast paced and action packed plot while the basic story is kept many small details seem to have been needlessly changed for those who don t know the four feathers is supposedly about harry feversham a man enlisted in the army when harry is informed he will be sent to war in the sudan he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fianc ethne however life with ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues explaining to ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help harry in fact she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of ethne for the most part only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie for example the way that harry s friend jack durrance goes blind or the fact that harry disguised himself as a greek not as an arab the change that seems most prominent however is the fact that in the film jack durrance knows of harry s resignation from the beginning this subverts the whole quest that jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel in addition the entire battle between the warden of the house of stone of omdurman and harry and abou fatma was created solely for action value in the film however despite this addition of action the movie still seems to drag at points films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel that is why they are only based on them however as i ve said a lot of the changes made seem senseless i would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels if they have an hour or two to waste those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else	negative
i finally found out this was out on dvd after having the vhs version for many years the dvd edit is very close to the vhs version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act plus some video strobing added during cindy lauper s run down the runway which i m not sure was really needed but i m ok with it although the video strobing was done again later which seems to me as a cheap effect that really doesn t add to the performance i think brian adams and cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid i thought originally sinaed \( sp whatever \) was a strange choice at the time maybe good for the part but after seeing the documentary i see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end she s too instable and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event nor did she show any respect for the part speaking of which all of those artists that were called to perform at this event and didn t say yes on the first call shame on you if roger calls you for an event you say yes and put whatever you re doing aside because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with i wish there were more documentary material with this dvd as this was such a big event there should have been more information i had heard in an interview before the show that roger was once asked if he d ever do the wall again and he basically said if the berlin wall would ever come down then i would consider doing it again and this was never mentioned in the doc buy the video even if you have the vhs you ll enjoy it still waiting for pulse to be released as well enjoy	positive

orange county as a movie tries to play it safe the director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film i must say for around 50 of the film i was laughing jack black is truly my favourite character in the film colin hanks the lead actor is a boring sophisticated person he also plays black s brother in the film although jack black doesnt have a huge role in it everytime he s on the screen i seem to forget all the other characters around i thought the scene in which he jumps into the swimming pool with just his under shorts was funny but i defintely feel there are some seven other scenes featuring this master of crazy comedy i didnt find colin hanks \( in the film \) inspiration inspiring at all and think he should have gone to stanford for the simple reason i believe he didnt have much enough at orange county to wait for but then that s a story flaw or story strength \( however you perceive it \) come to think of it colin hanks character was extremely realistic polite and believable now all the credit in the world to the director for this however it was the drugged jack black who really tries to get him into something ive seen school of rock and i m sorry for i did not like it as much as i liked orange county it s the presence of jack black that does it for me i ve seen the film 4 times which is probably why i can t stand hanks and his goodness anyhow forget all that watch the film rent it steal it buy it download it just give it a watch cheers	positive
after watching harsh times we wondered is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life we couldn t believe what we were watching it was meant to be the new 2006 version of training day they even got christian bale to play the lead role but only in the eyes of the people involved in it it was a miscalculation and we ll explain why brief story the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of l a jim davis \( christian bale \) is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran now in the states he is looking for a job as a cop jim s best friend mike alonzo \( freddy rodr guez \) is also unemployed but when his friend comes to visit they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities selling drugs guns getting high just to name few to spend time with his friend mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia \( eva longoria \) making her believe that he is looking for a job she doesn t know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face review harsh times has many problems but the most notorious one is the crime video game feeling it has throughout the film the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a grand theft auto or scarface the world is yours video game adaptation with a little bit of cheech chong in the mix there is no climax we just see them driving to different places arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end christian bale s accent in this movie doesn t help either not only it changes through out the film but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager like also there is no chemistry between them the acting in this movie is disappointing especially from bale who we liked in movies like american psycho batman returns and the prestige it is clear that he was miscast this time he just cannot do what denzel washington did in training day because of his accent and terrible acting in this film we believe this is his worst performance to date this is something he doesn t want to add to his resume the verdict christian bale returns but this new american psycho cannot find his equilibrium harsh times tries too hard to create the edgy dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that training day had but it doesn t even come close to achieve that goal we laugh at the silliness of the story overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent	negative
above the rim is an entertaining street drama that focuses around kyle lee watson an inner city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him he won t listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game as he thinks that he is the best player ever he s been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout s attention but he does catch birdie s eyes when he plays birdie is a well known gang leader who offers kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a shoot out basketball contest that means the world to him kyle being impatient as ever agrees to join not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him a high school security guard with a past knows the danger that birdie presents and he is the only who has a chance to get through to kyle before it is too late not only is this a very good basketball movie but it is also an intense and character driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life and how we have to live with them in the long run the film has some great performances from duane martin marlon wayans and the late tupac shakur even though everybody is great in their roles the showstopper is indeed shakur he gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over my only complaint is the length of the movie it s true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half isn t short but i think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie i think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story still it is a really good movie that didn t disappoint me the dvd doesn t have a whole lot to offer you can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen depending on your preference the movie looks and sounds very good the only special features that are offered are movie trailers and those aren t even that great i would ve loved it if they included the music video regulate by warren g and nate dogg in fact given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie they could ve included a couple of music videos it s not a great dvd but at least it s not that expensive i really enjoyed above the rim it may not be flawless but it definitely does more right than wrong the characters are what really dominate the movie even if you re not a fan of the game it s still something to check out if you re a fan of character drama exciting intense conflict driven and full of heart above the rim is a very well done film michael cran	positive
i rented this \( sigh \) several years ago liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but didn t open the new copy until the other day and watched it today i regretted buying a new copy after all remembering it only as a few heartwarming \( i didn t want my heart warmed \) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct \( incidentally the 3 girls are not sisters just 2 of them \) i made fun of it my friend made fun of it i watched a few minutes then turned it off then watched some more finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it it has charm it is a soap opera but i thought it was well acted and well done it had humor happiness sadness embarrassment \( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid s car \) love it had so much plot that it practically had none at all and i liked it but now 15 minutes later i m beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all no range no depth somehow he could carry a tune but that s about the size of it speaking of size the size of his ego \( which i assume is why he didn t deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics \) would have made a mushroom cloud i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing for it s kind i thought it was perfectly done i just like them a smidge more sophisticated the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious	positive
daniel day lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world he looks like a different person in almost every film he makes i assume that s the real day lewis in this flick about the rebellion in northern ireland revenge and absolution his romantic interest emily watson puts in a good performance too day lewis looks a lot different than he did in gangs of new york the unbearable lightness of being my left foot and last of the mohicans but he is just as compelling in his performance i thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat hollywood finale but otherwise i enjoyed it if you like substantial filmmaking good acting great drama unfamiliar vistas and a good story you ll enjoy it too	positive

the firms super body sculpt is a 40 mins 3 parts workout which is broken up into upper body lower body and abs each segment has its own warmup and cool down it can be performed one segment at a time or all together for a complete total body workout the upper body flies by quickly with pushups lat rows and french presses and biceps the lower body section focuses a little too much on squats and by the end of your last leg press exercise there are more squats that will make you want to scream enough i found the abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches and too much on obliques the stablization exercises are a great bonus to this dvd and are my favourite overall it is very well instructed you can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough especcially during leg presses and squats i usually do all three segments to get the full benefits i need and this dvd is great as a beginners tool to a firm body	positive

when once and again first began i dismissed it as a show for just women but after watching just one episode i found myself hooked this was unlike any show i had seen before i actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families once and again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love it goes much deeper than that once and again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well but then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well with the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between lily \( sela ward \) and rick \( billy campbell \) and how their ex s still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children once and again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today even thought it s time on television was short once and again showcased the acting talents of sela ward and billy campbell and launched the careers of shane west and evan rachel wood i am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on dvd and that they have finally decided to release seasons 2 and 3	positive
four stars seem a little generous the film is certainly memorable and certainly different there are a lot of odd things going on here the oddest is why the central character mark lewis is so obviously a blond blue eyed german very strange this is there some weird subterranean comment about the sickness of hitler s germany and how we ought to feel sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes because of their blighted childhoods much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy handed however as other reviewers have pointed out it is consistently perverse the director of the film within the film the walls are closing in is played by an actor who was in point of fact virtually blind he had a bit part in several james bond films is there some message here peeping tom s father the heartless psychologist was played by powell himself what is this telling us is part of the message meant to be that the camera kills it doesn t hang together somehow what s the meaning of the model with half a hideous face why is the would be girl friend s alcoholic mother blind why is the only presence with real star quality moira shearer playing a stand in much of the premise of the film seems promising but it is clumsily written and directed with a leaden hand in fact what many of the powell pressburger films seem to lack is any real sense of pace or excitement it s all a bit tired and slow there is nausea but no shock or thrill loco perhaps but psycho it isn t	positive
seriously i am an expert and this movie sucks but imagine for a moment yes stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound strikingly engaging and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals those experts whose tastes likes and dislikes decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all besides this interesting question which is put forth explicitly without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry and in about 60 seconds the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs	negative
the movie had potential good cast and interesting plot its the kind of movie you want to like but just can t i did not find it all that funny or romanic it seemed that the mother and a bride s maid were suppose to be funny characters but i found neither very amusing i have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie their relationship is not developed well at all as another reviewer noticed there is a bit of pretty woman here as dermot plays a male escort for whatever reason julia roberts as a hooker is cute whereas dermot is not i found is pretty disgusting that messing falls for a male prostitute there is a lot of crude sexual humor that i didn t care for my favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the english countryside which is really beautiful its not a terrible movie but i would be upset if i paid 10 to see it in the theater	negative

the quiller memorandum takes place back during the cold war it represented a time and place in history that was true at that time it accurately depicts an era that is now gone that some of us lived through the movie by today s standards is a little disjointed and incomplete it jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60 s or 70 s in order to get a g or gp rating as a result of those incomplete or cut scenes part of the movie makes no sense the movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author s original book the most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score including matt monroe s wednesday s child i was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later perhaps wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again quiller must have gotten lost on his way home	negative
i have very fond memories of this short lived irwin allen classic the picture and sound on the dvd s is better than i remember the video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono i give volume one of the time tunnel five stars for pure television enjoyment volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show the unaired extended version of the pilot irwin allen s behind the scenes home movies visual effects camera test still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots once again it is lacking in cast interviews many of the actors from this show are still alive so why didn t the studio interview them for the dvd set it would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought s on the show my only gripe is that this show only ran for one season so why split it into two volumes surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price	positive
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i m a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	negative
attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini series of its day it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome gerard butler is attila the hun and he is everything about attila in this role never was an actor better suited his character is sharp passionate determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes	positive

i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens book with my wife here are my gut impressions first very little is true to the book that s not really a gut impression that s the impression i got hearing my wife say that s not in the book that s not in the book actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling it makes for beautiful stills and pictures and those made me want to see the movie i expected a heart warming christmas story and what i got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out of control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why i m watching you get to see a kid chasing a ticket through a train a kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train a ticket making its way through the forest rube goldberg style back to the train \( forty minutes into this movie and one girl s train ticket is the star of the show \) ok the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have a train sliding out of control on the ice a train trying to outrun cracks on the ice a train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster \( fans of the coaster tycoon series of computer games will feel right at home \) until finally it arrives at the north pole then the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have a train car running out of control through santa s village kids getting lost in the christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory and then kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to santa s sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf ho ho ho at least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so i can help these kids out it s like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion you know it s awful but you can t look away and you d better think twice before letting any very young children see this it could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up my wife and i were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons and we were very glad that we didn t so what could have been a classic enduring and endearing compliment to a classic childrens christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn t advance the story or develop the characters one bit whatever a character driven story is this is the opposite never have i seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little i d rather set up my old american flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while i read the book to my kids	negative

first off robert deniro as the monster i saw him and immediately thought of jake lamotta or vito corleone they didn t even try to disguise his accent and no one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from new york second kenneth brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story finally the scene where elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous frankenstien s shock that she s not happy to be back burnt up cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest was supposed to be touching but i laughed we all know how great kenneth brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really really really bad i give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of aidan quinn s face	negative
to say this film is self indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement almost every joke in this movie that didn t center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of smiths other movies maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that but if you have only made 4 other films \( very poor ones too by cinematic standards \) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego the film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid although the humor really dosen t reach even that level here is a recap of the types of humor in this film making fun of fans fart jokes scatological jokes profanity \( yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself \) making fun of miramax making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film \( i swear i am not making this up \) and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew this movie comes across as crass tasteless profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects thank god i borrowed this movie and didn t pay anything to rent it i won t be watching another kevin smith movie anytime soon	negative
i just got my copy of the dvd r rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me since this scene is most appealing in the way the original version first displayed it in 85 to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely i was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie if anyone saw the unrated 1985 vhs version you would know what i mean lana was the movie why remove it i have not a clue unsatisfied customer	negative
the scene where eric idle whines oh you re no fun anymore is a deceptive one if anything these guys are even more fun than before the second half of monty python s flying circus s first season is even more polished and mad than the first continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity in these episodes we have a serial killer barber lecherous art critics an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral tunnel to java and jump the english channel ken shabby every girl s dad s nightmare thuggish old ladies bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla camel spotting and prime ministers falling through the earth s crust the longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into scotsmen and streaming north of the border soon scotland will be choked with scotsmen and england is pretty much abandoned the culprits tennis playing human devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of andromeda and of course the stuff that has become comedy legend the scene where john cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store \( it s a stiff bereft of life it rests in peace \) and the lumberjack song \( i cut down trees i skip and jump i like to press wild flowers i put on women s clothing and hang around in bars \) of course no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these dozens of skits these five brits \( and one american who did the little cartoons \) created some of the most unabashed naughty nasty and just plain weird comedy ever which still influences everything from saturday night live to author jasper fforde and all of this by men who often dress up as the world s most unattractive girls with only a tiny budget and minimal cast the 70s production values are omnipresent and they are decidedly unpolitically correct but in a weird way these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise the writing and acting are pure raw unrefined comedy probably the most memorable actors here are cleese and idle cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice and eric idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber while michael palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane by this point the monty python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance in other words it s funny and should be watched	positive
equilibrium is a curate s egg its best parts are not good throughout and its worst aspects make erratic appearances the acting is really the least of its problems the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up equilibrium however poorly aspires to be a dystopian film and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike such a formula was employed magnificently in michael radford s adaptation of george orwell s 1984 contrarily films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by alfonso cuaron s junky adaptation of p d james the children of men there are essentially three parts to this formula first there must be a depiction of a believable society and plausible justifications for its existence the author or script writer must paint vividly yet remain nuanced since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it second two thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist which formally unveils the ethical dilemma here the protagonist offers his alternative usually an acknowledgement of the humane third the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist s choice he must surrender to the system rebel against it or be conquered by it the ending if it is not tragic in the classical sense must be ambiguous if it is ended happily it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers thoughts the problem has been resolved and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it libria the society depicted in equilibrium is a post apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings and the actions carried out on their behalf represent the fons et origio of man s inhumanity to man the objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace is this believable ultimately it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved however a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war and aversion is something we principally feel a more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent the protagonist \( john preston a member of the grammaton cleric an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so called sense crimes \) marries begets children hesitates in killing his partner what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling and if we are being generous and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say you can never entirely eliminate feeling it fails still because if the denizens of libria weren t completely devoid of feeling they couldn t be as cowed as they are depicted instead countless times throughout the film characters make comments statements enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion to have had characters who were truly apathetic or for whom the fictitious drug prozium was effective they would have had more in common with star trek s borg the backdrop for this dystopia then lacks subtlety or nuance from the first fifteen seconds of film the viewer ethically objects it remains tediously manichean throughout the viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen in brave new world it is mustapha mond s conversation with john the savage in 1984 it is o brien s talk with winston smith in the children of men it is a debate between theo and the xan in equilibrium the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the matrix three years before here was the moment for the talky bit of the film the sophisticated counter punch the moral awakening the vindication of the human instead the viewer is given another low brow hollywood denouement john preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo there is no bit of dialogue with father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that feelings are essential to thought or that peace has been obtained at a terrible price all the loose ends littered liberally throughout the film are never addressed why have art in libria why does father intonate and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a leni riefenstahl propaganda film a better film would have acknowledged these scenes and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between john preston and father \( or dupont as it turns out \) the conclusion of equilibrium can be summarized as follows good guy kills bad guys sixty second revolution ensues people can feel again hero smiles time to go to bed there wasn t ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway what was wrong was obviously wrong and what was right was intuitively right the viewer never believed the reasons libria came to be or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found huxley s orwell s james zamyatin s or koestler s explanations in equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal unoriginal action movie to follow the plot then was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft core porn films they needn t be sensical because no one is interested in the story but rather for the titillation arousal and amusement many viewers of equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences \( a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest \) but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment during the film a woman asks preston why are you alive preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer i m alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society to serve libria it s circular you exist to continue your existence what s the point she asks and what s the point is exactly the point about this film	negative

i was expecting to see a decent film by bava but after having seen about 5 of his films i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story this film is just like all the rest there is no point to any of it there is no plot and hardly any suspense suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult its quite tedious chris lee is rather banal also he doesn t do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio most of the cast is rather dull also supposedly playing some ancient noble family they look more like 1960 s mop heads and morons who were on too much acid the dialogue what there is is crude probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says i can t have more ice cream so i would suggest renting planet of the vampires because that is more enjoyable than this waste interesting character to note was lesmo dubbed as the european peter lorre who doesn t have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget	negative
me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever perhaps i m biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting	negative

for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the next riverdance the dancers are all talented if self consciously hip and in great shape but the numbers that focus more on t a than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me i love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms but ballroom dance is ott enough \( if you ve ever watched a competition \) and doesn t need to be tarted up beyond recognition the way it is here add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess	negative
the american dream is an appealing myth no doubt the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great the problem as george carlin put it is that you have to be asleep to believe in it so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs and that is where belly comes in an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it this urban drama stars dmx \( perpetually rapping \) nas and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot one couple tries to escape to africa but find it easier said than done and tommy \( dmx \) is sent on a mission to kill a minister but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn t even exist come on now i ve known drug dealers in my day and they didn t live in large gaudy mansions rap stars do rather they live in shacks or their parent s basement if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is the directing by hype williams isn t that bad he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks the lighting never seems quite right but i m gonna let that one slide as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used the n and f words are used to comedic proportions their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason and then on top of it all we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us sorry man but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn t make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks you re still a businessman this film is not worth watching any social point that is made is made accidentally and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta 1 4	negative
terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger it covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma they have their differences yet the love between them is always so obvious it s also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other even their sex lives i ve seen this movie several times and everytime i cry at the end in spite of the death the movie ends on a positive note giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor \( also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson \) creates a plot within a plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her when she has been cheating on him as well somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover \( played by the very talented john lithgow \) we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn t seem wrong if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut wrenching at the same time this is a perfect choice	positive

when was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie you actually paid your own money to see it last night pasedena the bicycle thief it s an art movie it doesn t count we re talking about movie movies robert altman is one of my favorite directors mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases this short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context with this dialog the player reveals exactly why hollywood movies don t make the money they should not because they don t make quality films but because when a good movie does make money it doesn t count because it s not a movie movie if he stopped to really listen to what was being said he would ve seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don t cost much to make but people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering wait there s more the people in the room don t know it but producer griffin mill in a fit of paranoia killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night he was being stalked by a writer but he blamed \( and murdered \) the wrong one now he s still being stalked still in danger of losing his job and the cops suspect him of murder not a good week for mister mill as the conversation presses on mill s potential replacement passes around a newspaper telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts mill spots the story on his murder which we re already watching play out in a movie yes it s that type of movie the self referential hollywood movie about hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers enjoyment we ve seen it about a thousand times before \( or since \) get shorty adaptation wes craven s new nightmare even certain elements of 8 1 2 there s really nothing too special about it but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable pay close attention to the ending scene and think about what words they re using opposed to what they re really saying there s really only one word for a film like this clever	positive

this is one of the best \( if not the best \) pure screwball comedies of the 1930 s next to the original thin man movie libeled lady is my favorite powell loy effort this time the magic chemistry of that oft paired duo is enhanced by the box office drawing talents of fellow mega stars spencer tracy and jean harlow the first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four top drawer actors merrily confidently stride arm in arm toward the camera the plot is convoluted the star has erroneously printed a story about heiress connie allenbury \( myrna loy \) portraying her as a marriage wrecker connie immediately files a 5 million dollar libel suit star newspaper editor warren haggerty \( spencer tracy \) counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman bill chandler \( william powell \) to romance connie and place her in a compromising position thus negating the lawsuit haggerty convinces his harried long suffering fiancee gladys benton \( jean harlow \) to instead marry the bachelor chandler as part of the scheme things get really tricky when gladys falls for chandler and chandler falls for connie who eventually falls for chandler and haggerty he pretty much spends the movie just seething yet everything ends fairly well even if there s still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom libeled lady boasts mix ups and complications galore and couples matching cross matching and mismatching sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy delicious acting is laid in by four stars who throughout their film careers never ever lost their prime powell proves again his mastery of the confused double take and along with the wry understated myrna loy dominates the refined repartees and representing the more lowbrow couple tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and harlow the affronted looks walter connolly as connie s angling loving father is simply wonderful the intricate storyline is easy to follow thanks to the clear helmsmanship of jack conway with this cinematic venture hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars i think it s brilliant stuff	positive
having an m a in english literature as well as a b a in literature and history anytime a movie is both historical and literary well i get a bit excited to say the least i don t wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it s not but the writers directors producers set it against a historical backdrop nonetheless on that note this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott with that being said i enjoyed tristan and isolde almost as much as gladiator and a bit more than kingdom of heaven \( all of these by the way are ridley scott films \) notice the historical adaptations here while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare s romeo and juliet as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend this movie is not exclusively for the high browed college types no sir good ol red blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie this is by no means a chick flick since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense on the other hand it s not the typical hack and slash macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story in short it should please both sexes simultaneously aside from james franco \( tristan \) i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast sophia myles \( isolde \) is for the most part a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king \( who just so happens to be isolde s father \) in short this is one of the best movies i ve seen in awhile on some levels it reminds me of king arthur just as king arthur attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur guinevere and lancelot so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england if you ll recall in king arthur arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal but oh well it made for a good story here we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea what the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around well tristan and isolde holds true to history in this aspect namely that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo saxons this would of course have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall and this is exactly where the movie is set let s not forget the story of saint patrick remember he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity it s interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new fangled religion in ireland so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand i particulary liked king arthur and kingdom of heaven despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics critically speaking tristan and isolde has been a bit of a mixed bag as well but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics rent it first if you must but i suspect this one will be a keeper in your dvd library	positive
i viewed this dvd and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars this is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it s kind of lame it shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers i still have not made the connection as to why ron jeremy has anything to do with this documentary ladies if you are expecting to see skin this dvd shows very little others may have a limmited interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the us	negative
this is the french x rated version of 99 women directed by jess franco the running time of this feature is 98 minutes which means that this is probably the longest least censored version of the film that is available the story involves a women s island prison a sadistic female warden a lustful male governor and the young lovely female inmates can you see where this is heading there are scenes of extreme sexuality \( especially when you consider the film was released in 1969 \) which include \( \) my big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film in a few cases they don t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling \( standing in \) for just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying i guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969 but looking at the dumb story lousy editing and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective this is just a dated curio	negative
this is a showcase of jet li s brand of martial arts fast and furious while this is no fist of legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going what i did nt anticipate was the humor absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it s own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying	positive
clearly this movie was never intended as high art or even a zombie gore fest although hyped as such so it s probably a bit unfair and easy to take shots at it however i think it fails on it own terms many spoilers to follow stop here if you plan to view the entire film the premise a group of stupid eco terrorists raid a research facility in london even though warned by a researcher release some highly agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a fast acting \( within seconds \) virus that transforms them into insane red eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches one drop of their saliva or blood can infect you the plague is let lose the hero cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed it s 28 days later and he wakes up but no one s there he then wanders around an empty london in hospital scrubs looking confused yelling hello hello there are no bodies outside and nothing that looks like the remains of one there are almost 15 million people in metropolitan london where did they go i asked myself the supporting cast he then wanders into a church and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people he yells hello at which time some start screaming and rush at him in the close up it s clear they have turned and he slugs the creature priest thing with his bag of coke cans he gets out more stuff happens eventually he meets smart and tough selena \( naomie harris \) armed with a matchete and mark \( noah huntley \) armed with a steel bar who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted hero who turns out to be a bicycle messager boy who lives with mum and dad seems the creatures come out mostly at night mostly hero insists on going home mark selena tag along we find his very middle class mum dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of booze and pills guess they could not live in a world without telly more talk and moaning and tears from hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some nasties more fighting bad guys are killed by selena and mark while hero cowers on floor mark gets infected denies it but is chopped by selena who can see it in his eyes damm girl if i m ever in a zombie movie i want you along day 2 comes the pair then wander aimlessly though london chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and at this point i start thinking wouldn t it be a good idea to get some guns preferably full auto with a lot of ammo i mean although the creatures are fast they are stupid don t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead police stations and military bases are all over london probably deserted and filled with guns but this doesn t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a baseball bat machette which you must get close to use emmmm i start squirming a bit in the seat and for the first time look at my watch but it s still kind of ok so far it s still a tight well made interesting film with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line and mostly believeable in it s own low buget post apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest maybe there a reason the hero is cast as stupid or will he grow and learn through experience maybe but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the film and it s getting real hard to identify with him or care the suporting cast 2 night falls our pair see flashing lights on the top of a high rise much action ensues they find more survivors just a average working type dad taxi driver and his young daughter more talk seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go north where the army \( who usually have guns \) has set up a secure area works for me after some debate on whether it better to stay where they are isolated in fact trapped on top of a building with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by zombies or travel north to safety in daylight and safety \( remember the monsters don t operate in daylight \) this group of dopes reluctantaly decide to go north in a taxi with no guns \( remember rule 3 of zombie films gun are good \) and at this point in time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity the journey of the dumb piling into dad s hack loaded with junk as if going on a brighton holiday with all even tough selena giggling and laughing off they go when faced with the choice of driving through a dark tunnel where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed or another safer route they naturally chose the tunnel stuff happens stopping to get gas the hero wanders alone into a dark confined space for no real reason armed only with a baseball bat more stuff happens stopping for the night they decide that a picturesque open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to you guessed it start a really big fire and go to sleep with no one on guard i m not making this up folks nothing happens however they do get to see a family of white and black horses running free and it s clear that we are no longer watching a horror action film with some internal logic but a trite message film they reach the army blockade but no one is there in spite of dead everywhere they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see more stuff happens after this the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point at the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic army major \( aren t they all though \) that the goon s can t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it think about that one we also learn that the virus is contact borne not airborne think hard about that one dudes since it started in one local it s very unlikly to have spread thoughout england in 28 days big plot holes dumb ending 110 pound stupid hero becomes arnold the terminator in 10 mintues girls decide it s far better to die a gruesom death then put out and lose their honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in cammos who are their only protection really dumb stuff after an excellent start sad this was a really superior film for the first 20 mintues	negative
let me preface this review by stating that if i had to do this 90 minute workout in its entirety i d probably never reach for it it s just too long but in its dvd format karen voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable it s set up so that you can follow it in logical sections and best of all you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the amazingly thorough floor workout which is terrific for those like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from performing squats and lunges i am able to successfully break this whole program down into warmup arms abs cooldown stretch mondays and thursdays and warmup floor legs cooldown stretch on tuesdays and fridays and each intense workout is about 45 minutes music and clothing especially the men s outfits are dated but i can get over it \( though i m sure there are others who cannot \) broken into shorter segments i rate this 4 5 stars which i round up to 5	positive
let me start by saying that i love this movie and love fulci this was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it \( let me explain \) this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me when i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from city i was shocked when i watched the nipple scene in ripper i was shocked watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest \( im sorry \) the only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned which honestly i enjoyed more zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest \( isnt that why we watch fulci flicks	positive

the door in the floor is difficult to like even \( or perhaps especially \) if you re a fan of john irving s book a widow for one year which was the source of this film the movie is dark depressing slow moving it also showcases the least likable characters from the book to make matters worse it focuses only on the first third of the novel s story which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated \( alienating \) couple s suffering the film is completely devoid of the novel s interesting more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family s life into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who aren t well developed in the film but who are central to the book s satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story this may give you an idea why the film wasn t very successful with audiences the theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people unfortunately the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents played by jeff bridges kim basinger in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons it wallows in the empty chasm that s grown between them delves into the sad meaningless even cruel love affairs they each engage in in vain attempts to ease their sorrows escape the pain of the love lost between them of course the greatest loss the loss of their sons the film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose and finally we witness the pain of their very young daughter who was born out of yet more of the parent s attempts to fill their empty sad lives and we re treated to a view of her pitiful childhood growing up with parents who truly aren t there the greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel and even worse why they chose to bring to life only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it if the theme of loss is one you re very interested in you might find this movie quite affecting as for me a great fan of the book i can only hope that someday someone makes a better more complete adaptation of this great book it s not nearly as desperate sad a story as this film version on subsequent viewings i ve grown to appreciate this film a bit more taken completely apart from the novel it s not a bad film undoubtedly the performances are wonderful however little fun they are to watch	negative

two of the worst stories in the history of tos but for different reasons the way to eden makes the mistake of trying to be trendy and so dates badly what the real problem is though is that it makes the enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment especially of all people captain kirk requiem for methuselah is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of da vinci brahms and others what it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for kirk s relationships with women threre is no way any woman would have kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her he is far to full of his own importance for that this effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode a real pity	negative
let s face it tinseltown has run out of original story lines that s usually when they turn to remakes i ve seen several remakes over the years both tv and movie but this is one of the best remakes i ve seen in quite some time i really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line what a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the tv show and pulled all of it s story from the comic book if you were never into comics to begin with then you can t appreciate the story line another thing that i feel is under appreciated about this movie is the cgi people have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time the amount of man hours that went in to creating the cgi is something to be applauded and appreciated not mocked and thrown out with the trash you have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it the story of the hulk is a sad depressing dramatic story there isn t anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something the hulk wasn t meant to be campy it was meant to be serious my only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play banner s love interest the little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted	positive

therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages 13 14 15 16 and 17 cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run of the mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick \( of course \) but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines \( such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation \) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future	negative

i watched this film yesterday at a library and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding during the first minute they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising during the next 99 minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence using acted scenes fake blood and sound bytes from scholars to give a play by play summary of the carnage and beheadings leading up to a mention of napoleon during the last thirty seconds they surprisingly conclude by saying that the french revolution was a very good thing because it inspired china and vietnam and because louis was a tyrant prior to this little or no mention had been made of louis tyranny although the film had dwelt on his bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times after watching 90 minutes of bloody scenes i found the films conclusion that the french revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur i would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion	negative

house of mirth is one of the most depressing movies i ve ever seen to be clear i ve seen movies like oh say schindler s list or the heart is a lonely hunter that treat tragic events either in the macrocosm or the microcosm that did not leave me depressed rather they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think house of mirth deals with tragic themes including human society s ability to destroy its own and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites it wasn t though moving or thought provoking i wasn t moved by gillian anderson s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor i didn t believe gillain anderson s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor rather i was bored i kept wanting the film to go faster it s a great irony edith wharton s novels are real page turners quick to the point hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality house of mirth has gorgeous clothing and sets i didn t care about anybody onscreen though i didn t believe anybody onscreen i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces as if to prove these points people are hypocrites see people are insincere see if a person has any decency at all that person is destroyed see i would tend to agree with all of the above points so why do i need to watch this movie also as a woman who as lily bart was meant to has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that i felt that this movie no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally betrayed lily bart lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film she all but participates in her own destruction you want just once for her to show some initiative some intelligence some ability to create her own fate the film denies her those abilities in this crippling of lily bart the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does movies like gone with the wind that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning and occasionally gaining some power imo are much easier to watch one might argue that such films are not realisitic i don t know even we real life lily barts have our resources and our triumphs and again watching lily bart in house of mirth slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine	negative

having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film do not watch this film it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person do not watch this film	negative
they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome then all of the sudden the paid wwe guys just began to bad mouth the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young and i really can t distinguish one s ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use which drugs presumably they re talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let s not talk about that let s just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him i don t he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk and oh yeah they don t even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from imdb com that he was asked to appear but declined why don t they address this this docu is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking	negative

this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it s really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you ll miss him	negative

i have owned a copy of this film for a long time i have probably watched it ten times and i always tear up a little at each viewing from the beginning newsreel of a shell shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone to the final reel of harvey milk s prophetic and haunting statements the viewer is mesmerized though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor his election in the 1970 s that of an open and unrepentant gay man made national headlines he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere who at that time were unrepresented and for the most part still forced into the closet this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time milk was a very eloquent speaker and his sensibility logic and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs a buffoon like character who not only was a terrible speaker who couldn t even clearly express his arguably irrational fears but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk the public view at that time was about family values with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways \( old times come round again \) milk s voice opposed this view openly and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented the notion of this martyrdom and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk has been argued nevertheless his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message nor the admiration he deserves this film unfolds as it happened seeming like fiction but all too real as milk is assassinated along with the mayor by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white whose subsequent trial with the famous twinkie defense and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation if only the mayor had been killed white would have gotten life but the fact that milk a gay man had also been killed leaned public sympathy towards white an absurd but all too realistic conclusion there are many moving telling historically signifigant moments in this film but none so clearly represents those times and milk s loss and legacy as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders seas of people holding candles and standing silently came together in a very moving moment in time this film which won best documentary at that years oscars transcends its subject matter and is simply a great documentary gay rights have made much progress and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all excluding those who were there are old enough to remember or are gay nonetheless harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement and his legacy through schools named after him organizations and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless lives on	positive

this was a subject of much conversation when i was deployed to saudi arabia and it s still a favorite with most military and civilians in iraq ground hog day is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same until finally the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it s the day you leave the movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique bill murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well it s fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here	positive
until sam raimi made spider man i think we all regarded tim burton s batman as the best superhero movie \( even though i actually don t consider batman to be a superhero because he has no superpowers \) burton directed this movie and did a great job this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then michael keaton is batman bruce wayne needless to say batman is wayne s alter ego keaton is magnificent at playing the character s alter ego keaton also does a good job playing the character when he s not in costume keaton s bruce wayne isn t as gloomy as christian bale s was in batman begins which isn t necessarily a bad thing but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies but overall bale s bruce wayne is superior to keaton s because bale has a much more developed character to play however keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale the problem with this movie is that the joker \( jack nicholson \) steals the show the whole movie revolves around him so this isn t batman s movie this movie should have been called the joker so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton now you know the thing is the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality and they barely scratch the surface of the character s background we know practically nothing about wayne you d think the guy that s batman wouldn t be so uninteresting but we re bored to tears everytime wayne s onscreen \( and out of costume \) but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes he plays an even more menacing batman than bale so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton but keaton didn t have anything to work with so it s not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak but one of the strengths of keaton s performance is that if you ever met wayne he d seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman that s something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish but thankfully bale was able to do it michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred it s hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years i assumed michael caine s alfred wouldn t compare to gough s but i was wrong they re both great pat hingle was really good \( as commissioner gordon \) in this movie hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series and i enjoyed them both in batman returns but in batman forever i didn t like them nearly as much and in batman robin i found their characters annoying as hell vicki vale s \( kim basinger \) investigation into bruce wayne s background is completely uninteresting but i already knew what she would find out so maybe that s why i didn t like those scenes i also found the vicki character annoying screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen there s lots of little things i love in this movie the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him \( and the terrified expression of the gunmen \) with elfman s dramatic music blaring the look on napier s face when he sees the emptied safe when the guy got fried by the joker s joy buzzer \( one of the worst deaths i ve ever seen in a movie \) when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise and the joker s speech right before a mob boss dies the first action news report of the movie the way urgent is written in messy crayon on the parcel when batman jumps through the skylight \( accompanied by elfman s music \) the design of the batmobile minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave \( again elfman s music is awesome \) the grin on the young jack napier the batmobile attacking the chemical factory the joker s facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd when the bat signal is lit but it s not as awesome as the first time it s lit in batman returns or when it s lit at the end of mask of the phantasm and now a few complaints this movie featured too many songs by prince after a while they get unbearably annoying there were lots of other great 80s pop songs that could have \( and should have \) been used in this movie another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring by the way you can tell that nicholson s make up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking burton s batwing is cooler than schumacher s batwing \( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm \) anyway the targeting system of burton s batwing seems a little screwed up batman has a big red target locked on the joker but the plane s missiles and machine guns miss their target and the joker didn t even try to get out of the way looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems i always overlooked this movie s flaws \( until i saw batman begins \) for two reasons first of all i found keaton s batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie second of all the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is pretty much everytime the joker or the batman aren t onscreen the movie is boring but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie

well you know the drill some people will like anything that is artsy or out of the ordinary or made by that great director its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless the movie is about incest it is about sex and adolescence and ironically it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews the best part of this movie is eva green or more precisely eva green s body i didn t care about her acting \( i thought it was mediocre \) i just sat there and drunk her body in wishing that i was that lucky actor \( whats his name again \) the only reason to watch this movie is eva green if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation then i am glad it happened the movie is visually rich in fact its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see but i will take it he captures and celebrates eve green s stunning body every square millimeter of it \( including her genitals the movie is nc17 for a reason \) to perfection other than that there is nothing else in the movie the story is utterly insipid the old movie clips the discussion of morality or whatever nothing interesting the music is another plus point bottomline watch it for eva green s body it deserves five stars but the movie deserves only two	negative
what a disaster stay away from this film i was so disappointed how could this have won the academy award the story is rambling and confused as if the filmmakers couldn t decide what story they wanted to tell the animation is very average with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes in fact those all important happy feet of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit \( that s supposed to be tap dancing that s supposed to be animation \) the jokes aren t particularly funny \( with the exception of a few moments in the middle where robin williams briefly shines \) and oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing there s not a single original song or even an inspired remake of any of the songs think billy elliot meets the march of the penguins with some of gore s an inconvenient truth mixed in without any of the wit charm intelligence passion or beauty in any of those films \( did i mention that this film is a disaster \) perhaps most annoyingly like the rest of the story the underlying political message alternates between cliched confused and heavy handed the ending is especially unbearable with its tacked on feel and absurd psuedo environmentalist feel good solution what a joke personally i consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions \( i ve been a vegetarian for more than 20 years and a member of sierra club and peta for example \) yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message one final note for those of you with children this is not really a kids movie most of the jokes won t be understood by children under 15 for kids under 6 all this feeble film offers is some too scary shamus \( orcas \) a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid friendly forums as the united nations \( what the heck \) after sitting through the entire film to this point my four year old son finally turned to me and quietly said this is not a movie for me i couldn t have agreed more	negative
it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes it gets shocks like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes it gets more interesting as the plot unravels great actors picked for such roles the perfect killing machines one insane in the brain and one out to save lives that shouldn t be lost in the first place the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says i just want to eat i don t wanna hurt you then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal and his reporter female friend comes in and says good meal as a question that is and he says without words makes a happy sigh that s hilarious and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food priceless movie worth the watch again and again i m glad i saw this on tv when i was younger and i m glad i got this on dv	positive

went to see this movie at the imax in san antonio this weekend i have to say i actually laughed most of the way through the effects were decent but most of the time i had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3d effects that was when i wasn t having to look around the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie some of the torture scenes and the faustian plotline along with the hideous firey face that is mr d make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10 but the terrible plot along with the worst voice acting i have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10 basically i guess you could say i was slightly displeased with the movie i do have to admit that i got a hearty laugh when the main character johnny \( played by jasper steverlinck an up and coming rocker and lead singer of the band arid a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot i could find in the movie \) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil mr d and destroy the haunted castle unfortunately the scene was designed to be serious	negative
like many of the reviewers here i am an anne rice fan however i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them i mean few of the dracula movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker s novel all i wanted and expected was a flashy no substance guilty pleasure movie a la dracula 2000 that alone should tell you my expectations but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure the storyline didn t make a lot of sense when taken on it s own and the acting was bad to bland i also take issue with the badly done look of the vampires rice s vampires are supposed to be beautiful whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house however one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat since the videos are included on the dvd it earns 1 star	negative

this movie was so horrible i don t know where to start maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street or maybe he just casted his own family at any rate they were untrained and stale secondly i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi christian plays why wouldn t this movie director have enough sense to follow suit if you re trying to actually sale to a christian audience furthermore i thought the bible said a little something against divorce like it wasn t permitted unless your spouse commits adultery fornication this movie seems to say it s okay to go against the word of god if you re in love in fact christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice by even the protagonist i laugh as i think of the scene where ce ce peniston s character says seductively i m looking for a man with his mind on jesus yet she s dressed like a hooker speaking of clothing why did ce ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene they go on a date and she s dressed one way by the time they come home she has on something different with no logical explanation and please explain why they had someone s grandfather playing the role of rico suave maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman s dream i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him in addition the soundtrack it was just annoying at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music i just wanted the maddness to stop lastly it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate \( although some are \) however having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just well almost juvenile perhaps even a disrespect to women at large overall this movie made me want to puke pastor larry flash jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity	negative

let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language	negative

with a good script and a director better suited to the material \( i ve read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct \) asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson unfortunately the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist s wife \( an excellent natasha richardson \) and one of the asylum s patients \( an equally good marton csokas \) under the watchful eye of the patient s doctor \( ian mckellen \) there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie some of which seem quite preposterous at least in the way the movie was shot the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson she does her best in spite of the choppy script and she even won a best actress award in london for this film however as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job \( in fact i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson credited as an executive producer sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out	negative

as a character movie this is largely a failure unless you find poignancy in average ness the characters are all one note half stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non existent plot oh look how average they are isn t it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing it s so lifelike and the main character s seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her if this is intended to be an issue movie with the message robert ebert has suggested \( that anti abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women \) it s taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows munich and syriana also bring to light ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things perhaps next they ll make a movie to make the point that shockingly enough the sky is blue or that paint dries when applied to walls or that grass grows i imagine they d be somewhat more interesting than this effort	negative
if you are a ghits sac fan this dvd is a must series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well in fact the tachikoma s are now back in action in the series too graphic wise 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie the cg is allot more fine tuned and the action is awesome the opener has also improved significantly for the series sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5 1 dts japanese 5 1 dts english with stereo for both and there are english subtitles if you chose to run it with japanese audio overall they squealed sac season 1 perfectly this not a series to miss if you re a shell fan	positive
musicals are historically slight in the plot department and this movie is no exception three stars one fading one rising and one coasting do not help matters either rita is the fading star it was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow the make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes and her hair and costumes are just bad novak is the rising star although i don t get the 50 s obsession with bubble headed busty bleach blond bimbos it would help if she could act but sadly her range is very limited i truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic since she was unable to convey it herself then there is frank just coasting on his charm and cool doesn t seem plausible that a hep cat like him who could bag any doll dame or mouse would fall for either of these gals anyway i gave it 2 stars because of snuffy the dog he stole every scene he was in although that wasn t too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie	negative
i bought this dvd because i really adore the strokes good music good people good style not so good documentary whoever made this video should not make anymore at all the strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures 10 second clips of them the exclusive interviews were not that exclusive no sound from any of the strokes no interviews with them i can go on i mean c mon a documentary of the strokes should at least have the strokes in it right	negative
when we tried to play the item on our dvd player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it we ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer which worked properly i am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded i can see deducting shipping and handling but a restocking charge that is outrageous the merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it please remind me not to buy from amazon com	negative

maybe it s because i had never read the book and never heard of hunter s thompson before this movie but i found this movie to be unbearably boring and so utterly pointless at what point in the movie making process while reading the script aloud did they realize that this isn t a movie or maybe that the book couldn t be made into a commercial movie the story if it can be called such is apparently about a journalist and his fat hispanic friend \( called his lawyer \) who go to las vegas to write an article on some motorcycle race of some sort or something that s completely irrelevant because probably 5 10 minutes is actually spent on that subject with an additional 20 minutes at most devoted to the guy actually trying to accomplish the task the rest is just johnny depp as the main character rambling mindlessly about a variety of subjects most of which deal with drugs or drug related things others having nothing at all to do with anything they are quite literally taking every drug known to mankind and the movie chronicles them taking drugs there are some scenes in which the duo are in their hotel room where the lawyer freaks out in a bathtub and threatens to kill himself in other scenes they are in the hotel club or at a restaurant no matter where they are they are always high on some drug and johnny depp s character \( thompson himself based on his experience under a fake name \) is rambling or talking very very quickly and nonsensically there are cameos by minor celebrities some of which are world famous today gary busey is on screen for all of three or four minutes as a highway sheriff who sexually harrasses jd s character tobey maguire is on even less as a hitchhiker who bails out of the car when he realizes the duo are stoned out of their mind and crazy the only moment in which i had a great laugh was in the beginning where they are hallucinating that they are being attacked by bats as they drive down a desert highway when the lawyer stops to pick up the hitchhiker jd s char says we can t stop here this is bat country that line and its delivery alone deserve the movie its one miserable star i expected better from terry gilliam if this movie was attempting to be shocking or pro or anti drug or stylish or artistic in some way it is obviously only a most acquired taste like a group of people who think consuming waste is an acquired taste there is no moral message here nothing pro or anti drug nothing shocking save that these two aren t dead by the third day from taking so many drugs or stylish or artistic not the worst movie ever but definitely one of them i don t know what orifice people pull this great movie idea out of but i d like to examine that and find out why	negative
every lakers fan i ve ever met lives in the past sadly now to them the clock stopped when kareem and magic hung up the shoes and we know why magic had to leave their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding after this however they don t have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization the lakers have been a good team over the decades as apparent on this dvd set but the run of greatness is coming to a long slide with kobe driving the bus the lakers were once considered the green bay packers of the nfl but now they re just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the western conference which are much better than the present lakers i recently attended a game last fall at the staples center and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands i could barely hear myself think over phil jackson s mantra i told you so further illustrating how things have changed in la jack nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow so it is understandable that laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of magic and kareem than rather extol the diminishing skills of kobe since his colorado folly there are some good games on this dvd along with great moments from the baylor chamberlain west days i recommend any laker fan to purchase this dvd set to relive the past so laker fans keep living in the past if you so desire maybe kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the lakers to the nba championship promised land once again long live the forum or the staple remover center or whatever they are calling the lakers home now	negative
this film starts out so promising it could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief and the legitimacy of the concept of free will instead the characters dribble into infantile sexuality and the film becomes a travelog i can t believe this film found financing a real waste of obvious talent the effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste	negative
i loved these guys as a kid this collection sucks don t buy it the first 3 dvd s are silent and the 5th dvd is a reunion show the grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4 take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually if i could get my money back i would run to the nearest post office and return this item asap	negative

i m the first to confess that i had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 robert wise gothic noir the house on telegraph hill but it doesn t matter because all the actors are good and combined with an extremely effective plot the movie is a terrific tale of murder deceit and assumed identities in post world war san francisco as was the fashion with many noir films of the time the house on telegraph hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine she tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened however the narrative soon jumps to germany at the end of the war and we meet victoria kopwelska \( valentina cortese \) is a polish woman imprisoned in belsen with her husband and family dead victoria tells the kindly american commander major marc bennett \( william lundigan \) that there s nothing for her back in poland desperate to survive victoria learns that her best friend has family in the united states and if they are ever freed she promises to take victoria to america with her her friend however is killed shortly before american troops can liberate the camp with nowhere to go victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend s papers and sail to america where she learns now the godmother to a young boy chris \( gordon gebert \) as well as the heir to a sizable fortune and a gorgeously gothic house high atop telegraph hill following the death of her aunt ensconced in the ostensible mansion victoria now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy s guardian alan spender \( richard basehart \) partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security as victoria becomes a mother to the boy she clashes with his governess margaret \( fay baker \) and coincidently reconnects with marc whom she met a belsen now a studly a playboy type lawyer all the adults are not as they seem marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money and victoria s arrival causes him to draft a new scheme victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good and then there s the margaret the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to chris are all they seem the film is compelling and tension fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white cortese is especially good in one of her first american roles and as victoria she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade yet through no fault of her own she steadily becomes a victim of alan s scheming of particular note are the stunning location shots of san francisco the main house is just beautiful and the scenes when victoria is playing baseball with chris offer stunning views of san francisco bay the house on telegraph hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers there s a runaway car poisoned orange juice an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity it all makes for a gripping and entertaining film victoria starts out as a victim and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on telegraph hill her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and chris mike leonard april 06	positive
sorry i couldn t come up with a better punchline but this movie doesn t deserve any original thought or ideas maybe its because there aren t any original ideas in this movie event national lampoon used to mean funny now its french for crapola avoid this one at all costs watch caddyshack ii airplane ii yes even xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one	negative
the main character came across as gay to me too this movie is in no way realistic the other reviewer is right about everything it s a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick the martial arts in the movie are weak and sloppy there s no way that crap would actually work in real life i don t even know why i bothered to watch the whole thing i guess i just found the stupidity amusing the cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie unfortunately that s the only thing they put much effort into i rented it from block buster too they need to burn it this movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something like they had to make a movie to pass drama class	negative
i found this movie delightful from the storyline directing and photography to the actors i especially loved the performances of timothy bottoms and chloris leachman it s an enlightening movie that makes an important point sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all	positive
the so called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor a three year old will laugh at anything every turn of the plot is stupid this is in the running for the worst movie ever made i don t trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now i think he is a very good actor it s a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in to get his career going	negative
this is a dvd that i thought was dated not it was made in 2002 3 and deserves wide viewing i thought i may have seen the title but i had not it may be confused with other previous similar titles dont pass this by it is gritty and artistically realistic the grit of south central l a is authentic and has its own particular big city beauty of a slum area share this dvd or title with friends it is well worth the ride in a black and white it is similar to the shield on fx but deals with the rodney king riots in l a as a backdrop	positive
con express has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action isn t enough and in between stunt pieces and shoot outs the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions isn t really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a big budget company producing this i d be inclined to pan it entirely but i wasn t expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over the top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably won t mind this one too much just go easy on it	negative
i m sorry but this is honestly one of the worst movies i ve ever had the displeasure of witnessing i purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be in reality it s nearly everything that s wrong with low budget films first off the camera work is horrible secondly i ve seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays i mean these actors make keanu reeves look like denzel washington and finally the story was absolutely horribly done i admit the premise itself had some promise but the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor i might have had plain and simply this film was unwatchable i turned it off 65 through it and i would ve turned it off earlier but i was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen if you care at all about quality in any sense do not go near this piece of trash	negative

these are not your typical teens they love broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage so here they are at camp ovation honing their skills one of the teachers is a song songwriter because he is also a one hit wonder he s an angry alcoholic the other characters \( teenagers \) are a fag hag a cross dresser a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self esteem there is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie if you like musicals you will proberly like this but might bore most people	negative

this movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90 s and probably my favorite plot twister who done it along with m night shamylans films this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress neve campbell and denise richards who are both perfect for they re rolls the whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable which is unexpected from john mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from csi the 2 girls have it in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich i was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet matt dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool i do miss neve campbell i wish she d come back to films and it looks like she will so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99 9 of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole it thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of cool form that shoot well i did anyway	positive

hallmark entertainment has made many movies from children s books and this probably one of the worst based on both alice in wonderland and through the looking glass this movie stars many of the familiar faces of hallmark movies and children s movies such as gene wilder miranda richardson martin short and whoopi goldberg the lead character of alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good the movie revolves around her and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression even the crying scenes seemed fake where is dakota fanning when you need her the cinematography costume and set design are spot on as usual for hallmark movies but the soundtrack was unnoticeable the only bright spot was the engaging song by gene wilder s character all in all quite boring	negative
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio	negative

i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that don t make sense	negative
i m going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie i have seen plenty of russian films and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component mikhalkov for example is a director who can do this this movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson although the acting isn t necessarily bad you don t get attached to the characters i got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn t match the movie s theme and plot at times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching even though i never do that anyway i do not recommend this movie if you want to watch some good russian movies go with brother burnt by the sun prisoner of the mountains war or unfinished piece for the mechanical piano	negative
i can t believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video easy to master i found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow the camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork i am an athletic twenty three year old girl who is not a slow learner i just excercised with this dvd for the first time and it was really tough i didn t get a work out at all because i was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much she doesn t break down the moves at all and it s just so much more confusing than it needs to be the dances are cute but it s frustrating that she doesn t explain the moves i hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing	negative
i love this show it is well written superbly cast and always fun to watch i highly recommend	positive
another product of hollywood s karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in u 571 an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies \( german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors \) and absurd scenarios \( an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit \) put this ridiculous movie in its own category u 571 is just another thin over promoted throw away movie you ll forget the day after you see it	negative

it s always a shame to see a really talented actor actress star in a dud of a movie but that s exactly what happened to jodie foster with 1979 s foxes directed by adrian lyne who would later go on to direct the notorious fatal attraction foxes is a cheap lame brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life the movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another making it hard to stay focused the movie isn t a total waste a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention and jodie foster still under 18 when this was filmed has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn t given much to work with plus that piano melody of donna summer s on the radio which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel overall though foxes really is pretty lousy and can t be given much of a recommendation	negative
i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today the message is still clear those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie this is certainly one of burt lancaster s better roles and he plays it with much guesto if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background this movie has a strong message don t listen to the word of god from others if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible do so in your own way do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money even in this modern day and age the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong mr bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek re election everyone who is a born again christian or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty \( if there is one \) still a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today	positive
this pilot is so bad the acting the writing the directing the costumes it s a miracle that b5 ever got even one season approved by the suits at least they could have gotten decent actors pretty much every character on this pilot is represented by a piss poor actor and the writing is grade school \( i think this is what real people do \) tripe horrible rotten useless junk	negative

the manchurian candidate is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring frank sinatra this film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone this is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies afraid to assert a viewpoint the script meanders denzel washington plays the sinatra role of ben markoe he seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines washington normally a gifted actor plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role markoe discovers that his gulf war comrade in arms raymond shaw soon to be the next vice president of the united states has been the subject of mind control experimentation by manchurian global a vast multinational conglomerate raymond s handler is his senator mother \( meryl streep in the role of an ice queen \) by diluting the threat from communism to capitalism the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story after all it is no great achievement to convince a major american political candidate to back big business and so the grotesqueries of shaw s brainwashing get lost against the backdrop seeming less heinous than merely greedy even when shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious amoral and possibly incestuous mother why the film created the unlikely manchurian global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the manchurian global mindset that has gripped hollywood god forbid we should point a finger at mainland china \( or anyplace else \) it might reduce the bottom line this film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original	negative

it has been a long time since i read the novel upon which this book is based but i do clearly remember it making sense this movie doesn t even make sense \( to quote a chicken i know \) marlon brando somnambulizes his way through the film and instead of coming off as sinister menacing and dominating he makes dr moreau into a joke val kilmer s portrayal is vacuous and silly is the character supposed to be under the influence i guess he wanted it portrayed that way the script is there one moreau talks about having almost reached his goal where his one son and his daughter do have some fine traits but both are also pretty ineffectual several reviews have mentioned the special effects i actually saw very few special effects the rat people on the boat were creepy and well done and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves but mostly i saw people in very elaborate well done costumes using well distorted voices the central character played by david thewlis should have been the focus of the movie as he is the narrator he kept getting lost in the shuffle and i kept waiting for him to see things that i saw and to ask the questions that i would have asked i like him as an actor but this is certainly not a memorably good performance it is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal human hybrid horror here but is the werewolf in harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the film does create a sense of the nightmare several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness most notably ron perlman s preacher but then he s well practiced from his beauty and the beast television series that was what \( barely \) earned this film its second star let s vote them all off the island and start over robert duvall as moreau replace kilmer with matt damon casey affleck replacing david thewlis	negative
a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there s no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it s a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film doesn t have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they ll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	positive

tihs dvd truly has incredible camerawork and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins but some things people don t realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told please take the time to read this many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim with programs and circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets concealing them and are dragged ashore making it easier to violently wrestle them into slings these dolphins captured while they may be smiling in appearance \( which is the way their faces were genetically designed \) are ripped away from their beloved podmates and torn from their environment how would you like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water forced to live with the loud sounds of people screaming the filtration system running and very little space to swim in the process of capturing dolphins for human entertainment many die in the process stress severely affects a dolphin s body and many suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution on top of that dependent calves \( baby dolphins \) who have spent the entirety of their lives with their mothers often get torn from them leaving them helpless even if they are released while you can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to be having fun would it not be too much to consider the fact that they might miss their former companions are they really happier stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be fed keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or swim with program for dolphins captured in japan the industry has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly in the process by the government i believe this film spends too little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to dolphins over 7 000 000 dolphins have died at the hands of humans since the late 1950s i think a few minutes at the beginning of the film doesn t nearly suit the need to inform the audience of the issue tuna fisheries whose products are falsely labeled as dolphin safe \( there are established kill minimums now for tuna companies \) need to be exposed intentional killings in japan \( especially \) south america and all over the world need to be publicized but i also understand that this is a family film mainly but i think it is also important to inform young viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans they are the ones who will need to make the difference in the future please just remember this next time you watch this film while dolphins are valued by many they are targeted by many as well as a way of easy money making this film is more of a sugar coated production although it certainly is beautiful as are the dolphins seen in the flim i would recommend a film entitled dolphin defender for those who seek some informative footage behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive hunts	positive
a very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex christian we need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general i wish some brave person would do a film about how christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective this film touched on the subject but it was not really the focus of the documentary perhaps we will be blessed by a further exploration of the subject in the future	positive
if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you ninjaman elephantman nitty kutchie boom dandemite harry toddler and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format but it still shines despite these flaws the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick and doesn t do bad at all at the acting thing	positive
i echo most of the previous reviews this hayley mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent mary stewart novel that it shares some of its title with hayley was too young to be the novel s heroine and so for this film the plot and romance were youthened sanitized \( though the novel s romance was also chaste \) and also very much dumbed down as a featherweight hayley mills film this is harmless and very much a lesser disney film of the 60s just don t expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it even with your kids of today as a retro laugh	positive
scrubs has been a model of consistency in its five seasons and to interrupt myself why aren t we anticipating season five instead of season four and boo on them for being so slow to bring the show out on dvd and season four is no exception i recently rewatched seasons 1 through 3 on dvd with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present if you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it isn t as good as it used to be but i would be dishonest if i said that i detected any decline one thing i ve really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies this one really does have an overall story arc and i really appreciate bill lawrence and co taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way the story in season four revolves largely around the very very gradual repair of the friendship between jd and elliott fans of the show know that at the end of season three jd utterly smitten by elliott had expressed his love for her causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with jd no sooner had he done this however he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her season four opens with her filled with hatred of him complicated by the fact that she and he are named co chief residents \( though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads thanks to janitor chief resident and his misleadingly reads co chief resident causing many to imagine that she is over him \) some of my favorite visuals in the series are of jd and elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office barely large enough for the desk they face each other across of course eventually they patch things up but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement given the intensity of the events of the ends of season three any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with elliott murdering jd the season ends with carla and turk urging jd to move out and get a place of his own which leads to an interesting roommate situation in season five season four continued the scrubs tradition of having some very high profile guest stars this was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful colin farrell on one episode an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored \( there have been very few bad episodes of scrubs but this episode ranks near the bottom \) the always delightful heather graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season matthew perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father jonathan bennett perry a country singer best known to most people as the old spice sailor tara reid puts in another appearance as jd s terrible sometimes girlfriend while molly shannon is in another episode and julianna margulies of er appears in a couple of episodes the great tragedy with scrubs is that it remains something of a secret the only comedy better than scrubs in the past few years has been arrested development \( most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well and the lead of each show appeared on the other zach braff as the producer of the girls with low self esteem series of videos on ar and jason bateman as a patient on scrubs \) and while it won a large number of awards its ratings were worse than scrubs this show has decent ratings but shockingly few awards how terrible shows like everybody loves raymond and the formerly good but now dull will and grace beat it out for awards is mystifying and how did it manage only one emmy nomination it was nominated for best comedy series but why wasn t zach braff nominated for best comic actor and john c mcginley and donald faison for best supporting actor in a comedy series and sarah chalke for best supporting actress in a comedy series how is that possible much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory \( lauren graham yet again not nominated though clearly the best comic actress on tv for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her lost not nominated no nominations for veronica mars jason lee not nominated for my name is earl neither michael chiklis hugh laurie nor james gandolofini nominated for best actor while martin sheen who was barely appeared in this year s west wing while shows way way way way past their prime like will and grace and the west wing nominated and the list goes on \) but zach braff s failure to be nominated while charlie sheen and kevin james did is just one more reason not to take the emmys seriously at all at least the golden globes more or else get it right anyway awards aside and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the emmys \( how many emmy nods did buffy get despite most of the nation s best tv critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved \) fans of the show will be delighted with season four and if you aren t a fan you should be but don t start with season four go back and do it right either buy or rent \( i recommend buying you ll want to watch this more than once \) season one then work your way forward many pleasurable hours will result	positive
i was just surfing the shelves at borders today when i stumbled over queen kelly on dvd i couldn t believe it i have just been getting interested in silent films \( i m 18 \) and of course i m a gloria swanson fan \( who isn t \) having seen her brilliant performance in sunset blvd anyway i had always heard rumors about queen kelly the incomplete forgotten masterpiece i had to pay a whopping money for this dvd but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny first of all this film is old you can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well let s just say the music is annoyingly intense but the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch the story takes place in the 20s but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago now i want to concentrate on the story and the performances gloria swanson s performance in queen kelly has to be one of her best she was every bit as good in this film as in sunset blvd we can easily see why she was such a huge silent star her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story this was really melodrama at its best people tend to forget i think that melodrama can be an art form stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism the main event here is the story wow it s tragic that the film \( and the story \) were never finished but who knows it s just begging for a megabucks remake with nicole kidman now that the musicals are back maybe silents will be next	positive

phillip hoffman is searching for purity unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild hollywood movie crew and they are off and shooting in waterford vermont because main street is already there it is cheaper than building a set then the town folks new englanders dry and pragmatic mingle with hollywood slime balls daft smooth talking director william h macy and screen idol young girl chasing alex baldwin sarah j parker of sex in the city fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight small town smart girl rebecca pigeon and writer hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love a scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor s dinner party there is plenty of manic fun here i recommend for a good laugh also is it just me or is william h macy the best actor in the world	positive
this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo 66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	negative

apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film but when i re watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so i found it to be well nearly unwatchable what s so bad about it well how shall i begin \( 1 \) sean connery is a dud there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond but here he seems like he s just going through the motions to be fair he had no decent material to play the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007 he seems suitably worn out at various points and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before but these are grace notes by and large connery is stiff as a board here \( 2 \) the action scenes are uninspiring i m not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes here the action is strictly second rate \( 3 \) kim basinger and barbara carrera though great to look at give terrible performances \( 4 \) there is literally no reason to see this in favor of thunderball of which it is a remake the original remains one of the all time great screen entertainments and this remake makes zero improvements in fact the plot merely becomes muddled \( 5 \) there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles rowan atkinson s comic scenes though brief are painfully unfunny not to mention out of place the actor playing the new m is odious and whoever it is playing q isn t very good either \( 6 \) the music is bad the title song is boring and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon i couldn t care less that the james bond theme is missing it s not what isn t there that s bad it s what is there all in all i d have to say that unless we re counting the 1967 version of casino royale this is the worst of the james bond movies it s worth seeing if you ve never seen it before but that s about it in my opinion	negative

robert redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl the state of art in all its wholeness redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator this picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious artistic and perfect american film in the last quarter of century besides the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss redford s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and i really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent and so the new directors to come understand the true cinema meaning is art thanks to his generous personal effort for having created the sundance festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years scarlet johansson	positive
somehow this movie touched my heart and my mind and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime however it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things like first love impossible to re capture and in a sense haunting i am not obsessive in any way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times with each time revealing another layer of meaning and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles maybe their best ever in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category so buy it and watch it you ll be glad you did mik	positive

one of the most compelling events of the release of kenneth lonergan s you can count on me is that it gave visibility to mark ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash lives of life of unattached agony and isolation he s a loner and a drifter medicating his self pity with pot and short lived relationships his sister sammy played wonderfully by laura linney reacts to the same tragedy by being in many ways an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash this film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another the ride is never easy in this film no easy answers are given just as important this film which deals with the pain of loss never descends into the maudlin hallmark movie sap that other films would balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss amazingly he does it in a fast paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic matthew broderick for example plays a hilarious role of sammy s neurotic anal retentive boss at the bank the conflict between him and sammy leads to a plot point that i ll let you discover in the film but most of all this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such an endearing sympathetic sometimes infuriating character you won t forget him	positive
great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost didn t finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira s voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	negative

i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i d just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	negative

if you love well written stories great plots and captivating acting then this movie is not for you i don t know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie however there it is it was so boring and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes i had to turn it off i don t even want to know how it ended the cast line up was great that s the only positive comment i can make with regards to this movie do not watch it do not hire it do not believe anybody who thinks it is good the two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly get this it was done in the missionary position avoid this movie	negative

quinceanera happy birthday amos lassen and literary pride one of the great mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie quinceanera a traditional rite of passage it takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood magdalena \( emily rios \) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret she is pregnant she was raised a devout catholic girl and the fact that she is with child shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her distraught by her banishment from her family magdalena turns to her uncle tomas \( chalo gonzales \) who lives with her cousin carlos \( jesse garcia \) in a small apartment in echo park los angeles carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood what results is a m nage a trios between carlos and the couple one a television producer and the other a british citizen carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes magdalena s new family unit in effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper middle class men what results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in american films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with performances are excellent in the film and the directors richard glatzner and wash westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen emily rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and chalo gonzalez as uncle tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten he is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal everything about this movie is fine the script the actors the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 sundance festival quinceanera is a marvelous film especially because it wears its queerness so well the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality maturation culture clashes and love simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed	positive
my boyfriend and i went to this movie we both hated it it was really pathetic perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people it is pathetic i would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with low self esteem do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this perhaps it is funny but just do not be around one of these people in reality it is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are not all men are virgins like this man but some might as well be because they have no clue about women they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand	negative
this movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing it presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes it takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience it is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace it is full of laughs joe pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time i don t think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of vinny nearly as well marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great the writing and directing two things that often get overlooked was wonderful the only weakness the case is a little fantastic it is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime of course movie plots don t have to make perfect sense but this stretches it though i usually don t like excessive foul language this movie uses it in a funny way i guess it wouldn t work without it but don t be mistaken it has a lot of bad language don t let kids under 17 watch it without supervision	positive
this version wind and cloud the storm riders made in 2004 is not the same as the storm riders made in 1998 this dvd is a condensed version of a tv series packaged by tai seng it is full screen and was made for tv it is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours most people doing the reviews for this dvd is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring aaron kwok and ekin chen	negative
so what kind of movie is this from the director of i know what you did last summer it s basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set up and similar function deep down venom is just another teen slasher movie they rode into this film with the same clich d scares a young group of teens a psycho killer and a traditional ending so is it worth seeing that i can t completely answer for you if you like more of the same old then it s probably going to be a blast the filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane overused plot i found some parts to be slightly unpredictable and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film the voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply an unstoppable evil force but individually do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece quite frankly in my opinion at least no let s take a look at some of them acting well done well directed too i might add the acting is realistic to a degree and brings us into the film the actors responded \( for the most part \) realistically to the story line and i think that this was set up nicely the major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo lighting dim dark and mysterious the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film combined with the swamp like location i think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful special effects they set this up pretty well a few scenes made me cringe and i felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it or bled them out for it the gore wasn t excessive but just right for a slasher film and props to the director for making that call my only qualm with this is that they used the standard halloween stage blood which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color a few of the actors squirm around in it only to look like they re rolling around in pizza sauce there are a few other tacky special effects including the last major one in the film the killer mr jangles enough said sounds like a dog i ll give the killer credit for being a good actor but the portrayal needed a lot of work the make up kicked it up a notch but the slow motion style jumps and action movie style stunts didn t do it justice the man looked like an athlete and moved like one not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits although i don t specifically know what that looks like i m sure they don t run like football players so what overall it s ok not something i d be dying to see and i m glad that i didn t run to the theatre to catch the first showing it has some good moments and some bad but doesn t really stand out from any normal hollywood production my recommendation it s ok i d rather go rent containment instead the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind it s good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again	negative
this version bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story the book was a simple good story why did they abandon it and the characters so completely the sets and costumes are great but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period i have only watched the first disc but it be a while before i will be able to force myself to watch the others	negative

this movie has the feel of a late night monster fest hosted by svengoolie or elvira i had no idea what this was about when i started watching it but by the end i wished i would have skipped it entirely the story starts off well with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster \( that you don t see at first \) from there it goes downhill it felt like a low rent pet sematary i have never read the short story that this was based off of but i m sure that king made his scarier than this movie could ever be the best acting in the movie comes from brad dourif best known for his performance as billy bibbit in one flew over the cuckoo s nest and the voice of chucky the killer doll from child s play as an exterminator	negative

paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do with them these key concepts come courtesy of philip k dick via his original short story though the film poorly represents the themes and conceits that have made his stories into unforgettable classics as a thriller paycheck depends upon our identification with its imperiled hero but the movie is never able to make us truly care about ben affleck s michael jennings or his fragile state of mind and that s something dick would have found unforgivable only uma thurman really earns her paycheck here the premise is high concept and the prophetic threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion but paycheck is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes the future world created by john woo isn t nearly as engaging or convincing as say the captivating science fiction setting crafted by stephen spielberg for another high profile dick adaptation minority report for paycheck the comparison is not flattering sadly woo can t even keep himself from forcing his own creative preoccupations into the film and a resulting motorcycle chase sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film s low some scenes are enjoyable and there are fleeting flashes of wit and excitement but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately conceived or placed paycheck isn t a smart film and what s more it sometimes assumes that its audience isn t even paying attention as a result the film never comes close to living up to its potential the material and the audience deserve better unfortunately paycheck is forgettable fare and truly it is without any real payoff brian a dixon revelation magazin	negative
there are just some trilogy s that should not be made and the wild things trilogy is one of them this is not really a trilogy per se since each of the films carries with it the same story with the same twists if you have seen the first you have basically seen each of the sequels except the sequels are both much worse take out the big name actors and make a direct to dvd release and you have wild things diamonds in the rough i am sure you all know the story by now but here is a brief synopsis things get steamy in blue bay florida when marie a 17 year old beauty gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double crossing after meeting the promiscuous elena the new girl at school will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme if you have seen one of the wild things films you have seen them all this film lacks the quality of the original mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come this disc does look great and sounds pretty good but the film takes away from the overall dvd presentation if you want your wild things fix the original version is the one to watch	negative

the first was one of the best thrillers ever with clever suspence good characters decent acting and awesome effects this one is meh why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight to video series what s the bloody point now there are some good parts the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent but you know that doesn t even save it this movie is a annoying pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love it is so un intelligent it really makes you wanna puke the characters are nothing but cardboard cut outs i don t even know them well all they do is scream run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut i also really hate the effects in this one as well they felt like they were over used there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was the direction is ok but when it comes to adding wierdness it s too much i don t understand the story there s a strange sex scene which a cube movie does not need cube is about suspence this one is just about adding too much effects a four dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one you don t need that stuff if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first add something original don t take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original but no you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it s a cube movie you don t need nudity overall if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap go ahead i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes if you re a fan of cube dont bother acting 3 10 ugh don t get me started these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die gore factor 4 10 cgi gore come on t a 1 10 a cube movie doesn t need nudity and they don t know that because they don t know cube direction 7 10 andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms but you know i can t say he s a great director he turned the franchise with straight to video written all over it bottom line if you wanna watch go ahead then you ll be sorry this movie is just sad it doesn t try anything to impress you because it s idiotic lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again	negative
this is without a doubt one of harrison fords greatest moments an incredible film with some of the best visual effects i ve ever seen very dramatic with a lot of suspense a very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view a film you will want to see again and again action mystery drama thriller there are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such but they don t in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama i highly recommend it	positive
i don t often watch foreign films the reason being as an american i don t feel that i can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works french spanish german etc regardless of nationality genre or time period they generally leave me cold with that in mind i went into this with no doubts as to the film s greatness but again didn t think as an american i would be able to see it as the situational nuances would be lost on me as it turned out i was wrong and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily and didn t seem obtuse or foreign the experience could best be likened to watching the graduate as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching i won t recap the storyline or discuss details of the movie itself i just wanted to say that i went into this skeptical expecting to find a picture that i couldn t relate to but what i found was an immediate compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition	positive

i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits smiling laughing joking around man man who reminds me of my doggie hair head i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there but no it was just a 20 second clip i was so disappointed and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety they just weren t funny on a positive note there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet it brought me to tears and the bonus featuring phil s audition was quite interesting but overall i don t recommend it	negative
i found this to be a absurd movie it just has alot of things in it that are just too far fetched and the plot itself wasn t a strong one at that to me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie and it just didn t work it tried to be a movie that all the family could watch and it didn t work it tried to be a disaster movie and it didn t work it tried to be a drama and again it didn t work i got a few chuckles out of it it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that i watched it but it was just sloppy and uneven and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning	negative
this is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning one does not need to love the results of these changes \( i personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it even as i marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election \) to appreciate how clinton s 1992 campaign as seen in this film changed the american political world war room should be seen along with more recent documentaries \( like for example staffers 04 \) to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal \( to be elected rather than to govern \) hopefully it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless mind numbing dumbing down assessments of candidate traits \( like character or integrity \) we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years	positive

just today i randomly selected a movie that movie was henry i had never heard of it before and i figured that i was in for your average run of the mill low budget slasher flick though it is low budget it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie in fact the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study meet henry a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition watch as he goes to work watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people this film does not exploit the violence though it is very frank and direct treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park this movie is a lot of things and when it was all over i just had to sit back and take a few breaths have a cigarette and try to gauge my reaction \( s \) i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing it is also pretty funny in some parts though only funny in the blackest sense of the term there is no social commentary in this movie nor does it provide any closure the dvd is great awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas awaiting lethal injection on death row very fascinating	positive
the story of alice in wonderland was controversial from the moment that the reverend charles lutwidge dodgson aka lewis carroll wrote it some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy others consider alice s journey as a trip into or through insanity for better or worse disney did capture many of these elements and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film however there are also those who loved the books and loved the film normally i recommend disney classis without reservations in the case of this movie i will keep a couple of provisos alice is a young girl bored by her lessons as the length of the lessons grows alice soon drifts off until a white rabbit passes by muttering to himself that he is late alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever luckily for alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent once at the bottom of the hole alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small however there is a vial labeled drink me that alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation indeed alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film even the fundamental basis of alice s journey through wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies the ending of alice s journey in particular is quite frightening especially to younger children embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares i remember seeing alice in wonderland as a child and i remember i thought the ending was scary and i was relieved when alice was able to escape back to the normal world given that this film is well over fifty years old i was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does the smoke did negatively affect alice as it made her cough perhaps there is an object lesson for children here while some consider many of the references to allude to drugs i think that is a modern interpretation i think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use remember that this story was first published in 1869 i believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by disney for all these provisos this film is excellent it matches fantasia in its surreal visions and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb the animation is marvelous as well readily illustrating the vision of alice s journey this movie is one of those rare disney films that i am unable to recommend to all viewers whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste if you enjoy animation oriented toward adults then you may find this animation a treat if you are open minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated you may also find that you enjoy it i do recommend this movie for slightly older children perhaps 8 and above considering some of the disturbing images good luck	positive
this movie ended where tyrese gibson and meagan good meet up again in mexico but heck they are both fugitives hiding from the law how is this a proper happy ending although i will admit meagan good is a fine looking young lady just knowing that she was in this film got me to want to watch it however i don t understand the appeal of these kinds of films violent black gangsta films with lots of foul language gun play and just bad tempered attitudes even that music sounds like it would stir up hatred and provoke violence and harm to anyone just passing by i wish people would get rid of that what are you looking at mentality that just seems to encourage fear to innocent people just passing by my wife is asian and her older sister married an hispanic guy we go to their house every thanksgiving and christmas nothing makes my holidays more depressing than to have to go over to his house and have to watch these violent gangsta movies with his kids i m trying to teach my kids to not have any prejudices of other races but these kinds of films make the black race look bad there wasn t very many positive messages in this movie and if black people are so offended by the use of the n word then why do they keep using it themselves if it s such an offensive term then they need to stop using it themselves these kinds of movies promote and glorify the ugly side of being black in the big city black people need to do more movies with more positive themes we gotta work together if we re going to diminish our black and white prejudices i wish my brother in law would stop having this kind of crap on his tv when i have my children over it s hard to talk to him about it especially when he thinks there is nothing wrong with our kids watching these kinds of films what s more it s hard to reason with someone that has to use the f word in every sentence i m really beginning to struggle with my prejudices within my own family	negative

i think woody allen is the best director currently in the business and i believe his serious themed movies are the reason he excells at making us look at ourselves if i m not mistaken interiors was his first venture into dramatic movies for having led the way this movie is noteworthy however it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the woody allen movie it defines the woody allen film by showing us what it is not woody allen s greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves his characters have faults that we share whatever passions that we have fallen prey to we see them in a new light through allen s masterful script and direction the problem with interiors is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in interiors have many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by ingar bergman allen s own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it taken in its own right interiors is an above average movie the acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner the movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess these people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other woody allen cast \( with the bumbling exception of the cast of what s new pussycat \) woody allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way fortunately he learned from his experience	positive

what a great idea to make a documentary of violinist hilary hahn traveling around the world and concertizing undoubtedly at the top of her profession hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone enviable precision and brilliant musicality this dvd portrait includes personal footage of hahn backstage at the philharmonie in berlin as well as a tour at the curtis institute a recording session at abbey road studios and a trip to hong kong in an age of music commercialism hahn is refreshingly real and self deprecating included on this dvd are excerpts from the korngold concerto mozart sonata for piano and violin in g major the lark ascending by vaughan williams chaconne from partita in d minor by bach and the paganini concerto no 1 on the menu there is additional concerto footage which includes the korngold concerto and mozart sonata in their entirety thank goodness because there s nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts if for nothing else buy the dvd for these complete live recordings because they are absolutely sublime the outer movements of the korngold sound a lot like film music which the classical music lover may or may not like but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended the mozart sonata is also very well played but this is nothing new as hahn has already released a recording of this this dvd is important because it contains video footage of hahn performing the only other dvd where you can find her playing is the last night of the proms in which she plays the mozart concerto no 4 in d major and presto from sonata no 1 by bach but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn t do justice to hahn	positive
this dvd version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable hayley mills is her usual irrepressible self and the supporting cast is top notch the feline actor in particular \) i don t quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format it didn t bother me at all disappointment i could understand but this kind of vitriol it s still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages and i found it a refreshing change from the dumbed down kid s movies they tend to make these days adults will enjoy the suspenseful story retro style and feline antics just as much as kids will i d skip the remake and get the original	positive
i had heard a lot about how funny margaret cho was and finally got a chance to watch her video i find her way overrated she does have some funny stuff she s got a particular knack for doing impressions and there s some other genuinely funny material however the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience she does a lot of vulgar material homosexual oriented jokes etc that are clearly just there for the outlaw value and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she s personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base it s just not funny	negative

i was so disappointed in this film the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting i love terrance he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis tennessee in this day and time and did terrance howard give ludacris character a cassette tape to listen to not a cd a tape i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too and the hook to that song you know it s hard out here for a pimp ya think with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed don t get me wrong i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don t quite bring it do we the cookout how high girl 6 woo kingdom come now we can add hustle and flow to the list i m glad terrance howard redeemed himself in crash do yourself a favor and pass on this one	negative
george clooney and quentin tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time it s sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys this whole flick is akin to getting a gift wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper problem is as is often the case with tarantino and robert rodriguez ain t nothin inside the package get it these guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever the word shallow comes to mind there is nothing there and i doubt that there ever will be however having said that i must give credit where credit is due juliette lewis the talented juliette lewis is terrific as usual good to see harvey keitel do his thing same goes for fred williamson the rarely seen michael parks \( this guy by the way made some terrific country type records back in the 60 s and we wish he d do more he s up there with merle haggard in my humble opinion \) and last but not least the beautiful salma hayek is also in this although she hardly does enough she still had the curves back then in addition to the above we could have done without all the obvious and crappy cgi effects at the end the stuff just doesn t work never did by the way the documentary full tilt boogie is way better than the main feature	negative

i m not sure what compelled me to seek out americano written and directed by kevin noland it s not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson a star of tv s dawson s creek perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper s inclusion in such a small scale production i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar here however the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film maybe it was international star leonor varela a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america most likely though it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain with great scenery bull fights hemingway hard drinking and partying the running of the bulls the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing however i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works the film is photographed well and has good performances my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming of age story with an astounding lack of real character insight this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat the setup is simple as recent college graduates jackson and two pals \( who bicker comically \) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the real world and a new job facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood work and independence freedom and monotony dreams and reality jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure should he stay in spain these are legitimate questions and a legitimate albeit familiar story path what makes americano so tedious and uninvolving however is that the film doesn t allow you to know its characters a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off and americano doesn t succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation we never know anything about jackson s job or life in america or his dreams passions interests etc aside from this fleeting romance sure the film goes through the requisite motions jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway what else would you expect in spain if he has artistic aspirations however the screenplay surely never develops this lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life i simply fell into the camp of who cares there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture dennis hopper s role however as a club host is a complete misfire ultimately though my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth sure jackson s at a crossroads but lacking any understanding of what he wants it made no difference to me what he chose sorry but that s a big problem when it is your film s central theme kgharris 02 07	negative

in 1987 and 1988 jim henson s the storyteller aired and became an instant showpiece for television a truimphant \( but short lived \) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser known northern european fairy tales and later into four timeless stories drawn from greek mythology these old folk and fairy tales mined from countries such as germany and russia and compiled in 2 discs here along with the greek tales are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers john hurt for the european fables and michael gambon for the greek re tellings but with much respect to mr gambon who himself does a fine job it is john hurt who decidedly draws my attention hurt with the more eye catching portrayal is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes it doesn t hurt that the stories featuring hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by anthony minghella who nearly a decade later would win an oscar for directing the english patient as such jim henson s the storyteller gloriously lives up to its titular billing john hurt s performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make up he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories minghella s screenplays are replete with rich witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up the kids of course won t have that frame of reference but still watching these episodes it really does feel as if you re sitting around the fire enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns michael gambon on the other hand is burdened with the weightier and grimmer greek tales thus he eschews john hurt s light ebullient touch opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona he s pretty good mind you but in the final analysis he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to john hurt both hurt and gambon by the way are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog \( as operated by brian henson \) at a half hour per episode jim henson s the storyteller is presented in a marriage of live acting creative animatronics and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery jim henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values coming up with excellent special effects \( for its time \) seamless puppetry matte paintings and yeoman make up work all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting a charming quirk of the series which adds a nice touch is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the storyteller and his dog the camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace but somewhere in the background whether it s on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup images depicting the story are set in motion pretty neat the stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid s fable we re used to over here especially the greek entries and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones \( the soldier and death the heartless giant \) but don t keep the kids from watching this series everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories it does help that most of these tales are little known in the states thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there when was the last time cinderella or beauty and the beast timeless as they are offer up anything new this is just about as perfect as television shows can get the only flaw i can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever all the episodes are superb but if i had to pick the best of the pack i would definitely go with hans my hedgehog the soldier and death and the three ravens with

hollywood make them then they break them stars can fall as fast as they rise sometimes they rise again and sometimes they disappear and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in the big picture a quirky cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of it has a few awkward stretches but overall it s a darkly witty cult comedy \( you re tracking failure all over my carpet \) nick chapman \( kevin bacon \) is the winner at an arty student movie competition and instantly agents are chasing him all over l a in no time he s the rising young director with a movie deal at a major movie corporation but he s also starting to lose sight of his old life as he tries to become a major success he changes the style plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics turning it into a beach bums naked ghost movie he dumps his pretty girlfriend \( emily longstreth \) for a bimbo actress \( teri hatcher \) when the studio head gets dropped nick falls as quickly as he rose but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance an arty music video this time can he get it right christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries tackling everything from small town musicals to folk festivals his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz but his talents are just as present in a typical movie and guest does a smart quirky job of it the lesson be true to yourself and your art don t fall for empty glitz and don t let success go to your head if you re lucky enough to get it the story is a pretty straightforward one nick gets great success it goes to his head he falls and he rises again a wiser man and the movie falls into straightforward lines without many unpredictable plot twists at first glance it doesn t seem that unusual what makes it special well simply put guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick s life not to mention the glorious dialogue when speaking of nick s one n only music video a studio woman announces it s the best one yet and i ve seen em all and guest manages to show us agents artists students directors and actors but never descended to cliches they re real people no matter how nasty and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet where he confesses i wanna be your friend again and he s backed by good performances by longstreth michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh big picture treads where many movies have gone before but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video a must see	positive

i used to think he was great till i caught the director s cut of das boot all of a sudden you re confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn t in the original and the spell is broken let s not even talk about air force one now i ve seen the perfect storm twice and i own the book but i still haven t read it because i m reasonably sure the book must suck if the movie is this bad and i m sorry new england but what are gloucestermen anyways except for great rapers of the high seas what will they not do for a buck you might ask ok they are not as bad as the japanese but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there s no tomorrow watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu sure you will find excitement aplenty amped up to eleven even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history i even like some of the principal actors but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be this just doesn t stand up to repeat viewings unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker do you	negative
i have been a long time radiohead fan and like many others have been waiting patiently for a live dvd so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old i couldn t help being disappointed when i watched this dvd the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch in fact i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime i ve always that radiohead was modern progressive and totally innovative i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey and it doesn t help that before every song thom mutters this is a new one	negative

with the 70 million that was spent on the 2005 video game inspired film doom you d think that director andrzej bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly on second thought given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of shoot the mutants it s pretty clear that mr bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment as to the film s plot it can be summarized in a single sentence a group of ber soldiers lead by their sarge \( played by the rock \) travel to mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh eating mutants after injecting a criminal with dna recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a martian archaeological dig so there s tons of shooting a lot of screams gallons of fake blood guts being tossed about a martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small scale version of the sphere others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include karl urban \( ber soldier john grimm \) and rosamund pike \( as john grimm s sister named sam \) why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in doom defies logic to anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1 star film in a theater you have my deepest sympathy to anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of doom on dvd please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price that alone should tell you how good this film is	negative
in the golden age of hollywood each studio usually took a stab all various genres but excelled in only one warner brothers cornered gangster films with forays into musicals \( busby berkeley \) and noir \( bogart \) universal dabbled in lots of b films but succeeded big time with horror mgm of course produced the best musicals fox did melodramas especially noir with an occasional romp on mgm s musical turf and usually those romps hit some really bad notes witness the first three flicks in their marquee musicals series daddy long legs has astaire and caron pin up girl has betty grable week end in havana has alice faye and carmen miranda the memory of these films for the most part is a lot better than the films themselves the pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going and make one yearn for mickey and judy	negative

i thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in detroit all the time time i was learning every new motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits i had no knowledge of the funk brothers i grew up on detroit s north end and a lot of the motown stars came from this area i connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow covered english tudor homes on detroit s northwest side the film has wonderful themes fame success heartbreak the beauty of friendship among musicians failure to be recognized recognition much too late and attempts of redemption if not apology i think the whole city of detroit or at least my part of it was heartbroken with the news that motown was moving to los angeles in the film the musicians are given their due a la their cubano brothers and sisters in buena vista social club	positive

when dvds came out i thought that cds were gone i thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling dvds instead of cds that s what happened with records cds came out and no one released vinyl anymore i am so glad that the sun was the first band to do this every song on this disk is golden there ain t a bad song in the bunch i heard about this disk on npr radio it seems that it was taking warner bros so long to release the cd that the band made homemade videos for all their songs the record company heard about this watched the videos and said that s cool here is some more money go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a dvd like it was a new idea or something i talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks all the songs are on the disk in wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell windows media player or whatever you use to put it on a regular cd and play it in your car or convert them into mp3s there is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the wav files i could go on and on about how much i love this disk i played it for my wife kids coworkers and they all loved it like other reviewers said the sun is a new classic keep it up boys	positive
this movie creeped me out and not in a good way johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross maybe it s the michael jackson ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face could they have picked a more horrible look for ww it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 wig and 5 clown makup on him i love tim burton s other movies but this one sucked bigtime it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from this movie is childish if you re an adult and pales compared to the original if you re a kid it s way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking auntie zoe what does that mean when are screenwriters going to figure it out either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie it s really hard to do both in the same film it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids they end up appealing to nobody maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing it s amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton if you are not a fan of either don t waste your time with this steaming pile of poo	negative

if the girls in this film were considered hot back in 1979 then i m glad i was still in preschool some unattractive women not college age girls but actual 30 year old women who cannot get into the popular pi sorority start their own sorority called h o t s which stands for help out the seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie the goal of the h o t s girls is to steal all the guys away from pi house so they throw wild parties jump topless out of a airplane \( too bad the camera was on the ground \) fly a hot air balloon over the pi house to launch pies on the pi girls as they sunbathe topless etc the script seems to have been written by a 12 year old which isn t a bad thing i liked the fast paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice unfortunately i didn t find any of the girls even remotely attractive if this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with nikki ziering brittany daniel shannon elizabeth and jenna jameson as the four main h o t s girls and maybe catherine bell as the house mom it would gross over 800 million in dvd sales i also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots how rude	negative

i totally love this dvd they really show how to do grooves not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video these are grooves you can make your own and go and dance any where with that what i think makes this dvd series totally different from the rest the moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch it goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it love it love it love it i am hooked on the groovaloos	positive

as a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed city of the living dead and zombie i was very disappointed with house by the cemetery fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two thirds of the movie only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes house by the cemetery is about an researcher \( whose work is never specified \) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress the titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment so dr boyle his wife lucy and their son bob move in despite a lot of bad signs like the boarded up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a dr jacob tess freudstein in the front hall bob has little red headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is \( though no one else sees her \) furthermore people keep claiming dr boyle has been in town before with a non existent daughter \( which he denies not totally convincingly \) he also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter anne who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night and lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues got that good because half of that stuff never gets explained the only things that get worked out are the little red headed girl s identity and the identity of the killer \( neither of which are that hard to figure out \) there are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film \( the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand the photograph that changes with each viewing a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding \) but fulci s ability to handle the gore moments disappoints he lingers too long over some deaths makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter s head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary compared to the injury to the eye scene in zombie or christopher george chopping through the coffin in cotld dr boyle s chopping through the door around his son s head feels like self parody fulci s other films have incoherent plots but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot \( the dream like nature of city of the living dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat \) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic house by the cemetery has neither thing working in its favor it s not hell of the living dead level bad but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting \( especially paolo malco who plays dr boyle \) and an interesting set up almost make the flaws worse also this version has a never before seen deleted scene but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack	negative

after watching spirited away i was excited to watch other movies by the same director unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic it s bad to hate message what the creators of princess mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive disgusting things of the world yes hate can become overly consuming just as any other emotion can overcome us or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one s \( just as loving that which is evil wouldn t be a good thing \) but placed in its proper context at the proper time at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems and the people who claim that hate is all evil themselves hate the haters which i find comical the movie also has strong pro feminist anti man messages i wanted to like this film but i don t appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense	negative

why did they even bother transferring this movie to dvd seriously the child of a masterpiece the vanishing sports some of the most half hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90 s this isn t a matter of comparison this movie all by itself just sucks if i hadn t seen the original i d just think what a brilliant plot too bad they decided to bury it \( no pun intended \) with everything else in the movie jeff bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great gut wrenchingly disturbing hitchcockian 1988 movie sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are themselves which add nothing to the movie and the ending oh the ending we ve been cheated totally cheated all the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of it has to be upbeat hollywood cornball syndrome sandra bullock is rescued the villain is hit with a shovel and everything is a ok even though kiefer sutherland s original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated this is of a great movie	negative

eraserhead is filled with strange uncanny scenes what is it to be uncanny dictionary com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis beyond the ordinary or normal mysterious arousing superstitious fear or dread uncomfortably strange i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere the movie does not have a linear logical storyline it is a mood piece for want of a better term a visual poem which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen if you let your mind play among these images it will begin to invent meaning for itself you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it the cinematography is stunning not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term but arresting you simply cannot turn your head away will you like it well i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate think of it as a rorshach how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are	positive

vci s budget dvd starts out well enough for the obscure thriller lady ice with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come unfortunately as soon as the credits end the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs i ve ever seen on dvd pass on this one from vci and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits	negative
one of the warmest most pleasantly lip smacking film s ever made by a guy with a super sized heart america is a joyous celebration of the burger and the down home folks who create some of the most wonderfully odd versions of it take it from someone who has the hamburger america poster hanging up this little treasure is a home library essential	positive
my kids \( age 5 7 and 10 \) love this movie i actually bought the vhs version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the dvd so we could watch it in the car when while traveling my husband and i originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it s nice that we can share it with our own kids now if you love animals this movie is for you the dvd jacket says this movie took a few years to make and i believe it it s absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other this has got to be one of the best animal films out there	positive
it is the declining days of the great war \( wwi \) the germans are leaving a small french town but are leaving a little present for the advancing british troops they have buried the munitions in the town square when the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded the town s people evacuate during this the barber sends off a message to the british the british decide to send a man to check this out they choose the bumbling scottish private plumpick \( alan bates \) located on the outskirts of town is an asylum the sisters who run the asylum escape with the town s people leaving the inmates to fend for themselves they return to the town resuming their lives before being commited plumpick arrives in town but doesn t know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum he meets the beautiful coquelicat \( genevieve bujold \) and falls in love with her he finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb \( of course it s more complex and hilarious than just that \) he also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town s people the funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people so shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves this is half fairy tale and half fable alan bates gives a great performance and genevieve bujold shows great whimsy dvd extras none	positive
2 1 2 stars this is a very good concert teaming up a pre grammy santana with wayne shorter of weather report fame great rhythm section drums conga timbale top notch musicians first rate performance very entertaining my big problem comes with the quality of the dvd i don t see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states dd 2 0 dd 5 1 and dts the menus are showing something else \( dd2 0 dts 2 0 and dts 5 1 \) but neither dts stream seem to be working only dd stereo works i own close to 200 dvd s and all work fine dts and all bought it directly from amazon i had it replaced and the new one is the same this is not part of the great live at montreux series productions which are all great no matter how old the concert is so the 2 1 2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star dvd quality	negative

the station agent is a touching yet off the beaten path kind of flick that i found simply endearing to watch fin \( peter dinklage \) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in new jersey having a passion for trains he embraces this as his home however he only wishes to be left alone and finds that s not as easy to do as he would have thought first he discovers joe \( bobby cannavale \) who has set up a food truck outside his home joe is a conversationalist desperate to talk to anyone and everyone next fin meets olivia \( patricia clarkson \) who almost runs him off the road twice these three appear to have nothing in common and despite all odds they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see all three actors gave amazing performances dinklage as always commands every scene he is in i ve missed seeing him since the bastards at cbs quashed threshold so it was nice to see something with him in it again cannavale amused me with his character joe who really needed to get a life the idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least and clarkson radiated as olivia a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her what i liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through fin s eyes there were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average plus there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier didn t even see that he was standing there so she didn t ring him up until he could get her attention it just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically all in all excellent film	positive

as someone said in an earlier review the movie is split up into two parts the first part training camp was good i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam after that i found it unwatchable the main character is so annoying i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast if you re looking for a good war movie look elsewhere	negative
but i m giving season four 4 stars because there aren t any subtitles in this set they also didn t have subtitles for season 3 but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 2 strange huh however the quality of the dvds are fine and the episodes of course are wonderful to watch at the end of this season the meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good but he decides to stay with the bunkers a little longer so he can get his masters degree there aren t any special features or anything in this dvd set but as long as the episodes are uncut i m happy if you re a fan of the show this dvd set is a must have	positive

they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome then all of the sudden the paid wwe guys just began to bad mouth the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young and i really can t distinguish one s ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use which drugs presumably they re talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let s not talk about that let s just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him i don t he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk and oh yeah they don t even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from imdb com that he was asked to appear but declined why don t they address this this docu is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking	negative
i love me some mamet his dialogue takes some getting used to since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm i also love his dedication to his actors employing the same ones over and over so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe which may very well be his point however edmond is the first mamet film to leave me disappointed and worse annoyed macy plays edmond with typical wide eyed aplomb edmond is a man who is weak but is valiantly \( if not clumsily \) trying to be strong the movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film edmond then goes home breaks up with his wife and goes on a deaf dumb and blind search for himself finding instead over priced whores pimps who are not what they seem and generally everything but himself i get the point edmond is the epitome of modern man s emasculation unable to find his own balls with both hands and his tawdry and panicked search through new york for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go \( man or woman \) to find if not redemption then the places where one belongs there are a lot of problems here most superficially there s one of packaging the dvd box prominently features a picture of a gun and no gun appears in the film the tags on the box call the film alternately a mystery and a fast paced thriller when it is neither one of those things not even close this movie is \( like most of mamet s work \) based on a play never before has it been more obvious \( unless you count the absolutely brilliant oleanna \) edmond is essentially a one man show with macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters \( some of them played well denise richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker and some of them not so well julia stiles seems over medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress \) in spite of how they do and don t help edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself most of these characters seem disposable making the movie come across as equally dismissable \( i would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about rebecca pidgeon mamet s wife an actress who appears i think in every single one of her husband s films this woman is viewed in even the nicest of lights one of the worst actresses i ve ever seen and she sucks the life out of every scene she s in in this movie she plays edmond s wife and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence it s nice that mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does but one has to wonder if she d ever get any acting work at all if she weren t married to such a famous writer director \) at the risk of spoiling the film i will say that at the end edmond finally does find where he belongs a place that given his previous struggles makes a lot of sense \( although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers \) but this is small consolation since by this time few people are likely to have any sympathy for edmond or where he ends up his character s slap dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate fear destiny and \( ironically \) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience a few good performances and some nice visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along avoid this flick try oleanna or glen gary glenross instead	negative

truly frightening gruesome a gore fest a bloodbath and it has a plot really there are a lot of clich expressions to describe this movie but they re all true it s a horror movie in the true sense of the word i hadn t seen a rob zombie movie before this one but i would have to say after seeing it that it s got to be his masterpiece i don t see how he could top it house of 1000 corpses is not a movie that people who don t like the genre should be watching i don t think they d be able to stomach it it s a downward spiral of evil depredation degradation and mayhem out of an imagination that must be really sick \( but awesome \) the sense of humor in the movie actually doesn t spoil it it just makes it better it s so malicious the atmosphere the acting the special effects and makeup everything contributes to an hour and a half long ride through a freak show that shouldn t be missed by true horror movie buffs buy it rent it whatever if you love being scared you ll love this movie it delivers	positive
spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health eat nothing but mcdonald s fast food for 30 days the result his health gets ruined while spurlock s experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health i rarely eat mcdonalds \( though i enjoy the odd coke \) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia as it is worldwide the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food and made ray kroc \( its founder \) a fortune i don t really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil because they are multinational corporations we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers as well as shareholders we happily buy coke mcdonalds cigarettes and many other things obviously bad for our health and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad in our individualistic culture we tend to all too readily avoid self responsibility and the virtue of self control and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists however the rocketing levels of obesity especially amoung children are of great concern and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents spurlock s experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously and not ignoring them for the sake of self indulgence	positive
this movie is so dumb that it s as good with the sound off as with the sound on the only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads a plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an ok movie with a good script but this script has no charm no wit no nothing	negative
this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today s teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom s thing	positive

whether william golding deserved nobel prize or not is still a debatable point but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book and its name is lord of the flies but let s not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while because after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi layered world of words onto the screen even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that you can interpret the meaning of lord of the flies but who can really visualize it or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter the biggest problem of harry hook s new version is not the changes done to the film the boys are american military school cadets using dirty words frequently but those parts didn t annoy me much real problem is something more essential to the film which is storytelling in short the 1990 film doesn t know what it wants to be on the film s video cover you can read \( and i quote \) this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul well not exactly for as adventure story it lacks pace the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer and piggy s role should be more than that of a whining fat boy and don t forget simon who sees things it is true but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne s adventure stories by watching this film you can follow the story of the book but find no tension or thought provoking words in it balthazar getty s feature film debut and lewis m allen one of the producers of the film had also produced peter brook version in 1963	negative
what a huge disappointment this release is i was suspecting that it wouldn t be all that great when i saw that the studio that originally produced this show 20th century fox was the same video company releasing it well the first season looks horrible the source material is all 16mm dupe prints some parts of which are out of focus scratched and dirty in all cases the image is soft and well like 16mm compared to what fox is releasing of voyage to the bottom of the sea produced the same year \( 1964 \) and at the same studio as boone this release is nothing short of a disgrace we should be given pristine 35mm source material and we re not i suspect fox wouldn t release the original camera negs from it s vaults without a substantial fee anyway season one of daniel boone isn t worth buying i haven t seen season two when the show started filming in color but i m now afraid to look	negative

made in 1959 douglas sirk s imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago it s a real cinematic treat shameless tearjerker and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one s teenagers in this case daughters are growing up and preparing to enter the world lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom together with her young daughter susie they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand to mouth existence their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams one day at coney island lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane who is being taken care of by a black woman annie johnson \( juanita moore \) whom lora mistakes for the maid when told by her that she s the mother the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment lora is initially hesitant not because of annie s race but because she s struggling and doesn t have any money to pay her a wage eventually however she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night at the same time lora meets the extremely fine looking wannabe photographer steve archer \( john gavin \) steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage meanwhile the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress yet neglects her growing daughter in the process steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization but has trouble relating to lora s need to be independent and famous annie s heart is eventually broken gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success the contrast of the mother s compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story s ultimate paradox lora annie steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn t seem to be doing them much good they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them lora gets her career but she s unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother whilst sara jane perhaps the most damaged character achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother under douglas sirk s accomplished direction miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life especially lana s gorgeous outfits yet the film clocking in at over two hours is always compelling and is never boring the screenplay is sophisticated the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film the brilliant surfaces audacious colors and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy entrapment and emotional anxiety and where the price of following one s dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost mike leonard june 06	positive

in my 1 3 2007 review of the harry potter dvd series i said about alfonso cuar n s direction of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban that perhaps cuar n held back from doing his own thing because chris columbus had directed the previous harry potter releases and had oversight to azkaban well the notion that cuar n was holding back in his potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing children of men cuar n can indeed make a great movie and could have made azkaban great but it was just good greatness clearly shines through when cuar n is turned loose with his own film and children of men is a good example children of men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith and this is apparently what cuar n does best \( see 2001 directorial of oscar nominated y tu mam tambi n \) in children of men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born the result chaos clearly the end of the world is near zombies might as well have taken over the earth and it was that zombie movie \( you know the good ones like 28 days later 2002 or dawn of the dead 2004 \) desperation that i was reminded of throughout children of men cuar n adapts p d james 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties but keeps the message pretty much the same the story is believably told and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through clive owen leads the cast and this guy just gets better and better in every film that i see him in he s supported by julianne moore michael caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in a list performances a fair amount of action suspense a very well told story everything that you need to keep you entertained and hey did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for children of men you don t get that too often anymore	positive
the story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with mitchum in one of his nastiest roles it s almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in cape fear he meets his match in lillian gish s character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is sweet in fact the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film charles laughton in his only stint at directing does an excellent job but i think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension a very good example of film noir	positive

sorry but this movie blew the premise was there but the delivery just sucked i can only take the suspension of belief so far we are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf \( whom he s been w for at least a year \) about his last one before that and gf before that at least two of them have his home phone number they ve never called she s never seen the caller id she s never answered the phone give me a break then she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms she meets up with joyce \( the most recent \) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes and starts believing that the bf should really be with her joyce is none the wiser but if you ask me joyce had stalker qualities b c she harassed him when he was with the model calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone keeps that stupid boomerang in a frame etc this chick stacy \( brittany m \) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going holly hunter s character is precisely why i have more male friends than female stacy just met this woman and she s revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie i never expected the big climax but i did ask myself several times will this barb \( hh \) chick back the off on to the climax it was actually a surprise but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for stacy after she humiliated all those people i never got the impression that the bf \( derrick \) was cheating on her yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different the only reason he pissed me off was because he didn t read stacy the riot act in the end this movie tries to wax philosophical and you just end up hating all of the characters except for the dog a very passible movie i wouldn t even bother	negative

i really enjoyed this film basically the coen bros homage to the film noir genre \( i always thought the name was funny since it s french and yet most of famous directors were german like fritz lang otto preminger etc \) \) the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool unhurried nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey thornton is great in the lead as the reticent phlegmatic barber and if anything he is even more convincing with hair than without even his hairpiece is 50s ish \) the whole cast does a fine job in their roles and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of show stealing scenes i found the film s climax a complete surprise as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber for whom everything seems to be working out up till then overall a great film and probably one of the coen bros best if you re a coen bros fan you won t find this one a disappointment	positive
wow this was a pretty decent romantic comedy we had this in our collection for months \( possibly years \) and never watched it we decided to watch this film on a whim i have to say that it was better and ever funnier than i thought it would be monica potter is great in her role it s a sweet movie that actually doesn t do to much guy bashing \( the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies \) i am also a big fam of henry thomas and he is great at as well i won t go into the plot here as many others already have but what i am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres \( sweet home alabama 13 going on 30 \) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention the other thing that must be said is with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 \( and over 18 \) why isn t monica potter more famous than she is she can easily be the next julia roberts or meg ryan julia has 2 kids and meg has just hit the wall it s time for a beauty like monica potter to get into the very lucrative romantic comedy genre here s hoping she gets a better agent before it s to late cute movie with a good heart definetly made a date night at home wonderful mark \( for the record 32yrs old straight and yes i enjoyed this movie \)	positive

my wife and i huge fans of america s next top model and project runway were very excited about seeing this film why it took us this long still baffles me but as of friday night we had the pleasure of seeing the devil wears prada and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure now most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of meryl streep and while she was outstanding this film is more than just a meryl painted canvas there are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise first is anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as miranda priestly assistant at runway magazine anne hathaway proves with her performance that she s all grown up no that s not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like havoc and the masterpiece brokeback mountain but here anne proves that she can do adult comedy not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in the princess diaries but keeping everything smart and mature she has enough poise and grace to match wits with miranda and she does so elegantly next up is emily blunt who plays emily miranda s first assistant \( there are two andrea being the second \) emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is slaving for the unruly priestly and it s all about to pay off with a trip alongside miranda to paris the only thing standing in her way is andrea for if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on emily emily blunt turns out i think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her stanley tucci also does wonderfully here as nigel miranda s second in command he is there to make sure everything is perfect and also help andrea adjust stanley always has done great backup work playing second hand man to just about everyone but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it he delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the token gay guy he s needed in this film not filler and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd and then of course we have meryl streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as miranda priestly what i was most impressed about was the way meryl underplays every word every emotion every scene which is not what i expected i really expected her to go all glen close and reincarnate cruella but she didn t \( thankfully \) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year she must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor in chief of runway she lets us see inside her character briefly \( when crying over another failed marriage \) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don t get to see the real miranda because we re not supposed to carried by these four brilliant performances the devil wears prada is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone the script is brilliantly adapted from lauren weisberger s novel and while it s not an exact replica \( are any adaptations these days \) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and in my eyes more enjoyable bravo	positive
all things aside the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end stated this way without ruining the ending played a great part as a supporting actor his name is justin goncalves i think this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had i was particularly impressed with the part he played	positive
i ve seen it about 20 times now it doesn t get old the faces the moves and the lines of matthew perry are always fresh my husband likes selma a lot so it s a win win for both of us they are great together good stuff	positive
i just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience i must say i think i have figured it out in some other reviews i think batricia birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers i think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground it is somewhat of a good story i can see why it would be reversed \( a guy trying to get the girl instead of the other way around \) you see eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one also frenchie is not with the pink ladies at all you see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school i think the chemistry between stephanie and michael were worked well together the songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie so really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether i know i know it is not the first one but sequels are usually not but they usually have connections to the first grease 2 tried to accomplish with frenchie and the tbirds pink ladies and all i am glad they were able to have eve arden sid ceaser plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like tab hunter is this movie cheesy yes is it done in less than expected direction yes does it have good songs yes \( cool rider reproduction we ll always be together girl for all seasons turn back and back to school \) the song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one after all kiddies patricia birch did do the choreography for both so in closing this movie made it to my dvd collection if for that reason alone if grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek if it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that i think if you loved the first grease then i think you should at least give this one a try	positive
i remember putting season 9 as the worst season of friends in my book but it s not as bad as i remembered some episodes are actually incredibly funny the faux pas was when they started to have aisha tyler guess star as charlie and have her come between joey and ross also the whole story line with rachel s infatuation for joey could ve been better executed or shouldn t have been there at all it got bad towards the end but i m not disappointed the stuff leadings towards it was classic friends	positive

if your a fan of progressive rock you probably already know how good this cd is in my mind it is the single greatest cd of all time \( followed closely by operation mindcrime any of the great pink floyd and rush records \) my only complaint on this dvd is the sound i was at this show and the sound at the theater was great somewhere it didn t transfer to the recording it is not the worst thing i have ever heard but it doesn t show the bands power live every other aspect of this dvd is well worth the price i would not want to be with out it	positive
this is a nice item to add to a collection of d d trinkets but in no way is good it is lacking in story and acting a lot of the scenes were pleasant but i was never compelled by the story i would only recommend this to a hard core collector or a funny break from your current game	negative
i ll get to the plot of the gang s all here in a minute because the plot isn t the most memorable part of this movie the most memorable part is the bananas about 20 minutes into the movie a towering hat of technicolor fruitappears on the screen followed by its owner brazilian bombshell carmen miranda she proceeds to do a number called the lady in the tutti frutti hat accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas six foot tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number s end when the chorus girls worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island there s a reason this number occurs so early on it takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie but then this is busby berkeley a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war and next to kitsch war is pretty much the motivator here the wafer thin story involves andy \( james ellison \) a soldier who woos and wins edie \( alice faye \) a canteen dancer the nightbefore andy goes off to world war two in what seems an instant andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of andy s childhood sweetheart and fiancee who unfortunately for edie is not edie will the heartbreak be resolved do you really care the plot is mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major 40s stars \( in particular eugene pallette and edward everett horton are hilarious \) and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out of thin air \( in a couple of scenes benny goodman and his orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of it \) the gang s all here is really a 1943 time capsule but an eye popping rouser of one they don t make em like this anymore they didn t make em much like this back then either	positive
venom is one of those movies i thought i would hate because i heard so much negativity about it but i really enjoyed it being a fan of the 70 s and 80 s slashers i crave newer versions because i have seen all the other ones over and over again venom did not disappoint me it starts off with action and never lets up i found it to be one of my favorite new horror slasher flicks the voodoo angle was good but not overplayed i m simple in that i want to see a killer with an axe machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo i don t want to have to wonder was that a dream or was it real as so many movies these days play off of give me an old fashioned slice and dice and i m in heaven and venom gave me that so i hope to see venom 2 if so i m there \( for the record mr jangles used the hook chain before kane in see no evil \)	positive

after starting my 9 11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown what after loose change 2nd ed last year i ve watched and or read just about them all 9 11 press for truth comes out on top in my humble opinion as the best 9 11 timeline presentation out there nothing included that isn t in the mainstream press just on the back page and spread out over five years the film makes few of the outright accusations that loose change 2nd ed does towards any of the events or people involved in 9 11 but delivers more of damning argument that we ve been lied to there weren t just mistakes made but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government i hope that we the people finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out and the bad guys pay good movie	positive
as both a big fan of this movie and a film student i feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash this film has a sexy edge to it that many other films in the teen film genre dare to exhibit new best friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night without it actually becoming a reality the house is every girl s dream and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting the acting is far from terrible and it was great to see meredith monroe in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as andie in dawson s creek dominique swain once again puts in an a effort for her role as the cheeky deviant sydney for anyone who loved films like tart and cruel intentions this is the film for you	positive

zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on mafia and on this tour its really hard to take and i m glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on shot to hell bls are a great group but zakk s persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles blessed hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the cds stoned and drunk and funeral bell are critically altered to the point where i had to skip them i m actually starting to suspect that zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect because i can t imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way a few tunes sung this way i can handle buts its total overkill on this dvd the behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because zakk is a funny guy	negative
if you have not read the book then this movie may intrigue you it is quirky and interesting to say the least as a storyline it does not lack imagination from maine to vienna to nyc and back to maine from the jew hating german tourists to the radicals and the from one hotel new hampshire to another the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events and life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams now in relation to the actual book this movie can be described with just one word rushed the adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything all characters and all events thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family i could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily how the scenes lack emotional depth how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed but i will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short if the book was a long wave like function with a rise to a crest then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest over and over and over again then the movie was just a cross section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave like function shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender where they were shaken and served to please god knows what surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone and it was not for lack of effort it was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes a mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation either that or a more free flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture thank god for jodie foster s and beau bridges s performances who bring fanny and win berry to life keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience as far as this movie is concerned just toss it out as far as you can and if you are to keep it then do so to remind yourselves of how to not adapt a great book onto the screen this is the only reason why i keep mine	negative
standard disclaimer i love dream theater however this dvd is almost unbearable to watch due to all of the video effects that obscure the live performance didn t i buy a dvd of dream theater live so that i could see them play at times several minutes pass without showing the musicians as they re playing video effects such as swirling colors images of the artists upside down \( \) and black and white re enactments make the whole affair feel like someone was trying to create their first music video for mtv in 1984 or maybe trying to induce an epileptic seizure in the viewer dream theater would get a rating of 1000 but i d give this dvd a 0 if i could just goes to show what poor editing gets you	negative
i followed texhnolyze through it s fansubs waited patiently for each dvd to come out you don t have to sit and ponder look hard and deep to find a meaning in texhnolyze it hits you right in the face from the beginning there are some people out there that society likes to forget likes to shove to the backburners and ignore in this tale they are a whole race of people the people of the underground city of lux and even within them sides are chosen you re either in or your out ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows the only thing he knows his strength his brute force this point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes when ichise makes the decision to protect ran he s come to feel something for the girl and perhaps in a way she reminds him of the mother he could never save so he goes to offer the only thing he s sure of having his body that s always been his bargaining chip always been what everyone wanted anger rage and fighting though are all ichise knows how do you expect him to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him become it s clear through most of the show that he doesn t know how to react to people likewise it s the same old sort of theme out of many a popular sci fi movie man bringing about an end to his own world ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by his texhnolyze ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by some intricate connection but eventually lux collapses because of technology the classic warning given in so many apocalypse movies not each episode requires such in depth searches for meaning it all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the series itself this series as a whole is a very good series it does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes in mind as well as a little psychology but what good series doesn t	positive
this has always been a favorite film of mine the story is old fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine despite having the vhs i wanted more and ordered the dvd beware this dvd claims on its packaging to have closed captioning but it does not no subtitles in any language no line 21 captioning nor does it have anything else interactive menus means scene selections this plain vanilla release doesn t even have a trailer this film and cast deserves better and i see no reason lion s gate reissued this dvd with nothing added since i bought it online i can t return it and neither lion s gate nor artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people i bought it from	negative

less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor in like flint still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world s women while replacing powerful males with surgically altered substitutes \( leading to perhaps the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be a disbelieving flint says an actor as president \) that is until a renegade zowie general \( steve inhat \) decides it s his turn to take the reins of power the delightful lee j cobb is back as flint s curmudgeonly boss cramden as are the secret agent s posse of female admirers and tv s batgirl yvonne craig even shows up as a russian ballerina in like flint feels more grown up than the previous film partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind and charging a premium for them are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows cross dressing and the bouncing sing a long ball only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment as it s a staple of the genre meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort a no frills dvd	positive
season 1 of veronica mars took me by surprise and i really enjoyed the ride the second season however doesn t live up to the quality of the first instead of one large mystery in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve there s nothing wrong with that approach but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved another would pop right up without any resolution for the first many episodes ended with my friends and i turning to one another and asking is that it where s the rest of it this happened quite a bunch with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist that s totally out of character yet we never see that family the abused girl or hear about the incident again that type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up the major villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable because of the all the loose ends go nowhere plots and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline i m giving season 2 a 2 star rating season 2 of veronica mars still has some funny dialogue and some clever episodes but it doesn t deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews i ve seen i ll continue to watch however as veronica mars has a lot of promise hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3	negative
after seeing both peyton place and the sequel i can tell you that i could tolerate the recast carol lynley and tuesday weld were wonderful in their perspective parts but i have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well my reasons for asking the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie over and over in this film it is stated that selena was raped when she was thirteen yet in the original film selena alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school also she looked pretty mature for thirteen then there s selen as boyfriend \( whose name escapes me at the moment \) in the original film he stood by her through the murder charges the revelation of the rape and the miscarriage yet in the sequel i m suppose to buy that he couldn t handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of selena yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast i have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door it was all too obvious that the original film wasn t taken into account when writing the sequel not credible at all	negative
backbeat is an excellent portrayal of the hamburg phase of the early beatles and succeeds on every level although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of fifth beatle stuart sutcliffe the focus quickly shifts to john lennon who \( as in real life \) dominated the music and lives of the early beatles it is as much the story of stu and john as the story of stu and astrid and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships still it is a fascinating look at the early beatles who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough reeperbahn bars in the pre fame years the cast is excellent and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed the music is also excellent and complements the story perfectly in all backbeat is an entertaining journey through the world of the early beatles and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings	positive
this film i have to say is beautiful looking from the characters to the landscape although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects the only problem is the love between the two main characters the movie never lets you feel the love between them and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade right the main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it this film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals	positive
i was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd i would not recommend anyone buying this dvd until the quality is back to that of a professional recording	negative
i am convinced you have to be one of three things to enjoy this film male born before 1935 or a huge monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out marilyn is so annoying in this i wanted to smack her and tom ewell s character is equally a jerk i am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny is adultery funny not really i don t mean to sound so conservative in fact i m quite the opposite i m pretty liberal which may be why this movie bothered me so much it is very sexist and dated and monroe s usual portray of the harmless stupid breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn t very empowering to young women the character she portrays has no name is simply titled the girl a female puppet manufactured for pleasure the jokes are dated and fall flat no longer funny to modern society i think the seven year itch is one of the most overrated classics ever but what can i say my 84 year old grandmother enjoyed it maybe she was just nostalgic for the 50s a much better monroe comedy is some like it hot where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day	negative
i first saw this movie around 1980 when the cold war was still on i had been inundated with propaganda from birth that all russians talked about was political that they didn t do normal things or live a normal life all politics you know well here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women it was very well acted and basically just a long soap i loved it and not one word about lenin marx or anti americanisms i recently saw it again and liked it just as much for those who say it is unrealistic well how do you know do you think that all russians lived the exact same life or because american cold war propaganda stated that all russians were totally miserable	positive

i didn t give this five stars because it s some kind of oscar worthy achievement but if you are a fan of the quirky b grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties then this film is a must hawk offers hilarious jump cut editing dialogue that is spectacular in its badness and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film for all that the film is also remarkable for its innocence in a time when cheesecake t a fantasy like the sword and the sorceress and the infamous deathstalker series were the norm hawk the slayer keeps it clean and is all the funnier for it if you have the right sort of friends then snap this gem up invite them over for beer and pizza and have a go it s more than worth it	positive

this is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts away from the creepy angst of punks this wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women looking and acting sexy and leading productive respectable lives why not portray lesbians as beautiful educated clean classy talented sober drug free non violent non self destructive straight forward honest oh and truly sexy the reno landscape in the 50 s is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered the filming is top notch the sets and period clothing are spot on the musical scores are superb the cast was wonderful charbonneau and shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other just a masterful duette of performances cay free and fully out forward and knowing just what she wants vivian tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension two georgeous women making love hello the love scene is landmark audra lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as cay s stepmom cay s best friend silver is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people and deserve love and happiness we all need a little silver in our lives this story is completely intriguing and hey what a wonderful ending sequel sequel this is an absolute must have in any collection timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian love	positive
what a disappointment i absolutely loved the black pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel as it turned out i had every reason to be it whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original major or minor who seemed interesting that they did but unfortunately the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while keira must have somehow pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie legolas i mean orlando bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along sometimes good but more often haphazardly to my mind the only real interesting addition was that of davey jones except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying \( due to the tentacles n all \) at least his was a unique addition to the movie i do sort of object however to associating him with the flying dutchman legend the two have nothing to do with each other fantasy or not and don t get me started on the cannibals any way i think this movie merits the two y ars i gave it while considerably beneath that first movie it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times but it is most definitely not as good and as a final thought the very last scene of the movie lose it entirely it simply was unnecessary	negative
this comedy like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through the characters in this film can be hated at points especially michael douglas and matt dillon s but there is a lighter side owen wilson is very likeable as dupree an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job the cast is fine and one of the strength s in this film however i think it gets too serious at points this is supposed to be a comedy after all i wouldn t buy it but it is certainly worth renting	positive
at first i was skeptical about buying an aging mccartney band tour dvd even though i have every one so i bought it i watched it from start to finish unbelievably superb the lighting the energy of the band and the crowd suprising interviews and ole paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark after watching it i felt like i had been there it is the best one i have seen yet if you like mccartney this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear excellent buy	positive

emerged in the united states during the depression the term film noir \( french for black film \) first applied to hollywood movies by french critic nino frank in 1946 was unknown to most of the american filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film featuring top performances from the 40s and 50s with outstanding drama and screenplays along with a

the folks at pbs deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th century america this documentary covers sometimes comprehensively sometimes briefly virtually every important topic germane to the field of study from pictorialism to straight photography from fashion to the scientific along the way we are introduced \( or reintroduced \) to what has been the medium s most important uses journalism and documentary a century of images is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane concern over the ethical issues photographs present and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post industrial age on the psyche of our nation these themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving one memorable example the way edward curtis s images of native americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they really were sections on war photography cover wwi wwii vietnam and the gulf war with compassion and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in iraq another bonus the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness until i was able to buy this fabulous history on dvd my biggest complaint was that while using the vhs version i had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes i wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where i teach now that i can happily locate scenes at will using the dvd menu i can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings more on walker evans robert frank diane arbus please they were pretty damned influential	positive

bob clark s 1974 chiller classic which went on to inspire many elements of halloween and when a stranger calls is definitely one of the better if not best horror films out there period not high on blood but very high on suspense dread atmosphere and out of the dark surprises a sorority house \( to include the lovely olivia hussey the vulgar alcoholic margot kidder and sctv vet andrea martin \) falls victim to vicious violent and altogether menacing phone calls during the christmas holidays soon students on campus begin turning up missing though some events do go unexplained \( which could be positive considering the mystery involved \) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films with the most tense moody photography ever captured on film keir dullea and margot kidder turn in quite effective performances highly recommended	positive
i ve owned this workout for about three years i do it on occasion if i feel like i need to slap my legs in to shape it does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body however i have to force myself to do this video the 35 minute warm up is mundane and uninspired by the time i finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes i hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg i also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating in order for me to get through the video i have to put on some different music and turn the tv down until i can just barely hear the instructor s voice to know i m keeping up with the video in my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience	negative
another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it s because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	negative
the talons of weng chiang is a wonderfully creepy pseudo historical tale full of mood atmosphere and an unusual amount of violence for doctor who almost as if departing producer philip hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out but it s not all gloom and doom this storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old doctor who humor at its funniest as well as thrilling doctor who adventure at its most gruesome the dank and dour city streets and slums of late 19th century london make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation madness and serial murder \( technologically refined cannibalism really \) and yet the doctor s many clever quips and leela s naively astute observations on civilized victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout and the main villain s second hand man li hsen chang has some incredibly witty one liners as well li hsen chang himself is a fascinating character delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to weng chiang a stranded time traveling dictator from the future who has deceived chang into believing he s a deity from the taoist pantheon chang s paranormal powers foremost of which is hypnotism definitely evoke the late victorian fascination with mesmerism \( see the poster advertising his show \) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil fu manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction and yet he s also a tragic figure in many ways a healthy innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his god and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process in many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the pygmalion style educational program the doctor s putting leela through to her annoyance if li hsen chang is an interesting and complex adversary though the same can t really be said for his master weng chiang himself he s a rather unremarkable two dimensional villain i m afraid complete with hokey bad guy laugh and over the top acting perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect but if so they overdid it just a bit at times too he s just more annoying than frightening every time the ever loyal li hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the doctor weng chiang throws a fit savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum on this score weng chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one s workplace it doesn t help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he s presumably impersonating so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing all in all though this is an enjoyable adventure the doctor is at his sleuthing best leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting and anyway li hsen more than makes up for weng chiang s deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show while the cyborg assassin mr sin is genuinely creepy \( especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls \) so this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt or a dash of soy sauce rather	positive
cast denzel washington john goodman donald sutherland embeth davidtz james gandolfini elias koteas gabriel casseus michael j pagan running time 123 minutes rated r for violence and language fallen starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese \( elias koteas \) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes \( denzel washington \) looks on hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich \( glen witko \) in a bathtub having been poisoned the same way reese used to kill his victims at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta \( embeth davidtz \) who at first is reluctant to speak with him things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich charles \( robert joy \) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes ruining his life career setting him up for murder getting to his friends family hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him everyone he cares about charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character donald sutherland doesn t prove to have any range doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under rated actress she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future the directing and camera work in this movie was superb it was done in such a way where you can see azazel s spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town although this film does require your full attention it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours fallen is an intelligently written supremely efficiently executed and one of the most unheralded unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade one of the better of its kind	positive
this re telling of the so called zoot suit riots that rocked the los angeles homefront during world war ii gets the facts right but tells them rather poorly part of it is the super stagey presentation which basically is a filming of the play this was based on \( right down to the shaking props and backdrops \) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium plus edward james olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber symbolic voice of the barrio although daniel valdez and tyne daly \( \) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense anyone interested in the time period and in chicano politics may benefit from watching this i rented it while doing some reseach on the pachucho r b music scene but in dramatic and filmic terms this is not a first rate production it s hammy and ham fisted latter day star spotting el teatro campesion veteran robert beltran \( of future star trek voyager notoriety \) has a bit role as a modern day audience member	positive
i purchased this movie without reading the reviews based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i ve seen the two main stars in this movie was awful and the sad part is there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout the acting was obviously overdone on purpose i just wish i knew why it didn t come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent in the end i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it	negative
the changeling has become a little bit dated however it is still a very good ghost story the film stars \( george c scott \) as john russell a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident he rents a large estate in order to compose his music it is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy why is the boy haunting the estate why is he making contact with john russell as the film moves forward john russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion from what he can gather it was the former home of senator carmichael \( melvin douglas \) what ensues is the mystery of who the child is and who is senator carmichael what occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there this is more of a mystery than a horror film the suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy s wheelchair moves the film is dated and does not have the appeal it once had for me however it is still a good watch recommended	positive

this is an awesome movie i think its better than anchors aweigh gene kelly and frank sinatra are two baseball players named eddie o brien and dennis ryan who play for the wolves during the off season eddie and dennis are vaudeville stars when they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner k c higgins wants to take an active part in coaching as it turns out the k in k c higgins happens to stand for katherine \( esther williams \) so the new owner is a woman katherine dosn t fall for womanizer eddie so the two don t get along at all dennis does fall for her though but katherine isn t in love with him shirley delwyn \( betty garrett \) has her eyes on dennis and she won t give up on him also in the cast is jules munshin who plays nat goldberg dennis and eddie s baseball pal this movie has a lot of great music the songs include take me out to the ball game frank and gene sing this song as their vaudeville act also williams sings this while swimming in the pool yes indeedy the boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act its about their love life o brien to ryan to goldberg kelly sinatra and munshin sing this song one of the best numbers the right girl for me sinatra sings this song to williams it s fate baby garrett sings this to sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other strictly usa probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party upon st patrick s day kelly dances and sings to this great song he sorta does this irish gig kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was this is one of the best numbers up there w strictly usa at the end kelly sinatra williams garrett sing to strictly usa as the finale it really great the dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called baby face and boys and girls like you and me it also contains the trailers of anchors aweigh on the town and the trailer for this movie also includes notes on frank sinatra and gene kelly for some odd reason i love this movie this is a must see if you are a kelly fan	positive
driller killer has without question the best director s commentary of any dvd i have ever seen although driller killer is a far cry from his second film ms 45 it is a classic reno can t seem to buy a thrill despite the fact that he lives with two bombshells he can t get his painting finished to collect for the rent his agent s reaction to his finished painting is absolutely priceless what s worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk band to move in upstairs adding insult to injury the band tony coca cola and the roosters play the grand street stomp a guitar riff that has a great driving force this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of the 1970 s conventions are borrowed from polanski s repulsion and cassaveetes shadows the handheld mingling with the street people of the period shows how filthy nyc was at the time lots of fun driller killer was meant to be listened to loud	positive

in terms of both format and style rent despite its superficially modernist tendencies has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition yet it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters in more traditional musicals the long stretches of spoken exposition between song and dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable flesh and blood human beings this is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like phantom of the opera which seems a natural for this type of approach but with material like rent which is small in scale and intimate in scope the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience i know that this play \( and perhaps now even the movie \) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers rent practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism but to someone like myself coming cold to the work rent adds up to much less than the sum of its parts the story a modern day update of la boheme set in greenwich village starts on christmas eve 1989 and ends on christmas eve 1990 this was at the height of the aids epidemic and indeed many of the film s characters primarily gay men and former junkies are struggling with the disease \( aids being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story \) there s also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists \( one is tempted to call them deadbeats \) from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re developing a city block rent with its noble performance artists doing battle against the big bad corporate bullies feels less like a relic from the 80 s than one from the 60 s though intended to be the heroes of the piece the artists and bohemians often come across as na ve painfully self absorbed and annoyingly self righteous an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local atm machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend s name \( the heavily allegorical angel \) as the password \( this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man \) anything s better than actually working i suppose and becoming a tool of corporate america when one of the men finally takes a dreaded job \( a mere sinecure i might add \) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes \( horrors \) he acts as if he is selling his soul to satan and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest to god paycheck i wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them with the exception of newcomer rosario dawson the filmmakers have retained most of the original broadway cast members for the movie and even though their acting isn t all that impressive some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing in his direction chris columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we re watching despite the constantly tracking sometimes even spinning camera he has chosen to employ the film still feels stagy over stylized and artificial in almost every scene as to the libretto by the late jonathon larsen only one tune strikes me as truly memorable while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling one of the problems too with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian pedestrian and prosaic when they aren t pseudo intellectual drivel on the order of the opposite of war isn t peace it s creation that they become unintentionally funny when set to music it s not for nothing that the sharks and the jets didn t actually sing out most of their confrontations there are admittedly some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings i have ever seen in a motion picture in that one crucial moment the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it i don t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for rent \( or of its many devoted followers \) but it s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people especially sensitive artists should be allowed to live on other people s properties for free	negative
this film starts with an event based on a true crime a talk radio show host in denver was killed by an american nazi \( this event inspired the talk radio play and film \) this film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region no mention of their economic status are they losing dollars and population small businesses etc instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him this seems too exaggerated to believe federal agents are aware of this but don t want to act yet their agent is sent back to get more information there are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas the film doesn t explain what created them it shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions no real names of course the federal agent meets to report to her higher ups then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities \( based on real events \) most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group \( the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s \) this federal agency doesn t interfere because they want more information on their aims \( and their leaders \) more terrorism is planned dynamiting a courthouse attacking a power station etc the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day kathy finds a secret list of friends this is quickly copied with a camera the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them gary meets with the leader \( who arrives in a helicopter \) and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator is kathy being served up as a sacrifice gary and kathy travel to chicago where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy \( another lee harvey oswald \) a second lone gunman shoots the politician in front of a building gary fails to shoot and won t ever try this again costa gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film z a few years later his film about rebels in south america was popular his later films have seemed mediocre a better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does better pacing could help the threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film \( e g timothy mcveigh \) those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts a better film today would show the bad results from nafta and free trade in harming most americans economically but hollywood would never allow a film about this war on the middle class the word nafta in greek and arabic refers to petroleum nafta is a symbol for the policies designed for big oil it is like george w bush calling his policy operation iraqi liberation	negative
i watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless i really dont know what to think about the whole presentation the presence of chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not if what they claim about corporations is true then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another i ll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide i had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4 the material is more plausible than otherwise	positive

this movie while not a bomb or a turkey has a couple of serious flaws one is the casting ted wass has lots of credits to his name according to imdb but what a wimpy character less uninteresting washout he is was blake going for a harold lloyd lookalike he got one but there s nothing else to recommend him he looks like a clark kent without the superman suit underneath the other flaw is the length even the opening credits \( using a defreiling patie ripoff style \) go on forever but the slapstick which is masterful as always \( blake having been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies especially those of laurel hardy \) my god does he stretch things out here the cameos are the saving grace especially roger moore s his vocal impersonation of clousseau is perfect why didn t he dub the voice for clousseau in the concurrently filmed trail of the pink panther whoever did that voiceover sounded like sellers on helium it s sad to see our icons age especially burt kwouk who looks and sounds awfully tired david niven looks as close to death as he actually was rich little s uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done subtle and convincing herbert lom s dreyfuss got bigger and more ridiculous in each successive film and harvey korman s prof balls is delightful the entire scene in his shop is a stitch no there will never be another sellers \( and i have no intention of seeing the new film with steve martin \) but blake could have done better with his stopgaps	negative

when we watched this remake of brian s song it was not by design we had requested the 1971 version from netflix but the dvd was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake but instead of sending it back again we thought what the hec let s give it a chance while we didn t expect it to live up to the beloved original nothing could prepare us for how god awful it was so when we saw all the stars given to this remake we were utterly mystified other than mekhi phifer s performance which was pretty good it was a joke sean s maher s brian piccolo was a caricature cartoony and over the top obnoxious maybe they had intended to cast jim carrey in the role but he was busy instead they got maher to do a jim carrey impersonation james caan portrayed piccolo as this outgoing wise cracking guy but he was human and believable not a clown and those football scenes they looked ridiculous at least in the original they used real game footage which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium not at a high school or some sound stage even though the original was a tv movie the performances scenarios and dialog were well done believable touching heartwrenching if you watch it now is it dated of course but there s nothing wrong with that it is current to the time it depicts but this remake reminds us of a very bad melodramatic after school special really it was so bad i can t find adequate words to describe it	negative

not very familiar with noam chomsky s work but i have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments this film is proof of those arguments noam chomsky has facts refers to original sources provides context and analysis and leaves you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well research argument this film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world america s invasion of iraq the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9 11 and other topics are rich and insightful this film provides a nice balance on chomsky by giving us some insight into him which is interesting i find him more fascinating now than i did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material this film gives those new to noam chomsky s books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so after watching this film i went out and read 9 11 and his latest book while good the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner	positive

incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies	negative

don t expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity if you do you are in for a fall both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining this one has no such pretensions it is merely boring the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town s folk out of their claims they do this through intimidation and violence when a couple of friends get hold of a claim they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys to do this they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction they yell they fight they wrestle they shoot and then they do it some more its not very exciting cinema this production is made worse by the dvd i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair the dvd however is of such low quality that who could really tell the edges are clipped off the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it it was not worth the effort spaghetti westerns can be fun this one however needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn	negative
the animation excellent the characters excellent the premise excellent laugh lines plenty of them and well executed this is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on the problem is as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future for kids they don t see a lesson in putting your past to rest they see if you don t like something put it to rest as is r i p dead after the crotchety old man \( doesn t every haunted house need one to heighten the tension \) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off \( again \) also shame on the producers of this movie a kids movie there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour \( babysitter getting it on with boyfriend boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids etc \) it is just not necessary to tell this story i wouldn t let any relative of mine under 14 see this otherwise excellent flick	negative

that you simply have to see mrs miniver being one a little known film dealing with a fictitious german invasion to a sweet english village went the day well and this film why so because all 3 were made at the start of the war \( early 40 s \) when england stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt hitler and aggresive facism invasion fears were rife the war effort looked hopeless at times as in europe hitler opposing country after country fell to the german aggressors \( not to mention the rampage going on in africa at the hands of rommel aided by the italian forces under mussolini s instruction \) england s small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day it was quite possibly the darkest of times in english history and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect with realistic perfection in which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of british life for a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made \( 1942 \) and i guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely coward s plan an absolute gem and a must see i weep every time i watch it	positive
i always love it when prevention release another workout because i get bored easy and i like to mix workouts up i ve loved all of the other prevention workouts and knew i d love this too chris freytag leads again and does another superb job there are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts the dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want that s a big plus so you don t get bored or pushed for time you can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc if for example you pick that you need to lose weight there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already that is so helpful the moves are all basic no frills moves but they are effective the first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder the body parts are all the ones you want to workout arms butt abs and thighs all you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy this is so easy to do due to the programming so there really is no excuse for not working out this can be done by practically anyone i also love how the other two girls exercising as well aren t the kinds that yell and shout etc they are as professional as chris	positive
if you re looking to hear robert johnson s songs you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible as this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years i m not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs and talk about his life that s all we have now and of course the covers do not outdo him that would be impossible but there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of robert johnson and the world he lived in the discussion with a former classmate is touching and the covers of his songs by those who knew him \( robert lockwood jr honeyboy edwards \) and by some of the new delta blues talent such as guy davis roy rogers and especially alvin youngblood heart blew me away gov t mule and sonny landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work the major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n roll hall of fame gathering and also bob weir s performance which is just plain bad all in all it is a good film and it s nice to actually be able to watch people play his music as we will never be able to see the real thing	positive
for those not aware pumpkinhead 2 is \( supposedly \) the 1994 sequel to 1988 s timeless monster classic pumpkinhead the original was darkly creepy superbly constructed in it s story and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific butchers the story and basically uses the name and a simliar creature suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant sequel it s like a group of writers saw a picture of pumpkinhead on the internet read his name \( and that s all they read \) and decided to make their own movie as for the plot \( if anyone cares \) a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings i ll admit if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie this would ve been worth two or three stars as a so bad it s good b flick but the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it if you haven t seen 1988 s pumpkinhead rent it or buy it it s a horror masterpiece \( especially compared to this \) with so much going for it but avoid this sequel at all costs i hate to put down any product but i feel that this one deserves it	negative

screenwriter charlie kaufman s reality bending work has become such a hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts he dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories directed by michel gondry this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception as kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one s memory at the same time gondry and kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky the labyrinth plot focuses on shy taciturn joel barish who is swept off his feet by the raucous unstable clementine much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight he discovers that clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called lacuna headed by the benevolent dr mierzwiak a renowned leader in his field of memory erasure mierzwiak treats the heartbroken joel to the same procedure as clementine s however joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of clementine the surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from joel s plight it helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued jim carrey as the depressed joel this is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate displaying no trace of her corseted britishness as the bedraggled free spirit clementine kate winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness tom wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful mierzwiak while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by kirsten dunst mark ruffalo and elijah wood all three are fine with dunst particularly affecting toward the end the looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer ellen kuras production designer dan leigh and editor valdis oskarsdottir all combining to bring much needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes the only fly in the ointment is jon brion s overly intrusive music the 2004 dvd has several extras the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by gondry and kaufman which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns there are two featurettes a standard ten minute making of short and a fifteen minute conversation with gondry and carrey that borders on banal seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included as well as a creative music video of the polyphonic spree s night and day and a faux commercial for lacuna	positive
children of the corn ii terence knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage the special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst the acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production the gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to holly upstairs acting school to write such junk and to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me	negative
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio	negative

you know the feeling that feeling of oh my gosh how did i ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end well that s what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film unfortunately because of its all star cast although this wouldn t be the first time in movie history where an all star cast is wasted aside from an interesting peek into the world of yale s secret skull and bones society a delightful cameo by joe pesci and a few too cute by half zingers this movie has little or nothing to offer it doesn t keep one s attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on you realize that you don t even care about the characters matt damon s skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry especially with the beautiful angelina jolie and he is laughably miscast as a father in fairness however with the script he s been given it s hard to see how damon could have done much better the pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends a huge disappoinment especially since director deniro is such a talented actor skip it	negative

i actually saw this movie when it first came out and was so blown away by robert downey jr s performance \( he was just starting out on his illustrious if self destructive career \) that i didn t notice much else about the movie certainly not jami gertz or andrew mccarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it s possible to have on the big screen \( the adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids so there is no real dramatic interest there we have only the kids and their interactions with drugs the party scene and each other \) seeing it again 25 years later well downey s performance still holds up but the rest of the movie is less than zero \( sorry \) the director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes \( unintentionally hilarious in their excesses \) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do and they never develop into anyone we care about the final scene with mccarthy and gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery has no emotional payoff whatever mccarthy says come with me to the east coast gertz responds yes i ll go with you and the viewer says thank god that means the movie s over finally james spader doesn t play a real character either but as other reviewers have noted he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy glad to see he s still getting work in a fairly interesting role on boston legal	negative
the french title of this film is in extremis \( though translated as to the extreme \) and means in desperate circumstances especially at the point of death rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing gives the cinematic effort more poignancy this is a tale of the impact of family loss of parents dissolution of the core unit has on us all in this story we are asked to exam the in extremis state of such trauma thomas \( s bastien roch \) is a hedonist a handsome young man whose parents died in an alpine accident and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity he lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son gr goire \( j r my sanguinetti \) whom he loves as a son when the mother accidentally dies gr goire wants thomas to be his guardian thomas lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves gr goire by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent even with the aid of his prostitute sister anne \( julie depardieu \) he is unable to keep the disappointed gr goire from being sent to a prison like orphanage thomas finds solace from his lover vincent \( aur lien wiik \) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for gr goire eventually thomas devotion to gr goire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy s escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in ibiza his deceased parents owned the story has a bizarre but touching ending which comes totally unexpectedly and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film director writer etienne faure \( prisonnier and la recherche de tadzio which is included on this cd and traces the life of the actor bj rn andresen who played tadzio in the film death in venice \) directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks fantasies graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music but given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family genetic and extended and therein is the power of the story this is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place in french with english subtitles grady harp may 05	positive

my husband and i are both history and literature buffs so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to dvd we aren t typically hard people to please but this film was one of the most boring movies that i ve seen to date it s not that i don t appreciate artistic visually stimulating movies that have a point perhaps assuming we all knew the story already the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass water trees and more trees apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever \( though i will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there \) this movie represents revisionist history at its worst here we are presented with an idyllic practically un fallen and un corrupted view of the noble savage juxtaposed against the muddy disgusting conniving white man perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some native american life like scalping or the less than environmentally friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs it s fair to say as the post colonial talk goes that native americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years but by shifting to the other extreme don t we fall prey to the same false stereotyping just going the opposite direction	negative
the overwhelming impression i get from this film is wow these guys are alive they are not just making their way through a boring life they re out there doing interesting things doing cool stuff having adventures generally living their lives to the fullest the they that i refer to includes just about everybody in the movie from paul pena to the guys travelling with him to richard feynman to the tuvans that paul meets and befriends the documentary gets hazy in spots \( i m still not sure of some of the tuvan inter relationships \) but does a good job of establishing empathy with pena a blind man relying on others in a place far from home the dvd extras are o k the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie i did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but i suppose you could get more factual info technical details on the commentary	positive

i do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of buffy the vampire slayer as scaling operatic heights culminating with the glorious aria of becoming part 2 which i still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television i have ever seen in my life i have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life so i believe i can make a pretty convincing case we witnesses the potential of this series in season 1 when creator joss whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious angel was really a vampire who just happened to have a soul and loved the slayer until half way through the abbreviated first season in season 2 we find out just how far true love can go wrong love continues to be a very painful thing for the scooby gang as cordelia \( some assembly required \) xander \( inca mummy girl \) and joyce \( ted \) find out then again prospects look much better for willow \( phases \) although we never really do take the cordelia xander romance \( go fish \) to be anything more than a cosmic joke which does offer up the delightfully twisted bewitched bothered and bewildered as the exception that proves the rule \( footnote buffy spends most of the episode as the buffy rat because sarah michelle gellar was hosting snl that week \) of the off arc stories halloween and ted are clearly the best of the bunch but when it comes to romance buffy and angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions it is clear in the season premier episode when she was bad that things are different when buffy dances seductively with xander taunting him with her sexuality the ante has been upped considerably the pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 \( of 22 \) surprise when buffy unknowingly undoes angel s curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him why the gypsies put in the faustian \( in the goethe sense \) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive when angelus brutally slays jenny calendar in passion leaving her body in a grotesque display for giles to discover in his bed \( while opera music soars in the background \) it is the symbolic hellmouth of the show opening up the audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get only the worst is yet to come giles s anger buys him one shot at angelus but buffy has to rescue him they turn on each other in anger and buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other s arms buffy tells him i can t do this alone but this proves to be most ironically incorrect clearly whedon constructs each season around two half season story arcs the first half of season 2 heralds the arrival of spike and dru and the quick departure of the annoying one of course now we look back and are amazed at what james marsters has done with the role of spike but at this point it is juliet landau s ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side whedon brings the first half to a climax in what s my line the show s first two parter where we are introduced to kendra the vampire slayer it seems buffy s brief moment of death at the hands of the master in prophecy girl has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point but with the return of angelus everything changes spike and drusilla are trying to reassemble the judge a grotesque who cannot be killed by any weapon forged then everybody learns the truth about not only angel s transformation but also jenny s betrayal thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between angel and his former allies which culminates in the two parts of becoming both parts of becoming are written and directed by whedon and represent the apex of his work on the series when angeleus opens the portal to hell only his blood can close it but things are not going to be that easy for buffy the dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence \( with swords \) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by sarah michelle gellar s slow dissolve into tears while the haunting sarah mclachlan song full of grace is played joss whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series it is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season becoming is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up the original theatrical film was a teaser the first season on television was an appetizer but the second season of buffy the vampire slayer was epic and once you see this whether again or for the first time you are not going to want to stop here it was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the season 2 dvd collection especially since we expect more goodies from whedon and crew especially given the high quality of the watchers guide the show s official companion volumes there was a lot of thought put into this show which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated	positive

i loved this movie it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it this did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a tv show that was made into a movie	positive
i rented this movie for about six dollars and i have to say even that was a waste of money i thought this movie was incredibly over acted boring and hard on the eyes the thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did they were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial for the superficial people out there i wouldn t watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won t get it when i found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible i have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment	negative
argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by lumiere after hitchcock and ray leone and fuller argento is the last true auteur to make genre films visually a film like profondo rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed objects and people alike take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker cinema is not an answer but a question and argento is the answer to eisenstein s theory of film as violence violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them a murder a painting a mother a son a mirror all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing the mystery of cinema the questions are resolved	positive
i love the firm workouts and i love the instructor allie so i was so excited to try this new workout i was unfortunately extremely disappointed this workout was not complicated but it also wasn t much of a workout i didn t get my heart rate up at all and didn t break a sweat some of the moves are just not very good and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying the disco part was my favorite but overall this is a workout that i can honestly say i would rather have the money then the workout i will keep it and periodically do it on a very light day or in addition to another workout but that s just because i have it i ve tried a couple other of the new firm workouts that are more worth the money this one i am sad to say is not	negative
oliver stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a historian platoon and born on the fourth of july were great films but jfk though brilliantly made was a sign that something was off about stone s mental processes natural born killers could have been a scathing indictment of our media s obsession with violence and decadence but instead it s just exhibit a in the indictment wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize	negative

is anyone else having issues with these discs when you first place the discs in the player it skips over the main menus then the menu button will only start and stop the episode selected but it will not return you to the main menu there is no spanish or portuguese dubbed audio on the discs \( despite what the menus and packaging claim \) and the episodes automatically play with spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned off the only way to avoid this is to choose other subtitles with the remote this appears to be an authoring issue as i am using a two year old sony dream system dvd player and have not had these issues with previous seasons i m exchanging my discs immediately but i have a feeling they might all be bad anyone else hear about these issues	negative
i love david cross s comedy i love his stand up i love mr show but this dvd is not kinda boring it is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen there may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd there is no accounting for taste but 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released	negative
i will be utterly honest i don t buy music cds anymore with so many bands hitting the streets faster than i can imagine i honestly cannot keep up with them all music begins to sound the same corporations seem to have their pre determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion those like the simpsons backstreet boys and even hip hop artists are blending together to sound uniform unoriginal and overly drab i had nearly lost my faith in music retreating to some of my older music like dmb counting crows and travis but then i found the suns stumbling around the internet i discovered shockingly one of the videos to their album called romantic death it was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that i have seen in quite some time then it hit me i couldn t get this song out of my mind throughout the whole day i had the beat the lyrics and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind and i had only heard it once like a drug i needed more when i returned home that evening i found the song again and couldn t stop listening to it for the first time in a long time i had found a new band then i bought this album knowing nothing about the band except for the romantic death song i put this in my dvd player and continued to be impressed their videos are just as smart as their music their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk rock and even hard edge their lyrics seem well considered smart and a voice to a new generation my favorites of the album are must be you romantic death \( parental guidance is suggested \) lost at home rockstop we tried in fact every time i listen to this album i find a new song to explore a new song to jam to on the way to work a new song to enjoy for those skeptical of this band i suggest this album to test your tastes not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other cds which allow friends and family to explore this band but also all of their energetic original videos that will never see the light of day on mtv but can be watched from the leisure of your dvd player the sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry if the rockstops it ll be all my fault grade out of	positive
hard to believe it took me until now \( february 2007 \) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award deserving back in the early 80 s i loved this movie it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting especially tony montana a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is \( over 2 hours \) everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime it won t disappoint the ending gave me goosebumps it was that good and intense watch it now	positive

i love this old documentary capt clark gable does an excellent job narrating it the color footage is a rare treat and it gives an excellent insight into the day to day lives of those from the greatest generation it is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in wwii and we need to remember their service and sacrifices they fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in iraq or afghanistan plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn t have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones we need to remember them as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone but their legacy remains and it is films like this one that preserves it	positive

i am a fan of dbz i am a fan of goten i think hercule is funny and i think 18 is hot yet this movie sucked it was missing what makes dbz so great lots of action and a great plot broly is overused and this completely ruins him like most dbz movies it doesn t fit into the timeline if we worked it in then goten and trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the fusion technique had this movie taken place after then the fight would be a lot more interesting in short if you want to see every dbz movie then rent it if you insist on collecting the whole series wait until movie collection 4 comes out	negative

asks the interviewer what place would you give shoot the piano player in relation to your other films answers director fran ois truffaut no place simply the second film i made considering his first feature film was the four hundred blows and his third was jules et jim truffaut s matter of factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile shoot the piano player is worth smiles too it s a clever film playful at times even funny more than anything however it defies categorization the movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy suspense and inevitability tragedy and love and gangsters girl friends and violence it s the story of charlie koller \( charles aznavour \) a piano player in a paris dive who used to be eduoard saroyan a famous pianist whose wife committed suicide truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants he can t go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing he thinks about what he should do but can t do it and then circumstances take over charlie thanks to his brothers finds himself in a gangland underworld where double crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow some say shoot the piano player is an homage to american gangster films perhaps it is but i challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie the film is original funny moving and sad it s the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about all i know is that i was moved by charlie we leave him where we met him playing piano in a paris dive charles aznavour a diminutive man with a hangdog look plays charlie perfectly aznavour is probably better known in the u s as a singer but in france he s seen as both an actor and a singer he s a minimalist he says about himself charlie thinks too much and does too little aznavour lets us see into charlie s soul with few words it s a marvelous performance that left me saddened by charlie but liking him the criterion dvd transfer is first rate criterion gives us two discs the first has the movie and a commentary track the second disc contains interviews by aznavour and marie dubois who played charlie s girlfriend lena plus excerpts from documentaries featuring truffaut and other extras the criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and truffaut	positive

this was so messy and mr dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion yuk my partner and i were disgusted he and his deceased friend photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag degenerates for sure too damn bad for your buddy it was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring bold and challenging as some of herzogs past films we have been fans for 20 years looks like he did it for the money and dorrington rode herzogs coatails in a way geez i had just watched march of the penguins and wings of migration and those are truly documentaries made by film experts the babbling and rambling on in the white diamond made me pity herzog he did it for the maybe dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way i suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts hey dorrington who cares about you herzog get out of california before you rot	negative

whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around \( few of them seem to have jobs \) and party all day the main character \( sid \) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college \( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism \) the film appeals to naive youth	negative

long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual song and dance i have come to believe that the old ways were in many cases the superior mode of transmission mere words could never convey the multi faceted beauty wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance this point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of holo mai pele holo mai pele is an exciting and exotic multi media production that i found absoultely engrossing the director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio the on stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting hawaiian landscape the on stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions lava flows and lush tropical rainforests all of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano goddess pele and her battle with her youngest sister hi iaka the narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance this dvd serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the hawaiian spirit of aloha truly a sacred visual document to be treasured	positive
this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played eight women is the story of well eight women who are trapped by a snowstorm all 5 inches of it the man of the house has been murdered in the night young and old black and white of different classes the women must try to determine who the killer is eight women is also a movie about secrets of which everyone seems to have several the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france yet the first 2 3 of the film is tolerable funny and even a bit interesting the characters are self interested and fun there s dotty old grandma a prissy hysterical virgin aunt the dead man s vampish sister and coltish young maid two daughters a somber yet elegant wife \( catherine deneuve \) and a black cook plenty of class and age tension to make three movies did i mention the music every twenty minutes or so one of the characters breaks into song these are always those stereotypical french songs full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime that are tedious to american ears and bizarre while one character sings the rest do slow little dances strange by the 2 3 mark i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars but soon the plot line spun out of control getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience	negative

afi finally release a live dvd and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now it is very impressive it does lack older more hardcore punk tracks but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the band it is now each album progresses towards more epic scales and songs balance beauty with power i heard a voice captures this on film and the fan gets to witness afi at their most grandiose watching vocalist davey havok sing god called in sick today while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime the masterful command of theatrics from each member especially havok creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate the setlist itself is perfectly put together with the only gripe being the exclusion of kiss and control the rest of the songs display all facets of afi from the fast paced dancing through sunday \( which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist jade puget \) kill caustic death of seasons totalimmortal and a single second \( the last of which features a guest appearance by nick 13 of tiger army \) to the slower paced this time imperfect and endlessly she said as well as all of their recent singles and a few more cuts from their latest releases decemberunderground and sing the sorrow extras are geared towards the fans with despair faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the decemberunderground release as well as a poster each band member has their moments to shine and are all very capable and talented muscians bassist hunter burgan and drummer adam carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals as puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery in this genre over the instrument this is all built up to allow havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you the quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic unlike other live dvd s where the concert is edited to the point of a music video i heard a voice has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd but also add to the overall effect of the performance the sound is very clear and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix this is overall a very stellar production and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band as well as new fans and casual fans should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy	positive
while it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers this history of rock simply doesn t jell as a whole by trying to explain the evolution of the music the pleasure gets lost along the way if you are a rock connaisseur you won t learn many new things if you watch this what you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field \( ex motown or british invasion \) as it is it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like emerson lake and palmer and king crimson among others it costs me 80 dollars \( canadian money \) for this 5 dvd set which is too much for what it s worth rent it and enjoy the clips	positive
michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through the big one i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i didn t know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick this is not one of his better films	negative
this a mystery triller starring tom berenger gretta scacchi corbin bernsen joanne whalley kilmer and bob hoskins it s the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically crashing all the way she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm while he amazingly lives at first leaving him in a coma but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia later after being nursed back to health and falling in love with his wife all over again he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller but comes predictable fast i knew the key mysteries almost immediately and i m sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law order episodes will agree eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again	negative
this dvd showcases a somewhat new \( as of the 2001 recording \) sound for sade with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music however sade s voice adapts beautifully and she is one of those singers who just doesn t need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous her buttery chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this dvd after a few years of owning this dvd i still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing sound and lights on this dvd i highly recommend it to add to your chill out collection no longer the jazzy sade of yesteryear the versatility of songs on this long \( almost 2 hours \) dvd will keep you grooving for hours	positive

war exposed some violence simmering within one gulf war veteran christian bale is electrifying as jim a tough minded ex ranger whose brutal nature didn t subside after his return home to la they say war changes a man this might be evident here but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed the demons inside of jim along with his buddy mike \( freddy rodriguez \) the two tear through the town bingeing on drugs and alcohol their is no deep plot here just a couple of ruffians going around town looking for jobs but it is a great character study watching jim self destruct bale is great in this type of role like he was in american psycho or the machinist i liked this movie much more than training day which this director previously wrote the screenplay for	positive
this comment may contain spoilers anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it i ve encountered enough people over the course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories this has been satirized on the simpsons which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness anyone who has read the book its based on the incredible i am legend by richard matheson knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise and even that is not followed too closely all of the criticisms of the omega man are valid it is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably ludicrously cheesy the villains who should have been more terrifying than even romero s zombies are just crazed albino hippie luddites and the last half of the film once chuck hooks up with rosalind cash and the kiddies is really a let down but the scenes that open the film of heston hefting a cool looking machine gun while decked out in austin powers style finery \( \) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch this was the second movie after 1959 s the world the flesh and the devil to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash after years of seeing this on tv a guaranteed late september or early october event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my pacific northwest childhood in the old dark ages before cable tv and the videocassette revolution its nice to see this movie on dvd with a beautiful widescreen transfer it looks and sounds great as a child i always liked the music particularly the surprise party theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance it rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory	positive

they just don t have movies like this anymore this is not a movie that makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen this is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past charlie sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war this seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie he finds out alright keith david plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role he cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked the supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here overall this is my favorite movie of all time it has stood the test of time and never fails when i want to see a good movie i just have the old special edition not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice it has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film there is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when i saw this i was mroe than glad i got the special edition you would nto believe what the actors went through it is a great making of	positive
when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each husband killing wife after wife a man who enjoys murder and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it if you don t heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny \( i wouldn t take it for free \)	negative

this is a film like none other you have ever seen and as such you ll either love it or hate it from the reviews posted on amazon i ve come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don t have the intelligence to have understood a word of it this film is not literal learn to think about what you are watching to interpret archetypes symbolism and metaphor a clue the lady character is named story now why might that be and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world and what precisely does the wolf like scrunt represent and why are there three of those monkeys this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world if you aren t an artist you probably won t get it at all and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says and love every beautiful unique and visionary second of it magical	positive
that is what this film meant to me looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by so sweet so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there this film is a poem to paris and the passing of youth with the hope of recapturing that one love which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind always present always remembered always desired the two lovers meet seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier they see how much they meant to eachother how much they still could like two pieces of a puzzle that fit this is a genuinely beautiful film more mature than the last one much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic it opened that sense of mystery that i have known in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy julie delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages she has become a sad person stalled in relationships though she is living up to her ideals ethan hawke is struggling to grow with his success in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly their relationship so brief rings totally true in its humor commitment and occasional awkwardness perhaps this is sentimental but i think i have known love like this it is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago some people simply pierce thru to the heart earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become it is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex \( well maybe not too far beyond \) highest recommendation this succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time with an entire history implied behind it like the greatest art and i do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted which is also so very much like real life	positive

eddie and rose are meant to be in nicole savoca s dogfight this is a warm and wonderful movie those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can it s sad that so few people have heard of or seen dogfight how a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me many others have synopsized the story so i wont be repetitive i will say that this movie s genius is in its acting river phoenix and lili taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends and it shows in scene after scene river gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse absurdly young jarhead eddie about to ship out to vietnam his coming of age is the narrative behind this movie while rose s idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the dogfight make her character angelic the poignancy of the closing scene in which eddie embraces rose in tears after having lost his three best friends during the vietnam war will stay with you for a long time dogfight is a unique and touching film it harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as romantic by hollywood today	positive

incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies	negative
if you are looking for something shocking don t bother with this movie rape scene why doesn t she run why doesn t she fight how come there s all this blood on her all of a sudden where did that come from stupid revenge scenes first of all i wasn t upset enough to thirst for revenge second of all the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene what you ve basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake scene for scene including every gratuitous moment and it would get made it would show in theaters and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying go rent irreversible it s much better at this sort of thing	negative

during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was spot on and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood it s not that doom is really a bad movie sure it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters it s just a normal monster shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense and that s it i m sure the movie would ve been big had it been released 10 years ago todays generation is probably sick of go nowhere do nothing action films such as doom okay so it does go somewhere but the film isn t really designed to build to an awe inspiring creative story doom is the kind of movie you don t really want to seek out you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90 minute action fix so you rent the movie watch it and then forget about it the next morning of course i m sure you don t forget to rewind the tape because that s impolite the rock never should have left wrestling it was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans \( and the rock means millions \) really miss him come back home rock please	negative
this film had a powerful effect on me 95 of the people i know don t read books i met a millionaire not long ago who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life lady di was reported never to have read anything except perhaps fashion mags my children hardly read and their husbands and wives certainly don t my ex wife never read anything her father thought ulysses was a dirty book i stopped watching television in 1980 and i own 10 000 books but not fahrenheit 451 which i d read about 45 years ago this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury s text but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear and with a very solid punch to the plexus the manner in which it is written played and directed added to its impact this world of sleep walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us the style was strange but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal people live and work like automated morons they can t think for themselves and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied they can t conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind in fact present them with an idea or attempt to initiate a discussion and they ll often become angry some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts ludicrous suggestions remake it with mad mel gibson have infantile spielberg direct it bulk it out with computerised sfx these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub humans which the film targets and many of them seem unable to understand their own language let alone write it or spell it this is a memorable film for those whose memories still function unlike the captain of the firemen	positive

if you follow my reviews you know that i felt the version of jack the ripper with michael caine as inspector fred abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece not only was michael caine phenomenal in the role but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we don t know and never will while i respect this version with johnny depp it is more horror oriented \( michael caine s version was more historical \) onto the subject at hand some of you may know jack s 5 victims \( mary anne nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride kathy eadows and mary jane kelly \) well they seem to have a close friendship and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret \( in the michael caine version the 5 victims knew each other but they were just associates \) well of course jack the ripper comes into play one scene is very well done in that while we don t see his face we do see some disturbing pictures and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine in comes depp \( inspector fred abberline \) it is interesting that while the older michael caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role johnny depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday but maybe depp didn t want to just imitate caine one thing i had a problem with was that while caine had some trouble with his superiors depp s trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion \( without giving the story away his superiors must have known things that they didn t tell depp at least caine s superiors carried some reason on their side \) you ll probably notice that depp finds things out much quicker than caine did \( probably because caine s version was 4 hours while depp s is only 2 \) while caine was involved with an artist depp becomes involved with mary jane kelly gradually depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle like caine did in his version depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer \( of course depp does not know he is talking to the killer \) well another problem here is that in the caine version we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with caine we never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to depp \( jack the ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the caine version \) i will admit that the scenery is well done the elements of horror are there and depp did a good job of not just imitating michael caine and depp s sergeant godley does offer some entertainment but if you saw the michael caine version you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy if on the other hand you don t mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history you ll probably find it a respectable horror movie side note johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he s going to die anyday well in reality fred abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped jack the ripper	positive

the economy austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers lang a master of the german expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies it was a shocking idea for its time based on the real life killer peter kurten headlined as the vampire of d sseldorf m is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes \( often chewing candy \) who is a pathological child killer unable to control his urge for killing the film embodies several lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity for the killer is clearly mentally sick he cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man early in the film the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from in the hall of the mountain king this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the sound track told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sight the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since casablanca the maltese falcon and the mask of dimitrios when the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horror with powerful visuals lang s motion picture is lorre s first film his performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion lorre is the archetypal outsider outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal he had only twelve lines of dialog in the most famous of all about a pathological killer alfred hitchcock s psycho anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of m is subtle a child s balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed the audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight	positive

for a plot synopsis please read the amazon review i wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film as a longtime fan of both sam raimi \( of the evil dead series \) and bill paxton \( aliens twister \) i went to see this on opening night not many people can claim this i m sure because it was and is such a small film that received next to no marketing for shame this film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including blood simple and fargo both made by the cohen brothers film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers so i won t bother to get into that should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them i suggest you stop reading and immediately rent a simple plan if not keep reading and i will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant and why i hope you will take a look at it a simple plan is at its core about four people and underneath all the plot devices and twists it s about how they relate to one another notice i did t say characters because this film doesn t have actors simply delivering dialogue it s about people you get to know understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas sure finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device but the heart of this film is much simpler than that it s about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it and being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process that s what gives this film such depth you watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash and in the end it falls apart for two reasons the details and the human factor they say the devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime as for the human factor where greed is concerned people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person s greed while are unable satisfy their own in many respects this film is almost an homage to blood simple and fargo but in many ways i think it is superior i often draw the comparison by a scene which is both a simple plan and blood simple where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of and even afterwards after the emotional toll the has been taken once one evil act is committed another is sure to follow it s so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera frantically going over the details in their mind all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute bill paxton does this better than anyone he is such a likable man \( both in the film and in life \) that you can t help but feel sorry for the mess he has created his entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife that may make them all sound malicious but really the opposite is actually true they re all normal folks like we ve all seen a hundred times and in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in after all were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss what would you do but then again nothing is ever that simple	positive

even though i am not a streisand fan i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand s character making her attractive no irresistible to the main male character the problem is she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover somebody \( probably streisand \) thinks that highlighted hair a tight black cocktail dress and a baggy lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress casual clothes and everyday looks are disgusting baaaaaamp \( that s the fallacy alarm going off men in my experience don t care much about clothes and makeup \) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character s losing weight by riding an exercise bike but she looked exactly the same afterward no detectable weight difference yet truly the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand discussing her baby and early childhood photos with her mother \( played by lauren bacall \) blubbers wazz i a pretty baby wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee in that one scene streisand s neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed the whole movie is about this issue and it s amazing that an entire cast crew and production company would devote themselves to b s s emotional issues like that i really think that the funny girl phenomenon somehow ruined streisand s thought processes the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light years away from the stereotyped northern european beauty standard of the time \( think grace kelly think ingrid bergman \) i recall reading about how her glowing complexion thick hair and good figure \( as well as her energy and voice \) carried her through despite her looks long nose large lips slanted eyes myself i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar but she certainly doesn t look like grace kelly so why can t she accept this the majority of us women whatever our race color or bone structure learn to live with and love who we are at least i hope we do this movie is not about that this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable maybe i should ve given it only one star	negative
while some critics can argue with dan brown s research and reasoning on certain historical points one thing these da vinci debunking presentations will never be able to refute is this the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity primarily by the catholic church and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago 1969 nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still quite frankly shocking and debasing sorry but upon this rock of male dominancy was built the church thank you again dan brown by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations obscurations and lies these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources worth trillions through guilt control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus actual relationship with the women in his life or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men s club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship to answer these questions some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self interest or from spiritual corruption the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view lord only knows what plunder they contain	negative

i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i don t know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one hasn t seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i wasn t shocked disturbed or upset just bored	negative
this could have been an excellent documentary but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly this is particularly true in the way it depicts sparta as being some kind of womyn s power state which is absurd somewhat comically the narrator enhances the story of sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus she tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi sexuality hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a feminist wonderland but that s exactly what is implied i don t know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother yeah right unless of course husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful to many counter culturalists history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program unfortunately that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work as for bettany hughes i agree that she is quite attractive but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing sparta i ll take victor davis hanson any day over her i recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians	negative
this dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of christianity it discusses an alternate viewpoint \( as dan brown reminds us the winners write the history books \) this dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with esp the idea of god as male and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership this dvd includes interviews with dan burstein henry lincoln martin lunn lynn picknett clive prince dr karen ralls dr james robinson and margaret starbird i particularly liked margaret starbird s interviews she describes how when she first read holy blood holy grail she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal catholic but afterward she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research mary magdalene and write the woman with the alabaster jar she comes across as very rational sensible and even heroic it takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority i thought dan burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of jewish people during the time jesus lived i think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life that doesn t mean it is necessarily the truth to be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live	positive

i ll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 dvds ago and it continues with this volume as for the episodes themselves they were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs everything comes to a head and resolves looking back on the four episodes the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in japan this was not enough for a point deduction at the end of the day anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons you will not be disappointed	positive

compared to argento i must say that mario bava is for me entirely overrated he might be a pioneer but as a stylist he is sadly lacking his seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry even if you like horror films argento fans seeking out shock on the strength of daria nicolodi s starring role music by two members of goblin \( under the nom de plume a libra \) and srgento s supposed giallio based debt to bava should buy shock with caution although it is an authentic slice of eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror hollywood churns out it is still a fairly dreary dull repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances finally the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of jess franco s rubbish \( and that s saying something \) my dvd of the silly she killed in ecstasy filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better shame daria never made films without argento that are better than this	negative
this movie is a dud who d have thought that john wayne and the director of support your local sherrif would have joined forces for this stinker the characterization hints at being good but really its character actors doing what they do best being good support characters its a good thing to because the duke really just mailed this one in first what this movie does well ann margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show it is interesting that the bad guys chasing ann margaret and john wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end when you get to the end you learn why but it works well to keep them faceless the last 10 minutes is good top notch with a twister of an ending however what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right john wayne is absolutely uninspired he is just a cardboard version of himself a cranky mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character and when they do it seems very very clunky at least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long distance shots of people riding horses sometimes they ride over hills sometimes they ride through valleys we get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the rio grande \( the border with mexico \) fill in this time with some character development some dialogue anything the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie all in all it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so john wayne could have another movie in the theaters too bad a crack team of writers could have made it something special my suggestion get cowboys or either of the two rooster cogburn movies or support your local sherrif and see this actor and this director doing much better work	negative

i was never a diehard huey lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll if you re looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection this one is worth the price of admission i m not familiar with all the original members so just having huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as i remembered them it was memorable high energy performance one little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me about halfway through the show huey s shirt had a meltdown all of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour am i the only one that noticed this but it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had who could ask for more	positive
the concert in central park is not only the best of simon garfunkel s concerts it is one of the best of anyone s concerts in my estimation the crowd was really in to it and simon and garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music and the era it was written in i have owned the vcr tape for years and enjoyed it many times but the signal was beginning to fade so i was very pleased to see it released on dv	positive
the brood is the lightning in the bottle that director david cronenberg has never been able to duplicate while all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them the brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films it is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread there is a pervading coldness about it such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it you want to watch it with the lights on because you re very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights the film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick it warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place this is a very bloody film samantha eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her she is being treated by a creepy oliver reed \( in one of his better performances \) art hindle is her ex husband and he s worried about how she is treating their young daughter after a while that is the least of his worries as these horribly disfigured and \( what the hell are they \) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off samantha eggar i won t say more because part of the horror in a cronenberg film is the pseudo science that he get you to believe in whereas cronenberg s videodrome was weird but not terribly good the brood is one of the creepiest films i ve ever seen and a guilty pleasure \( can i really call it that \) that i choose to subject myself to every so often really what are those things	positive
this is my first review for amazon i ve always felt that the reviews that i read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that i liked not this time i have an extensive collection of anime everything from the really silly stuff filled with fan service to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about i m not really into the mecha thing though i do have a lot of it it s the animation first that drives my interest then its the story and the character development are close seconds appleseed has all that i m looking for in an anime and in spades great characters a well crafted plot and some of the best animation i have ever see to say as some reviewers have that the movement in this version are unnatural is more than unfair it s just not true all action is extremely lifelike and the action scenes are the best i ve ever seen i actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly something i never do i ve owned this version of appleseed a few weeks now and i have watched it at least five times and am looking forward to another veiwing soon i have relied on amazon reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past so i hope that this reveiw is helpful there is a lot of good anime worth investing in and this one is near the top of my list	positive
my 2 year old loves his video the animations are unusual but they are full of flare color and imagination the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter can t get enough of them the main character moustache and the rest of the characters are all well imagined and fun as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time and the semi interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line i personally love this video and would recommend it	positive
let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set i m really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can still inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is do not buy this set spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6 1 dts ex glory alongwith hours of endless in depth bonus features which probably you ll spend rest of your life watching please be aware these new editions do not contain dts tracks no commentary tracks by the director weta workshop or the cast all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc and nothing else it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again and even this is not the end once the hd format gains a little more acceptance they ll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy beware extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience in terms of films or bonus features go get it its worth all the money spent	negative

this film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9 11 \( it s plot included terrorists that sell a bomb \) i also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on tim allen and the comparisons to get shorty rather than as a plot driven movie i tell you though this film is simply funny just like an old marx brothers film the plot is there only to set in motion the quick witted dialogue and interaction between the characters i have enjoyed both of dave barry s humor novels \( this and tricky business \) they made me laugh out loud as did this movie i think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly for those that have laughed at dennis farina from his roles in get shorty and even snatch he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks \( literally \) on his trip to do a quick sniper job tom sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you ll ever see there are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh no matter how many times you have seen it check this one out	positive
i had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the infantastic dvds from amazon i waited over two months kept getting reassured that they were still coming and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme but amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7 11 days which is at best a misrepresentation and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can t provide the product at all at this point i don t really care whose fault it is that the product is never available amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted	negative
i love speilberg films i really do but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap i just do not like it its not my thing i can t belive that richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense if you want to watch it then go ahead we all have different tastes however if you want to see a real speilberg film watch ones like duel jaws et schindler s list jurassic park the lost world jurassic park and the indiana jones trilogy	negative
like many that have seen this movie i have been a fan of the video game series for years and this movie never disappoints me it has everything that makes re great strong characters interesting story and scenes that make me jump at first it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie but milla jovovich is great as the heroine alice the special effects were really good for this movie the licker and the dogs were really impressive the action is also very entertaining when the action is happening i find myself not being able to turn away it is very fast paced i also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team the red queen was an interesing villain as well maybe even more so than the licker overall this movie is way worth seeing and having if you are a fan or even if you aren t a fan of the games the movie is just fun	positive
interestingly this pro apartheid film was produced and written by jack abramoff now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest american congressional corruption scandal in a generation yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators robbed several native american tribes blind tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary and called the choctaw tribal council monkeys and troglodytes had an interesting earlier career he was disqualified from the student government election in his beverly hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits he took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including ralph reed of the christian coalition and longtime republican insider grover norquist but more relevant to this movie well into the 1990 s while actively working in the hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only apartheid goverment of the old south africa and to oppose and discredit nelson mandela and the anc s struggle for majority rule and racial equality during this period he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda paid for by the apartheid government in the old south africa equating the struggle for black liberation in south africa with communism and the soviet union and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority afrikkaner government the hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries or so called soldiers of fortune as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid an amazing historical anomoly this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history involving bribery favors protection of sweatshops \( in us colonies where women are forced into having abortions \) fraud the chritian coalition pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner the owner of sun cruises when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line my advice buy it used for historical purposes not new this guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the american people let s not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder racial segregation perversion of the constitution police state style abuses of civil rights and many other crimes against humanity let s learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the usa let this movie be a record of the power of hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people or to turn away from evil and tell the truth let s make a different legacy this time around	negative
ahh iron eagle a classic of the 1980 s golan globus production mill with the current spate of historic current military movies it s sometimes good to see how hollywood s come in trying to get the details right one can t do much better than using this flick as a baseline in case you aren t already familiar with this gem louis gosset jr playing a reserve air force colonel and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country ok i ll name it libya to rescue the kid s dad pop gets shot down when he s intercepted in international waters but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid s challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully s using his dirt bike suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe he doesn t get his slot at the usaf academy though you gotta take the bad with good i guess when the words on dad get back to the family this kid uses his base network to get access to imagery enemy air defense data and two f16s carrying a b52 s worth of ordinance all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents no less \( if only strike planning was this easy \) of course the kid has flown training missions with his dad and has a boatload of simulator time so he s a natural to fly the mission he convinces gosset to go along with him and his two ship is on the way the flying scenes are nothing spectacular with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys and kfirs \( modified mirages \) acting as migs cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer i m guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit flight and combat models anyway lots of explosions on the way in lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone go figure he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land \( \) and pick him up more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground taxi s out and takesoff he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued rather than the prison sentence for espionage and theft of government property that lou the kid his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should ve got he gets his slot at the air force academy the end overall i guess lou s performance was fairly good but everyone else performed at the grade b level this flick is note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid s buds worth seeing for laughs and as a film version of a kid s pilot fantasy	negative
king vidor s rather contrived adaptation of tolstoy s epic riddled with miscast actors a boring script and a hurried screenplay in short another one of those 50 year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into hollywood s vaults of oblivion the story follows the main characters of tolstoy s novel such as natasha \( audrey hepburn \) prince andrei \( mel ferrer \) and pierre \( henry fonda \) the film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks particularly that of henry fonda as pierre henry fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad charleton heston film as far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer they are as sparse as they are realistic all of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake in short the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that hollywood bothered to put it on dvd apart from that the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue don t buy this film	negative
in an attempt to meet more girls i took french many many years ago when i was still in junior high school \( middle school to you young uns \) in class my french teacher treated us to a film screening of jean cocteau s la belle et la bete \( beauty and the beast \) truthfully back then i didn t think much of it other than being something too arty but over the past two decades i ve seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it la belle et la bete is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema it s certainly cocteau s masterpiece without a doubt it provided the direct inspiration for disney s oscar nominated version as well as greatly influencing cbs s 1987 beauty and the beast television series jean cocteau took madame leprince de beaumont s classic story adapted it and put his own stamp on it cocteau s artistic vision is dazzling to behold the viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch candles vocal household objects jewelry which turns to rubbish etc but nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around belle s family which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality based semblance this atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads josette day and jean marais josette day as belle her most luminous role personified beauty grace and class jean marais on the other hand made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel avenant and the tortured but gentle hearted beast in fact marais portrayed the fearsome beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that in the end when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince cocteau and marais actually received many letters of complaint the women much preferred their kindly beast the criterion collection s high definition crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older grainier copies this film is also well stocked with special features 2 audio commentaries a philip glass opera soundtrack option screening at the majestic a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew interview with the film s director of photography henri alekan secret professionels tete a tete \( professional secrets face to face \) the title of a french television show of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist hagop arakelian who worked on la belle et la bete the original trailer the restoration trailer film restoration segment stills gallery a booklet which includes jean cocteau s notes on the film and a reprinted translation of madame leprince de beaumont s original fable	positive

monkey business looks pretty good on dvd 50 years later the restoration comparison on the dvd shows the change the restoration brought a bit darkly tinted and more defined the wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout marilyn monroe who is the star on the dvd box has more of a supporting role here she is great as the secretary lois laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn t like her punctuation cary grant as the addled professor barnaby fulton turns in a great journeyman performance getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth his driving sequence with monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks ginger rogers as wife edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth if all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions it d be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings hugh marlowe as the straight laced attorney hank entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy indian game oscar winner charles coburn \( 1943 the more the merrier \) does a great job of appreciating monroe s assets as oliver oxly the ceo kathleen freeman as mrs brannigan gives a fine performance the dvd offers perviews of many monroe films this is a great little piece of cinematic history turn back the clock enjoy	positive
i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies though i think the lost world is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies monster movies or horror movies should own all three i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two you will definitely like the third movie	positive
you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut but it s actually the opposite i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people this movie is the real thing i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too	positive
okay the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful the only good thing going for this movie was the return of snake plissken this film s plot was essentially a rehash of the original escape from new york a bit more special effects \( which in fact did not make this a better movie \) when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character characters kurt russell s character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them obviously the movie doesn t really know where it s going as it takes two scenes \( 15 minutes of the film \) \( 1st scene president commandant and lackey give snake the mission \) \( 2nd scene commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission \) to explan to the audience what s the basic conflict i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer carpenter russell please don t tell me money caused you to revisit a cult figure some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson stacy keach steve buscemi and pam grier robertson keach and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters sorry snake i don t love l a the big green pointy eared one	negative

i just wanted to say this is a great workout i love the eastern dance styles i have just written a long review of honey s bollywood workout and people were saying the same things too fast etc but indian dance is taught by imitation and is very expressive facially and bodily \( especially the classical dances \) and open to improv bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical most don t realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating learning and memorizing from the beginning the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying so have fun with this it s awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned and it really wears you out plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form but i find eastern to be the most passionate feminine beautiful and divine have fun	positive

pro great story teriffic acting beautiful setting con some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style \( and culture \) are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character s lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film	positive

hank chinaski can t hold a job can t hold a woman can t control his alcoholism and can t make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society chinaski is the lowest of the semi functioning drunks barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor unfortunately the movie doesn t hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people chinaski s struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into there s no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism the closest he comes to poetics imho is where he tells his ex boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk factotum is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn matt dillon \( hank \) lili taylor \( jan \) and marisa tormei \( laura \) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene the script is stilted without any highs or lows to it the movie isn t near as fatalistic as leaving las vegas or as hard hitting as requiem for a dream and without any of the comedic relief from spun the closest comparison would be the jaw stretching yawn fest of drunks even if you love addiction movies like i do or love dillon or tormei that still isn t enough to recommend this movie if curiosity overcomes you as it did me then rent the movie before buying it it s earned two stars for the acting alone have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this it s that boring	negative
this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list and is probably the best mainstream hollywood movie i can think of i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well great performance by all cast but especially hanks paxton and beacon probably ron howard best film ever	positive

my first favorite television series was twelve o clock high and i had at least two models of the memphis belle when i was kid all of which simply reflects the fact that the b 17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b 17 parked out on somebody s front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it a couple of decades later one of the few b 17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one \( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought \) for all i know that particular b 17 ended up flying in the 1990 film memphis belle when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the memphis belle was on display \( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton ohio this october \) the memphis belle \( serial no 41 24485 \) was one of 12 750 b 17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler s europe without losing a crew member the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down the belle flew from november 7 1942 to may 17 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton jones \( scandal \) from the script by monte merrick \( staying together \) that simply means that besides the fact that the memphis belle was named for a lady friend \( margaret polk \) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same \( designed by the famous artist george petty \) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission which was over lorient france and not bremen germany \( the belle flew there on its 21st mission \) the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane s mascot a scotty dog named stuka so if you want something closer to the true story of the pilot robert morgan and the memphis belle you want to check out william wyler s 1944 documentary the memphis belle a story of a flying fortress what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clich s from war movies involving airplanes then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator tate donovan as the co pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home d b sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret reed edward diamond as the flight engineer courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the belle of course it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the memphis belle is remembered for completing that final mission so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run \( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the belle and they changed the name of the aircraft as well \) but even if the belle survives there are other several b 17 crews on the mission who will not still the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated allowing modine s character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan s character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else s job	positive
there can t be a better storyteller than teddy ruxpin as i child i was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy teddy ruxpin as i waited for saturday morning to come again so i could see another episode of the tv series this show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one so many cartoons are just one shots an individual small plot for each episode teddy ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure along the way kids learn important morals values and a lot about their own world this is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age and what a great price well worth it	positive

i saw this movie and i found it both shocking and choking it displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars \( yes the cigarettes and the smoke were real not cg \) i think they should have omitted such scenes from the script because it displays a behavior that s not only illegal in several countries but also threatening to both society and childhood no matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie i give it a disgusting 1 and this is the last movie i ever watch that depicts smoking children to those that haven t yet watched this movie please don t watch it unless you want cancer to win the health wars and here i hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker if you want to depict smoking children use computer graphics instead of the real thing	negative
i was disappointed with this longer version of the mill on the floss i thought being bbc and a long version it would be a definitive one but i have to agree with the other reviewer this version left out some very important events and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving i like long movies but this dragged because it just doesn t hold your attention the 1997 masterpiece theatre version is so much more powerful and keeps all important events intact spending less time on maggie s mother worrying about the fate of her china and more on character and plot development with a very haunting score i really hope the other version is released on dvd if so i will probably donate this one to the library because i can t quite see myself rewatching it i would rather read the book instead	negative
ray sawyer \( rick cramer \) agnes bruckner \( eden \) laura ramsey \( rachel \) jonathan jackson \( eric \) and d j cotrana \( sean \) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie eric and eden are going through any typical teen romance going steady one minute broken up the next eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress one evening ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food known as the local nut case ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town later that same evening ray comes upon eric and eden on a lonely bridge swerving to miss eric s jeep ray instead crashes into an on coming car the impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge the car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car after pulling her to safety ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about however both ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below to make matters worse the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes who immediately begin striking at ray all that can be heard are ray s screams as the car sinks ray s body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue but it doesn t remain there for long it seems that the woman in the car was a voodoo priestess and the snakes were used to cleanse people by drawing the evil out of them now the evil venom is flowing through ray now begins a bloodbath of carnage as ray possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him begins to stalk unsuspecting victims one by one he exacts his revenge on eden s friends until only eden remains who will win this final showdown ray or eden i ve always been a big fan of slasher type films and characters like freddy from the nightmare on elm street series as well as jason from friday the 13th ray sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly the motives are the same kill as many teenagers as possible and ray succeeds in this very well i thought the story involving voodoo was well conceived the special effects were good too i recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans although the movie is short \( only about 80 minutes \) there s lots of slashing in a short amount of time if you enjoy a good slasher flick then don t miss venom	positive
i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs and you re infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again they come up with this idiotic scheme which ended up in disaster \( both the hilton and auto world closed within a year \) moore in recent years has become a political celebrity in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it s not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them aren t really interested in changing anything as it might interfere with their livelihoods i don t know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent darkly funny film about real class warfare and the dismantling of the working class in america	positive

the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there s no mystery	negative
jennifer jason can someone puhleeze tell me why she always plays the same role and why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution the so called bostonish or upper crust east coast accent does not include slurring your words as if a consonant was too much work it as if her upper lip is never engaged at all not even to smirk does she have a botox complex use your face including your upper lip but then again maybe she was acting just like dorothy parker who ahem happens to be dead \( no disrespect intended \) jennifer beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance why didn t she play parker i believed her character gwyneth love her bit part but she added a much needed warmth to the film i cared for one character and the best part was his bit giving a financial report i thought that was brilliant bravo but mr benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character thank you will someone please make this film over and do it right and don t just call up your buds for a tupperware party and say hey lets make a movie dorothy parker deserves much much better i can t even imagine the biting remarks she would print how about it s all about me and i hated it but the costumes were nice	negative
not what i expected when renting this movie as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent futhermore i don t understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world everyone knows what lovelace has done there are numerous accounts yet she goes with him anyway blah the acting was ok the costumes were excellent \( i love period movies \) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged and as another put it i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket i read a lot of historical fiction classic novels and love period movies but there was no liking this one it just couldnt be done	negative
dennis leary is hailed as some great angry young man who is trying to bring the world to rights personally i prefer bill hicks at least when bill did it he was being original dennis leary has in my opinion nicked bill hicks act in a similar way to how i feel about joss stone compared to proper soul artists sitting in front of a few live videos of a great man and taking notes does not mean you will ever be one dennis definately a must have for anyone who enjoys covers bands stick to the acting dennis	negative
therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages 13 14 15 16 and 17 cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run of the mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick \( of course \) but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines \( such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation \) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future	negative
i worried that the 80s soundtrack would detract from the film s power as a period piece but it totally didn t it was seamless i will buy this for my home collection i have always loved kirsten dundst s work and this is no exception	positive
the movie starts out with our hero izo being gruesomly crucified because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really including having sex with mother nature a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face being killed several times a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back killing little children killing a group of mothers in the hallway vampires being attacked by a swat team and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar while he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion this movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it	positive

before i review i d like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show and so i figured eventually i d have to get around to seeing the movie which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they re both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name \( which i have not read so i don t know which is more accurate \) but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way there are many things i don t like about this movie the biggest being poor pacing the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler but that s the biggest problem there s not really enough story to last a full length feature because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short and since they didn t have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes \( there are barely any and they aren t very impressive for the most part \) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won t understand more than 60 of and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we re looking at either nothing or a woman s nipples that s not cinematic artistry that s being either lazy or perverted the animation itself isn t even that good especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago it s choppy and there s not really a whole lot of detail \( except when it comes to women s nipples \) looking at just the animation if i didn t know better i d have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980 s the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell it s probably kind of like how i didn t see the 1989 batman movie until years after i d been spoiled by batman the animated series and couldn t bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman everything about the tv series is superior to this movie the animation the stories the character developement the production values i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is in short if you re you re at all interested in the gits franchise do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead you ll find a lot to love but i can t say the same about the movie my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex	negative

pushing the envelope for explicit over the counter home videos 9 songs \( tartan \) is about one year of sex and rock n roll in the life of two lovers matt is a young glaciologist he meets lisa at a london rock concert that night they start an affair in between attending more concerts they make passionate love it s for real and explicit nine live concert song footage is intercut with their coke snorting sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship and finally all this takes place in the memory of matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the south pole this unscripted film is part musical part drama part documentary and part performance it raises questions about the difference between pornography and art controversial and much buzzed about this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been and of course the sex a special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances	negative
a dismal disappointment i think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy when i see the high ratings i wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product the original lonesome dove mini series was unbelievably well done a complete multifaceted joy i was so excited when i saw there was a sequel and the joy of lonesome dove would continue well it didn t and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings	negative
let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even boring to my friends so it isn t the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me it isn t the unresolved ending that bothered me it wasn t the violence \( in short bursts \) it wasn t the acting \( the acting was pretty good actually \) but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure i didn t care who was sending the tapes and i didn t care what would happen with the main characters they were unrelatable on just about any level this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3 4 s of the way in and you ll think wow i wonder where the story will go next and then it doesn t that was it very disappointing i don t mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there s some kinda payoff in the end i really don t understand all the acclaim that this movie got as a suspense movie or as an art film it fails pretty miserably the premise was a good idea that went nowhere slowly viewer beware	negative
wow i bought this set a couple of months ago and i ve been watching each episode little by little and enjoying each one of them a lot it s interesting to watch captain scarlet again thirty something years after the last time i watched it back in the late 60s \( when i was 7 or 8 years old \) i was \( and still am \) a huge fan of the thunderbirds and became quite delighted when this new series from gerry anderson first appeared on tv back in the 60s the quality of captain scarlet s special effects obviously got better since the thunderbirds and it really makes a huge difference \( as far as realism is concerned \) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned so much so that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes the production still looks fabulous after all these years the design of vehicles machines personal equipment weapons buildings etc is quite enjoyable interesting and sometimes even surprising the angels \( both airplanes and pilots \) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age for they look quite dated indeed however now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 chrysler and ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series thirty something years later most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow almost stupid but one has to remember that this series was meant for children so once you remember this you ll be ready to have a great time watching captain scarlet and his fellow spectrum buddies fight the evil mysterons \( led by the sinister looking captain black \) just as you did when you were still a child spectrum is green enjoy it	positive

this movie is truly wonderfully done i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou s commentary on academics in modern rural china the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities there are english subtitles for beginners as well i highly recommend it	positive
i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	negative

i used to have respect for bill maher he used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies but not anymore my respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for gwb and religion i watched i m swiss once and almost couldn t refrain from vomiting he talks about the usual suspects the president religion obesity same sex marriage rap and few other things that comedians are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about i know i know he s not a liberal he s a libertarian well i have watched and listened to bill maher and i know which side he s on most of the time and it sure isn t on the right he hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time i don t know why his panties are in such a bunch being organized is better than being disorganized \( i can tell jokes too \) i m not religious and i can t help but see much of it as hard to swallow but i m not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders i wasn t there when the bible was written or when the events took place i can t say it s all fairtyales i can only say some of it isn t logical but i respect religion and its purposes which is what separates me from him he has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion which are both things that make life more bearable for them the purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation the same purpose of drugs i might add something maher not only defends but abuses why the double standard this is no longer the eleventh century where protestants are killing catholics the only people k illing in the name of religion are fanatical muslims but most religious people are good decent nonviolent individuals maher s not an atheist but he has recently expressed a could be could be not attitude toward the existence of a g od which would make him agnostic but one thing is for sure atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does two of our biggest mass murderers hitler and stalin were atheist it s a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than maher who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one most of the time he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself i laughed twice during the entire show no one has ever accused maher of being modest he s a smug intellectual elitist and those are his good qualities i m swiss displays this all too clearly in case you didn t know i m swiss is a running joke of maher s embarrassment of being an american he d rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for not an extension of morality where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all where adultery is seen as cute not sinful where there are no fat people where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions thank god i live in america and not switzerland	negative

this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film and has many flaws a silly plot cheap religious imagery \( dracula is judas jeez louise \) and not one truly sexy or scary moment and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula s brides including jennifer esposito jeri ryan if you can t make a film sexy with these two you re in the wrong business craven has an over inflated rep as a director he doesn t deserve any rep as a producer if this leaden film is a sample it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison save your money and pick up something scary instead like bava s black sunday or any hammer horror	negative
i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that s exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i didn t like was william hurt s performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would ve moved along at a better pace but still a great movie	positive
i ll give the leads the benefit of the doubt that they re actually a lot better than this lame o flick deserves kutcher and murphy are tom and sara the mismatched couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains for laughs after a whirlwind romance sara introduces tom to her tony beverly hills family they marry and the rest \( much like their marriage \) is quickly history things go bad from the wedding night \( bloody noses no sex \) and only get worse after tom nearly burns down the french chalet that sara booked them into \( after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage differences in europe and an electric sex toy \) and compounds problems by taking them to the worst hotel in venice \( cockroaches dust and no sex \) our heroes quickly realize that they are on the honeymoon from hell at first they gamely make a go of it not realizing that they re only saving their tension for the perfect moment just married was a simple idea for a flick people have been laughing at marriage for years maybe that s why the jokes seem forced the sex toy fiasco painfully illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh and we get that one early on every joke is actually half of a joke about sara and tom can t have sex climaxing \( really no pun intended i mean it \) when sara tricks custom s inspectors into giving her hated hubby a full rectal exam \( cut to the scene of tom walking bow legged onto the plane obviously he s the victim but in the perverse logic of this unsexual non comedy you ve got to wonder whether tom is actually the victor he at least got some \) the script can t get past a monumental plot gap tom and sara really don t have anything in common you d think they d have learnt and gotten past their foibles while they dated but the story skips past much of that tom s the hero but he s an idiot the script makes him out as the ugly american an utterly dated cliche \( he s surprised that nobody in europe watches american baseball he s the kind of idiot who uses american instead of english when referring to language as in why isn t there a sign in american warning against using us voltage sex toys in france the laughs are far and few in between the best ones involve cars \( both the ridiculous sub compact they rent in france and the dodge barracuda \( at least i think it s a cuda \) that tom drives a monster which was probably meant to remind us about that 70 s show but which looks like a prop from the phantasm movies if ever there was a flick that needed help from the tall man this is it	negative

leeches is a terrible movie dude i have never seen anything so gay in my whole life \( except the director s other film speed demon \) when the guys were less clothes than the gals thats not a good sign the video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director s work they re all filled with loads of homoeroticism women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks the roided up leeches enter their male victims through anal orrifices after watching about a half hour of this mess i had to turn it off why does this guy fool people into renting these movies i don t mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it s time to draw the line no hetro relationships in this one just the director molesting his male stars with his camera horrible stuff stay away from david decoteau s work and his fifty different aliases \( unless you know what you re in for \)	negative
the show is absolutely great blue falcon is another space ghost and dynomut is the futuristic version of scooby doo dim witted and loveable getting the complete show is great and the shows from these hb vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors \( amid some nasty scratches and dust but it was cheap animation folks \) as a scooby fan this is a must own i quite enjoy the blue falcon dynomut show also 5 stars for the show the set however nice still drops the ball you get two single sided dvds and two flippers the problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1 16th of an inch between them both i know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear but then again if it was a perfect world we couldn t complain all in all a solid set 4 1 2 out of 5	positive
well not to bad a deal most of the movies here aren t too bad \( the inspector general a farewell to arms a star is born etc \) and have basically clear picture and sound quality it s true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good there is a problem with this set however after you ve watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and i discovered this when we wanted to watch the flying deuces for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue my advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale very cheap and to just rent some of the better ones we did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered buster keaton w c fields and charlie chaplin because of this for instance \( and after we liked father s litle dividend we decided to watch father of the bride which was even better \) so i have decided to give it an extra star just for that	negative
dvd 1 presents a terrific hour long history of the franchise it hits both the high and lowpoints and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history lambeau hutson lombardi starr nitschke the ice bowl favre white the nine nfl championships the three super bowls they won \( i ii and xxxi \) and the one they lost \( xxxii \) the best fans in the league the smallest venue the most legendary stadium and the team s miraculous survival over 80 years in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans the highpoint of course is the 15 minute section entitled lombardi which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl s greatest coach but at the end of this dvd about the packers heroic ongoing history you realize that as great as lombardi was the team is greater still dvd 2 was produced earlier in vhs format \( i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb \) and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history other reviewers have justly praised its play by play reconstruction and modern day interviews with the participants yes kramer was offside but luck is a part of any game and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter like another reviewer i love the postgame interviews even the glimpses of green bay in 1967 the muted colors of the frigid game \( maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s i see the same thing in footage of other games \) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed	positive
i watched this with my parents and didn t like marlons mouth reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something he cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far what is cool about that that whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school and my neighborhood the rest of the movie was all right but marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity sorry that s just my opinion	negative
the slick stylish spanish thriller nobody knows anybody is set in seville during holy week in the year 2000 newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would be writer simon cardenas \( eduardo noriega \) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word adversary as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue since the message also contained threats simon does what he s told and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events directed by mateo gil nobody knows anything opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory the film which owes much of its style to american thrillers is slickly produced and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of seville help but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience i was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot however once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear \( and i can t give away too much here \) the film became silly and trite there s little character development our hero is a flat dull passive character and the film s emphasis is on the thrill aspect a slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous this film is in spanish with english subtitles displacedhuma	negative

this was the first silent film that i saw in its entire form the 1927 king of kings directed by cecil b demille as with d w griffth charlie chaplin and greta garbo he is right up their amoung silent icons this movie starring h b warner as jesus is a truely a jewel of a film everyone knows the story but it is told very well here demille knew his bible films like ten commandments \( 1924 1956 \) samson and delilah and this movie the king of kings the film maybe dated a tiny bit but can the story of jesus be dated i love jesus movies like jesus of nazareth the greatest story ever told the 1961 king of kings and the musicals jesus christ superstar and godspell and the story of christ was also tackled in the 1916 d w griffth classic intolerence but this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail the special effects are amazing for 1927 the crucifixion scene is astondishing and a scene in color which is the resurrection scene the cast of characters is also amazing in our era of movies if you need a big scene a will have only 100 people and cgi the other tens of thousands since there was no cgi back in 1927 or computers for that matter they directors like demillie and griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics i know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old they are a gateway to the past without those groundbreaking films no one would care about movies those early silents were the catalyst for what would become i would recommend this film this movie is a true classic no matter what religion you are	positive
warner herzog s grizzly man won the director s guild award for best feature documentary but the people who pass out oscars apparently didn t agree grizzly man was not among this year s nominees for best documentary many of herzog s narrative films such as fitzcaraldo deal with man s attempt to challenge the indifference of nature so grizzly man is not a departure by any means herzog s heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious even bizarre goal timothy treadwell s fixation is on grizzly bears i am one of them he is heard to say he survived in the wild accompanied by a video camera and on at least one occasion by a girlfriend living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting animals rule he said fist defiantly pumping in the air timothy conquered treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life appearing once on david letterman s cbs show but he aspired to more before letting his love of animals consume him he tried his luck in hollywood he got an agent and auditioned for tv and movie roles he was he told his parents second choice for the bartender role on cheers which went to woody harrelson missing out on that opportunity left him crushed what really drove treadwell he reminds me of fey little carson on queer eye for the straight guy and as he openly mentions that it s easier to be gay than straight i wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable grizzly bears i like girls he volunteers but then he mentions various cruising places truck stops men s rooms in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts he was also an alcoholic were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue those who are seen offering their remembrances of treadwell never allude to his sexuality they describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive hippy new age approach to nature and who died as a result the bears to whom he gave names like mr chocolate and tabitha need protection he said and he was their self appointed caretaker others suggest that despite his good intentions he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined after treadwell was eaten by a bear the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at kfc for eating chicken what is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf treadwell was an intruder one mans saystreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits but treadwll knew these were animals trouble is his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from disney cartoons the universe director herzog says is ruled by hostility chaos and murder treadwell had a different philosophy isn t that sad he squeals in his high pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing his pollen thing i love that bee he says partially financed by the discovery channel grizzly man is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans but it s also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because he admitted he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows he also needed to record his solitary life on video we see him crying as he pets a wolf laughing when his command that god make it rain seems to have been obeyed and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals what we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him mercifully the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked the camera was running though and treadwell s screams and the screams of his girlfriend were recorded out of respect for his family herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings instead we see him listening to the audio and his reaction \( telling one of treadwell s friends that she must never listen to it just as she must never see the coroner s photos of the aftermath of the attack \) is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film i had no life treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts now i have a life that life is memorialized in herzog s film brian w fairbank	positive
this movie is intimate and special some reviews say it is the story of obsession of fetishism of trivial things however this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy s life his fantasy woman the character malena rarely speaks throughout the movie but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young love this perspective makes her ideal and special with few flaws as a fantasy woman is to a young man malena is instantly a likeable character not awful and disgusting like those using her we cannot forget that our narrator renato is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story therefore he is unreliable as a narrator malena s sins are washed clean through his judgement and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women however renato has had years to think about everything to contemplate what really happened to her so in the end the people who use her are completely despicable unable to garner any liking of course she is a victim but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men the movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems she is from another city and her husband for most of the movie is dead yet she chooses to not escape but to stay and her fate is sealed the music in the movie was nominated for best score in 2000 and it is beautiful emotional it truly adds to the feeling of the movie i would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story emotion and characters you will never forget this movie	positive

i lived through the vietnam era if you did you can t ever forget this guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong why it went wrong and what we can learn to keep from repeating it for me here was the most unforgettable moment decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days macnamara tells him we the americans were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china the north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said mr macnamara you must have never read a history book we ve been fighting the chinese for a thousand years we aren t their puppet we were fighting for our national freedom we would have fought to the last man macnamara says they almost came to blows here s the point macnamara says as compared to say the soviets we didn t understand the north vietnamese we didn t really know enought about them we had no idea what was in their minds and that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons that s why we lost does any of this sound familiar this is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age it s that good and that informative of course it won t be widely viewed by the american public we ll go our goofy way coveting our big screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things like sporting events	positive
first off let me say that i know next to nothing about art i would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork but it certainly does not come naturally especially when it comes to modern art dali however is a master i at least have some affinity with who doesn t know of the melting clocks i have also seen the dream sequence he created for hitchcock s film spellbound in 1945 plus the guy was just plain weird and that is something i know a little bit about myself this artists of the 20th century dvd looks solely at dali s artwork all you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another there is no biographical look at the man no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality \( or mustache \) there is not even an adequate identification of gala his inspiration and muse despite numerous references to her in his paintings thus this dvd will not introduce you to dali the man or dali the artist it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro dali s artwork is obviously impressive and i was surprised by the variety of his work and styles the narrator offers insight into some paintings others you just look and advance i don t understand a lot of dali s work nor can i see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces the melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me dark works such as visage of war speak volumes to the human observer and the disappearing bust of voltaire paintings are also striking i was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces dali painted however largely because i did not know he ever produced such works my idea of a painting equates with something like design for the interior decoration of a stable library which is a strikingly beautiful work is this dvd worth watching i will have to say no if you re a know nothing novice like me there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown if you re knowledgeable about dali you ll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite dali works excluded from the show after watching this i decided to peruse some dali galleries online and i must say that the internet makes this dvd of little value not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the dvd	negative

this movie was much better than vanilla sky vanilla sky mostly copied open your eyes but was too obvious and less convincing \( and tom cruise though good in some roles didn t fit this role well \) open your eyes takes a little longer to draw you in but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where vanilla sky does also the jungian dream aspect in vanilla sky is poorly done whereas open your eyes represents the dream experience very well i recommend watching both movies before you buy one but if you re going to buy get open your eyes	positive

despite the chintzy unconvincing facial hair \( jeff daniels being the exception \) martin sheen s too gentlemanly interpretation of gen lee s accent \( and his beard \) obvious saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war generalized \( and largely inaccurate \) interpretations of the underlying history of the war and hopelessly ridiculously wildly off the mark attempts atnew england accents the film still works i understand that to get a film produced and distributed it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice and c thomas howell s performance well let s just say that his glued on beard was more convincing than his acting jeff daniels however does an excellent job in large part because he doesn t try to convince you he s from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers using every stereotype associated with nasal r dropping instead of focusing on the so called nasality of the ne accent \( think of sheen in the missiles of octobah \) daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief but then here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner aren t the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production i think the story works because there s enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle but the movie makers either didn t have the budget for gore \( maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards \) or decided to err on the side of forbearance if gettysburg had been made 8 10 years later it might have benefited from the newer style of violence depiction as in saving private ryan thin red line or gladiator it falls a bit short of that however finally it should be noted that the producers director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war s historical underpinnings opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery they fought to preserve the union which is a very different concept abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south s hand but it was not the sole cause of the war the movie dumbs this down a bit making the message more like what you d find in a 5th grade text book the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war the north absolutely needed to win it but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost 2 years after gettysburg c thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie still and all the film is very watchable and due credit should be given to the re enactors arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film	positive
in response to the earlier reviewer this is sergio garrone s django il bastardo not the other film the reviewer mentioned django il bastardo is a small gem among spaghetti westerns a low budget b movie in which a ghost \( django \) avenges his own death \( a topic later adapted by clint eastwood for his high plains drifter \) hence steffen s wooden acting is totally appropriate for the role a little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors \( a standout is luciano rossi as the main baddie s insane brother \)	positive

i wouldn t recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone due to a high content of bad words screaming and violence it s kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else some people really enjoyed it and that s not me and that s not the other two people i know who watched it some violent parts are a bit hard to believe but i guess that s what the story is about this movie is a bit of a hollywood style suspense with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies there s one good idea in this movie and that s how life develops as it goes along and one action or inaction changes how life plays out but this is no where near original even the simpsons had an episode like that so this movie is definitely not on my best movies list	negative

the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars this set was poorly put together the shorts included are quite random and buying this set would be a waste of money each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters first there is alfalfa then buckwheat spanky darla porky mickey stymie then fatty oh wait no that is joe cobb only they didn t know his real name then farina and last phil macmahon who you may be asking phil macmahon the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938 still don t know him maybe that is because he wasn t a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot it is one of my favorite shorts from the series however it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races the films themselves are very good disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents it is a total disaster just like in reunion in rhythm one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry the film has been seriously cut there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores but it works there are sound effects too sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train it is a very cute film farina is especially funny in it the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video s soundtracks the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship when it sinks they find a real one to destroy this short has also been cut there is no opener for it either it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it disk three opens with mary queen of tots it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang she dreams they come to life and when she wakes up she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters the print on this one is not bad at all the last film is school s out a talkie featuring a different cast it is a film featuring miss crabtree the new teacher the picture is good it seems to be the one from cabin fever disk four begins with bear shooters this is a less than great film the print is great it is the one from cabin fever our gang follies of 1938 is a great film very funny long and exciting it features the later talkie cast waldo s last stand is a film from the later mgm years a lesser film that seems forced it was also released in a 5 part rascals set disk five is the extra features dvd it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show on it some of the silent gang are reunited joe cobb jackie condon farina hoskins johnny downs and mickey daniels are featured the documentary called kid stuff really doesn t have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview other child stars like jackie coogan judy garland shirley temple roddy mcdowall and ron howard are focused on as well the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain many of them have been available cheaply for years the only reason a fan might want to see this collection the same reason i bothered was to see the rarer silent films however the rest of the set is trash	negative
when i first put this dvd in i noticed that they cut away the opening then the movie starts and i can t believe my eyes as the quality of the dvd is even lower than my vcd version this is just frustrating to watch the subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can t even be read another thing is the audio you can t switch between cantonese and mandarin like on my vcd yes this too was fixed to cantonese only there is no extra features you might as well buy a vhs tape which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality it does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused vhs tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting customers \( read victims \)	negative
my objection was the implication that the stars played a part in the film i felt that the picture was completely deceptive ms richards and ms hanna had less than 15 minutes \( maybe a little more but not much and possible even less \) and were clearly there to fool the viewer it was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary	negative

black hawk down hasn t got an interesting story on offer when a bunch of marines is stranded in mogadishu somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them from there it is just angry men running and shooting although this is what you would expect from a war movie black hawk down remains way below average i think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns as this movie was based on events that truly took place probably americans will appreciate black hawk down a little more \( sarr \)	negative
there are plenty of anti bush films and books around if you only shall see or read one this must be the best pick i like michael moore very much but he is not really a political heavyweighter and i don t think fahrenheit 9 11 is his best work it does not mix humour and political insight as well as the book stupid white men for instance it is more like two or three movies in one william karel is a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary but what a documentary it has turned out to be very disturbing insights from informed sources among them former cia agents it is not usual to hear such plain speaking from people in high places just a few years after the events this film is perhaps not as entertaining as fahrenheit 9 11 but far more informative	positive
how families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star laden 1996 movie but stage and tv director jerry zaks screenwriter scott mcpherson and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant based on a play by mcpherson before he succumbed to aids the semi autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged middle aged sisters in florida mousey spinster bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father marvin and their eccentric aunt ruth in ohio lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in ohio only to see things fall apart lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to lee and her sons as potential bone marrow transplant candidates the rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable intriguingly while the soap opera elements are strictly by the numbers there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece it also helps that meryl streep and diane keaton play the sisters as the embittered guilt ridden lee streep moves easily back into blue collar silkwood territory and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self centered character however it s a vanity free keaton who really radiates as bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances a year before titanic leonardo di caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as lee s oldest son hank a textbook example of teenaged pyromaniac angst the rest of the cast is fine in limited turns robert deniro \( one of the producers as well \) as the bumbling dr wally dan hedaya as his even more pixilated brother bob gwen verdon as wild eyed soap opera obsessed aunt ruth hal scardino as hank s self controlled little brother charlie and hume cronyn who is forced to play marvin with severely limited expression there are predictable moments throughout but some surprise and a few actually enthrall including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when bessie recalls the drowning death of her open mouthed carny boyfriend there are no extras with the 1999 dvd release	positive
\( 4 5 5 stars \) exceptional envisioning of the batman comic book by tim burton michael keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in batman begins both are equally effective though one style over the other will likely appeal to you is there any topping jack nicholson in his role as jack napier the joker only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie even though his role is suitably funny there is a little too much humor overall in the movie robert wuhl s character is especially unnecessarily comical also while danny elfman s score is duly heroic and compelling the music by prince just doesn t mesh well and is probably not the best choice nonetheless the visuals are stunning the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining it is a testament to the film s influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used danny elman scores \( including rival marvel s spider man \) and molded black rubber suits though this film also owes much to 1978 s superman with its realistic approach and a list villains great stuff	positive

this is my second favorite john woo movie with great touches of action and drama when i first saw this film \( about 5 years ago \) i wasn t used to seeing this much violence on screen \( and i thought lethal weapon was extremely violent at that time \) i was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped this film is very violent but compared to other action films this is really tame nowadays the minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots some weird cuts and editing the subs were terrible as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad but this is john woo s first \( if you can count heroes shed no tears \) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse much worse yun fat chow ti lung and leslie chung have their good moments to bad moments most of the good moments goes to chow and ti while leslie had only one or two moments the plot is like this a cop must confront his criminal brother that s it if your the typical hollywood action goer this is your perfect find but as i said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don t make this your first one i ll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on but if your the hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on this film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre i really recommend this film to any action fan	positive

i am from australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to amazon is a complete season of baywatch really baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing i don t think so not only have the distributors done fans no favours but amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast on the amazon website as part of advertising for season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it if you go by the cast that amazon have put on you would think that it was the real original season 1 when we know it is not the release in the uk which is out now and the upcoming release in australia on march 14th is the real deal season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct there are no episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal aaro	negative

saw hart s war the other night and couldn t really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days here are ten reasons why 1 this film isn t the great escape and even though he would probably like to think otherwise bruce willis isn t steve mcqueen even though willis received top billing this is a colin farrell vehicle 2 the vast majority of the target audience of 18 34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration much less world war ii hart s war may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812 anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets 3 as far as depicting life in a pow camp hart s war is pretty much on par with hogan s heroes the germans are nice guys with guns who don t know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything where did the gi s get all those cigarettes anyway 4 any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him as depicted in hart s war the camp commandant \( as portrayed by marcel lures \) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army his collection of american jazz blues records is a cute writer s invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps in reality the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic 5 the storyline is not completely unbelievable trials did take place in pow camps one good example being the pow s who were tried and hung in andersonville however the whole idea that the camp s commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous 6 the idea that during the trial a group of pow s who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions the german army simply wasn t that stupid 7 i saw this film once and didn t like it i thought that maybe the second time would be better it wasn t 8 beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness hart s war seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which for most pow s was just day to day survival also the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans weren t spineless hapless dopes 9 bruce willis playing the same role in variations of die hard over and over and over again is tiring 10 better films about the same sort of subject matter are the tuskeegee airmen and stalag 17 hopefully in a few years hart s war will be completely forgotten and these dvd s will be rotting in some landfill	negative

i have several kathy smith videos this is the absolute worse i agree with some of the other reviewers that kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated also it seems like there a too many people in such a small space the whole set looks very chaotic i wonder if kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself it is very poor all those crazy shuffle moves any other kathy smith workout will be better for you than this one	negative

brando can sing guys and dolls is proof one of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955 has brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by the voice sinatra now only a mad man will say that brando is a better singer than sinatra but to give brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly like wise only a mad man will say sinatra is a better actor than brando guys and dolls is a very important film in brando s career it is the first light hearted movie he made all his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff this is the first movie where brando is having fun and what fun it was great songs great acting and great stars guys and dolls is 4 star entertainment all the way brando and simmons along with sinatra and blaine are amazing	positive
the movie is excellent i was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage but the regular dvd is excellent as well not many additional features but the movie is delightful and although slightly longer then some holds the viewers interest minor amounts of nudity some very graphic fist fighting but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot one of ron howard s best films	positive

the is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals families and society the film is graphic in its depiction of addiction but as an addiction counselor who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery it is very close to actual tragic events i have seen in the world of addiction the emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent these events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many unfortunately even though some of the content may be offensive to some it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction s final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life watch and learn the truth about severe addiction	positive
this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy the first time i did it i felt a bit awkward with the steps but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine if someone like denise austin were leading this one i don t think i would play along minna is by far my favorite instructor so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout i wouldn t want to do this every day but it is good to have something different in the rotation i think the toning section is excellent i am not looking to bulk up i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises it s easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights minna is a great instructor she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging she is never annoying i also have her optimizer balanced blend dvd and i love that one	positive
cursed is the most pathetic werewolf movie i ve seen since an american werewolf in paris the acting is terrible directing is poor \( shame on you mr craven \) and the storyline is largely uncompelling the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience this movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is cool but if you re looking for a scary movie don t look for cursed well at least it s not as bad as an american werewolf in paris but that sure as hell isn t saying much	negative
after enjoying cowboy bebop and samurai champloo someone recommended checking out flcl aka fooly cooly if you enjoyed those previous titles i would suggest steering clear of this particular anime the art is interesting enough but the story is simply lacking the characters are completely and utterly undeveloped it almost seems like they are making fun of you for watching their anime this the second dvd of three and has 40 minutes of programming i read somewhere that this was not even a real show and that they threw it together to test out new animation techniques if you ve seen all 6 episodes and are still wondering what the heck was that this does not seem to be untrue please i strongly suggest you skip watching this program because it is simply put garbage	negative

this movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list overall i was somewhat disappointed with this film i figured there would be a little more real suspense or thrill but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events the biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between eastwood and russo it was contrived lame and almost laughable i had to rub my eyes to make sure i wasnt having a nightmare john malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves clint eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self no problem here though clint was solid the film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end the climax was rather anti climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although i saw it coming a mile away there was not as much suspense as i was hoping for and the thrill was mostly missing what else can i say watch it and make your own decision but overall i was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews	negative

alec baldwin has always been the best host of snl \( along with walken and spacey \) and this makes a pretty good case why the opening sketch with the press conference about prince charles is priceless and what could be more demented than canteen boy baldwin is so over the top in that that what is a really really sick joke is actually funny but the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time the tony bennet show \( i was seizing during this one \) the joe pesci show \( with baldwin doing deniro \) and the zinger sketch which just got funnier as it went along even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re recording his greeting only to listen back to it and hear a gay man there are a couple of clunkers planet truth was just not that funny and maybe two others didn t need to be here including one so so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included paul mccartney the bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on air and a great audio track by baldwin and the producer of snl which provides lots of really really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves absolutely hilarious	positive

git r done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head but end up doubling you over with laughter his preformance will definitely torque your brain so be prepared there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don t fart they don t even have buttholes he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever unless you are an idiot you know you can t look like him without a strict training regiment nice try larry he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti hillary clinton piece this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary i think larry the cable guy	negative

following the series of firefly serenity continues the story line for a few more steps there are so many ways this movie is packed i cannot begin to properly mention them here the storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a solving the mystery approach the english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing the animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality the characters are complex focused solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations the challenges the crew of serenity face are many from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority alliance forces to the overt mortal threat of the reavers the climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue the music in serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more i suggest seeing the series firefly before watching the movie serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters	positive
barbershop is a rare event in african american filmmaking it s one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for african americans i love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the african american community is we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen i really liked this movie we definitely need more films like this calvin is the owner of a chicago barbershop passed on to him by his late father mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life it s not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood there are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they re all easy to follow one follows a stolen atm machine one follows the quest for love of an african immigrant another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview and yet another follows a white barber s quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with in a way this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like pulp fiction that follow many characters and their stories each of the stories lead up to the ending where calvin saves the barbershop director tim story does a great job of capturing life in chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop i felt the spirit of the windy city and the informal environment of the barbershop watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in harlem my father used to take me to when i was a boy it also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop i used to go to get my flat top trimmed \( both are closed now \) \( there are a ton of great performances in this movie i m probably going to miss mentioning a few people ice cube is great as calvin i liked his performance here michael ealy stands out in his role as an ex con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber ealy makes you feel his characters desperation cedric the entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber he s funny and poignant sean nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college anthony anderson and larenz tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an atm with no money in it watching them try to open will make you laugh keith david is creepy as the loan shark then again keith david is always good in anything he does i d pay money to watch him and sam jackson read listings in the yellow pages i don t know why movie critics and the rev jesse jackson denounced barbershop it s one of the best movies ever made about african american life looking at the box office of barbershop and diary of a mad black woman african americans actually want more films like this as a black moviegoer i want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community not just one small part of it i for one and tired of the hood movies like never die alone and critically acclaimed movies like monster s ball and hustle flow that depict black life as something negative \( thankfully it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too the box office and dvd sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like barbershop and diary of a mad black woman are going up \) end of rant back to the review a shawn james essential five star video you must buy this movie get some friends together put the dvd in the machine pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the tv and hang out at the barbershop	positive
the funny thing about this movie is that i read negative reviews here and rather agree with what they assert that the plots and some of the characters are not very evolved due to time if you disect the movie yes this is true nonetheless i love this movie i love watching the what the actors do with this material and how they manage with so little time to invest the viewer in their story emma thompson gives a perfect performance i think highlighting how complicated long marriages can become and the pitfalls of being too functional bill nighy is hilarious acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments quite refreshing most of all it is genuinely funny life can feel \( or at least my life can feel \) disjointed and i love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections	positive

the casting for this production could scarcely be better \( of particular note is the harrowing performance of judi dench \) and it s one of shakespeare s best plays that said this film of a production on stage doesn t quite carry the viewer s interest for the entire play there are times when the actors seem downright pretentious you feel as if they re tellings us we know how deep this is so appreciate it please that s too bad since macbeth is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film sadly this relatively slow moving production isn t it there are of course wonderful moments with mackellan and particularly dench \( no one plays the scene where lady macbeth goes crazy better than dame judi \) i just don t know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase for my money kurosawa s throne of blood is a far better choice	negative
this dvd was a total disappointment first of all this video was a rip off of baby genius series but without the production value second this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits to be fair there are fruits and vegetables but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals \( grilled turkeys etc \) and rotten milk \( in other term cheese \) chicken period \( eggs \) ice cream \( i think it s a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream \) and other non fruit and non vegetable foods this video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that s bigger than baby s head i believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition i would not recommend this video for vegetarians vegans or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits	negative

this movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment sex drugs beating on people stealing whatever keeps boredom at bay there is no script to speak of just watching them being themselves one kid called telly \( about 15 or 16 \) who has aids \( and may not know it \) likes young virgins \( 12 to 14 year old girls \) he s a predator with no conscience at all probably a sociopath and his buddy casper is a dumb punk who swills beer he s just as bad as telly i have no doubt that teens like this exist they existed back in the 70s when i was a teen i m sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don t have children perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing i m sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too and small towns and even rural areas this movie isn t for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them	positive

to be or not to be is a comedy set during wwii although it makes light of a tense time in history it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease the story revolves around two actors in poland maria and joseph tura joseph \( jack benny \) specializes in overplaying hamlet and maria \( carole lombard \) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his to be or not to be speech the man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation although she is working for the allies a nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess the film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting it is a real shame that carole lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne	positive
st elmo s fire is one of those movies that could have been better should have been better and yet it just wasn t it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s the so called brat pack \( well everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall who were spared this misstep \) maybe this was supposed to be the breakfast club after college but while the breakfast club had characters even stereotypical characters that you could relate to there is absolutely no one with the exception of emilio estevez character that you care enough about to relate to in this film the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois but georgetown where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college uh huh yeah right judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage problem is nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy \( or maybe it s just the pearls \) emilio estevez is a future attorney working as a waiter server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell mare winningham is a dowdy trust fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her she instead fantasizes about rob lowe who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band who has dropped out of school married a white trash y looking groupie had a child with her and has now separated from her and taking up with other groupies demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking has a serious coke problem stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol sounds promising huh well in what is an early portend of the melrose place to come sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is dumps his ass immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job estevez after screwing up a lucrative house sitting job by hosting a party there travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home lowe in between faux playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere takes winningham s virginity and heads back to his estranged missus moore after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother has all her furnishings repossessed loses her job and freaks out not exactly the breakfast club the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves with the exception of estevez character they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped their every action every line of dialogue seems like just that they seem very one dimensional their so called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that winningham s character could have been salvagable except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was and yet she still gave her virginity to him maybe if winningham wasn t so bright or she was a college freshman it would be understandable but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent lowe really had little to do with his role maybe if he had played the role nelson had as the roving lothario with sheedy waiting at home it might have gone over better with his too pretty looks it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him nelson just doesn t seem comfortable and doesn t pull it off but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player moore basically plays herself an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems mirroring her character but was later rehired while the title song later become a minor hit st elmo s fire itself missed the mark	negative

i am a jane austen fan i love pride and prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel however mansfield park is jane austen s most complex and serious novel and on the whole it is my favorite fanny price is the most difficult of the jane austen heroines not the wittiest or most beautiful but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong she is mentored by her uncle the righteous and honorable and i don t use the terms loosely sir thomas bertram somehow the adaptation of this great novel has twisted sir thomas into a sadistic sexual pervert moreover fanny is constantly babbling to us in jane austen quips that are not part of this novel they simply missed the point of the book the acting is okay the settings are okay the directing is sad but the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste	negative
i saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001 but i didn t pay too close attention because i forgot about it however i remembered seeing it in theaters one day when i was browsing the dvd section and decided to give it another shot at home i am so glad i did leelee sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film she has a bright future in acting ahead of her basically what happens is ruby \( sobieski \) and her brother rhett s \( trevor morgan \) parents die in a car accident their parents wished for them to go live with the family s former neighbors the glasses \( who had since moved to malibu \) played by stellan skarsgard and diane lane needless to say ruby and rhett s carefree lives are changed dramatically rhett falls for all the gifts that the glasses buy for him but ruby isn t fooled so easily she begins to suspect that her parents death wasn t an accident and starts to investigate she sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the glasses that only make her more suspicious eventually she figures out that the glasses are behind the car accident and are now after ruby and rhett s 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents i won t give away the rest but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second rent it or better yet buy it it s well worth your while	positive

my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles i moved to echo park in late 2004 it s depressing the vicious cycle of drugs dropping out and domestic violence and it s all here told through the eyes of latina teenagers it was easy to see the woman s hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played i didn t care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven i also found myself not caring about any of the characters so and so gets shot la la loo goes to jail whatever as an aside though the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto it turns out my next door neighbor in real life is also called ernesto luckily it s just a coincidence	negative
francis ford coppola s apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker the art direction editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline acting and inner message the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell or in other words hell is war not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well defined piece of art european filmmakers wouldn t have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film s collaborators through the continuance of the film the plot is fairly simple and brief adapted by joseph conrad s heart of darkness martin sheen plays the role of captain willard a war torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz \( marlon brando \) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks robert duvall s character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself the children walk about the playground oblivious to any danger the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea millions of sprinkle reflect from the water we hear the helicopter s engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack throughout the sequence we hear wagner s ride of the valkyries it is method filmmaking the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing let s not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in stop an innocent upcoming boat suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity this film has its famous moment some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen it doesn t require any intellectual understanding although the film is intellectually remarkable the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against it was a war gone mad like all other wars without purpose or dignity it was a pure act of humanity to destroy and restore their own greedy needs this is a film in which there is no saviour where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed anger foolishness and egoism as coppola once said about the film this film isn t about vietnam this film is vietnam he was right to the date during the current situations of the world where they are trying to protect their own skin the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation it asks for realism enjoy	positive

the print looks like you re watching it through muddy water is this something to do with the unclear public domain status of this and other of capra s works doesn t he have a family that could help out his dvds the way that chaplin s family has done or even to use the opposite extreme the family of edgar ulmer who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies the point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice and all the various dvds of meet john doe are painful to watch we ve heard for years of the re worked ending of the film and that another one exists \( or existed at one time \) bring it on for now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching gary cooper react to barbara stanwyck s pure life it s sort of like ball of fire but a bit more subtle moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two because cooper s slow moving nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to stanwyck s vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion she doesn t even have to speak she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture okay the movie writes itself into a corner for what else is going to happen except that if gary cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it s established with the viewers this has always been doe s problem that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself and it didn t work in 1943 and it still isn t working now it s great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as hollywood tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma	positive
sorry can t finish this garbage movie is this girl retarded or what watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all how and why the garbage collecting turned cow feeder young guy would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer there s no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath the girl didn t look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless what life was too boring then what started becoming natural born killer give me a break bone chilling you can always say that again but won t make me care a bit more	negative
in this movie we once again see mad max \( sans hot car \) wandering around in a post apocalyptic world until he discovers bartertown in the wasteland mel gibson tries valiantly to channel such on screen loners as clint eastwood and john wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social skills however he becomes a threat to the matriarch of the town by the name of aunty emteevee \( or something like that \) then mel kicks a lot of butt in the process this is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the outback opal mining town of coober pedy which i visited a few years ago	positive
awhile ago i was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste such as people who love r b and rap to people who prefer dance in a way texas chainsaw massacre as well as the exorcist and the shining are like the beatles and led zeppelin of horror movies you must love them and say anything different and you re going to get lynched so i will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so called horror movies yet at the same time i wonder why it didn t hit me that much 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses they decide to check it out only no one s home seemingly at first pretty soon they meet leatherface a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw pretty soon the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive it s odd how i can t say any more about the plot not because of spoilers but because there s not a lot else to say like many a filmgoer i can t stand the latest releases in horror instead of using atmosphere pacing and mood to creep people out they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes this film isn t even gory at all in fact the film s goriest scene where one of the kids meets a chainsaw isn t even shown onscreen your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing adding to the realism is that it s shot in a kind of documentary like style one problem i had with the film was that the dread didn t feel there there was pre mtv style editing and extreme closeups of eyeballs and maybe i ve just seen it before but it didn t creep me out like it should ve \( and having a woman scream for 20 minutes doesn t help \) if i saw this in 1974 i mostly likely would ve been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later it s more like yeah it was alright although i better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it if you re a fan go ahead and buy it because it s probably the best release of the film but personally i m not	positive
i am a faithful csi watcher and have been since the shows inception i buy the dvd sets and enjoy them tremendously however there are two trends i see developing that i don t care for one there is too much catherine we know everything about her kid her dead husband her crook father etc and she s really an annoying character she makes nasty comments about everyone she s always being insubordinate she goes out with men half her age \( let s quit trying to make her seem like a young chick when she isn t especially wearing those skin tight jeans \) she is very arrogant and even though she continually screws up \( loses her camera blows up the lab in a previous season accuses people before she has all the evidence \) they made her a supervisor also the plot line with grissom and sara while predictable is not the greatest i think grissom would be better off paired with lady heather there s an idea let s see more of lady heather still even with the annoying overabundance of the least likable character \( catherine \) the show is one of the best if not the best on tv \( up there with without a trace ncis and numbers \) keep em coming	positive
there aren t many films from any era that come close to being perfect \( though that s not really the right word \) in just about every way probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over friendly persuasion is one of those films in spades directed by william wyler and starring gary cooper dorothy mcguire and tony perkins it is a wonderful human story about a loving family of quakers \( also known as friends \) living in one of the union confederate border states at the time of the civil war in the 1860s the cast in small roles and large is uniformly excellent none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them led by beloved legendary star gary cooper in a great performance as the head of the quaker family jess birdwell they are marvelous including child actor richard eyer as feisty little jess scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with samantha his mother eliza birdwell s pet goose who more than carries her end of the feud with scene stealing craftiness there are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements and a hilarious episode in which eldest son josh \( perkins \) accompanies father jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy amorous daughters of one of jess s customers \( marjorie main \) we are settled into a lovely lively exploration of the birdwell family s idyllic existence then the war intrudes josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to even though it is against the teachings of his faith his younger sister loves a young union officer who is soon to go into battle rebel troops are nearing the region where they live and no one including the audience quite knows what will happen there is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young josh gets his first taste of battle which perkins performs with heartbreaking realism i recall my father a world war ii veteran saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man s first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies when it is all over and the birdwells return to their quiet hard working loving life as a family the music \( dimitri tiomkin s marvelous score \) swells the wonderful lyrics to the song friendly persuasion are sung sweetly by the young pat boone and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times the story has been told with integrity honesty humanity gentle humor kind restraint and yes love all of these also attributes of the birdwell family that we have come to know that is the genius of this film along with a very few others it shows us who we are who we can be and how we can live all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic and the film never ever loses its balance it s just a great and good movie i ve seen it almost a dozen times and it can still move me to tears i m betting it could be released today amid the ridiculously over budgeted badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma and that it would clean up at the box office the term family values has been kicked around a lot lately and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it watch this truly beautiful film and you ll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words	positive

i saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re release and subsequently on dvd i can readily attest that it does not age i m not even a dog person myself but the plot is not about dogs per say but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named lady has living with owners named darling and jim dear lady apparently leads a pretty good life assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy she is later shocked to meet tramp who lives on the streets however she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior she needs his help when crusty old aunt sarah comes to mind the house and the newborn baby initially not understanding that lady feels protective towards the baby she also selectively ignores the damage which her two siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate victorian house amazingly aunt sarah presumes that lady was responsible for wrecking the house and attempts to muzzle her up like any streetwise character tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up however he does not come across as an annoying know it all who you would want to quickly get rid of tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments lady had gentle friends named jock and trusty but they can t help out in a world also outside of their own of course the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time it made a very profound impact on me well before i was even old enough to myself consider dating i imagined that i would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own mr right however tramp s decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene he then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than lady but saved the baby anyway tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars tramp ultimately gets adopted by the darlings therefore he and lady do in fact live happily ever after	positive

a review by the students in ent 201 insects on film \( clemson university clemson sc \) spring 2005 when better to meet your new man than while saving the world from giant radioactive grasshoppers that s what happened to audrey ames in beginning of the end the black and white movie produced in 1957 takes place in a small illinois town called ludlow near the big city of chicago the main character audrey is a persistent reporter who discovers a new and interesting story on her way to write about a lackluster flying demonstration on her way to the flying demo she is stopped at a roadblock in the town of ludlow illinois it seems that the town has been mysteriously destroyed overnight following a lead audrey goes to the u s department of agriculture and meets with the project director named dr ed wainwright in order to find out more about what happened dr wainwright tells audrey about a wheat factory that was demolished in the same area before the destruction of ludlow ed audrey and ed s co worker frank go to investigate the abandoned grain bins while they are there a locust comes from the woods and eats ed s co worker they finally realize what is destroying the towns and eating the people although it s a little too late for poor frank johnson determined to resolve the problem the military enlists the help of dr wainwright who tries to find a sound frequency that mimics the sound grasshoppers make before they attack the viewer of this film will be held in utter suspense until at a climatic moment dr wainwright discovers the right frequency and saves the city of chicago from the military s impending drop of an atom bomb the sound is broadcast from a boat in a lake outside of chicago and the sound attracts the grasshoppers to the lake as the grasshoppers follow the luring sound they eventually end up in the lake where they meet a watery death the city of chicago is safe and everyone lives happily ever after \( except sadly those who were eaten alive by the radioactive grasshoppers \) while this movie has extremely entertaining moments such as when the grasshoppers scale the skyscrapers of chicago looking for food the movie in general is a b attempt at science fiction also the movie was produced during the 1950s resulting in minimal attempts at realistic special effects the special effects are entertaining at best and add humor more than substance to the movie the viewer also might be left with several questions after watching this movie like why can t the national guard protect the citizens from grasshoppers or why is it more funny than tragic when dr wainwright s deaf mute assistance gets eaten alive by a grasshopper on a scientific or scholarly level the movie has several errors the most important error in the entomological sense is the noise that the grasshoppers make throughout the movie to make the noise that they did in the movie they would need wings in the movie though the characters say that the grasshoppers could not fly because they didn t have wings also the scientist indicates that the giant vegetables were produced through radioactivity which allows for photosynthesis to occur both day and night for photosynthesis to occur light must be present thus raising the question of how the vegetables could continue to expand during the darkness of night the inability of the grasshoppers to burn in the fires set by the military reflects an error as well in reality grasshoppers are highly flammable because of their wax like coating finally the plot as a whole is completely unrealistic and so bizarre that the movie should be placed in the comedy \( opposed to science fiction \) genre while clemson university research may have led to the evacuation of mole crickets from golf course greens using technological concepts similar to those presented in the movie the likelihood that radioactive grasshoppers would eat hundreds of people is improbable beginning of the end is an amusing movie to watch the acting is traditional of the sci fi movies of the era the special effects are mediocre but the humor in retrospect is delightful if you are a fan of cheesy sci fi suspense movies give this flick a try you will not be disappointed who knows maybe you ll learn something that could save the world the next time we are attacked by radioactive bugs	negative

this is a surprisingly poor movie although it has some well known actors and a notable director the material was just presented badly and predictably like a lousy late night tv movie with profanity inserted to liven it up the movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings \( though legitimate in many cases \) it also glosses over the grieving process of the family ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child overdoes kiefer sutherland s character flaws \( which are considerable nevertheless \) and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title in one particularly bad scene after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically sally s character simply stares open mouthed and dumbfounded at keifer s character when they meet on the street and he talks to her i don t know what i missed that the 4 and 5 star reviewers like so much i only see wide spread mediocrity i would only recommend this for fans of keifer ssssssorry sally not your best role or movie ditto ed harris whose other movies i generally like	negative

with the straight story lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love this film felt like a blind date gone bad the straight story showed up david lynch arrived but the rest of the date felt muddled confusing and utterly disastrous everything in this film seemed wrong lynch s choice for lead actor the bland sissy spacek the filler of repeat cornfield montages all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read i just felt that nobody had control over this picture yet the randomness \( and the possible tear ending \) gave critics something to smile about this is not a david lynch film and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive twin peaks or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois it just seemed repetitive and boring what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose alvin lying on the ground because he can t get up the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame spacek s depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors then to add more fuel to the fire there was richard farnsworth again he isn t a horrible actor but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically but alas couldn t master it mentally farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen i couldn t tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime i saw it as babble \( and no i am not that insensitive i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger more professional actor \) the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant i wanted lynch to either go 100 for this film or none at all but alas it felt as if he just half ed his way through this heap speaking of david lynch where did he go in this film there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns looking at america class i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film instead of keeping us by alvin s side throughout his journey lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while but when the same images were used over and over again i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin but the stock footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way alvin was a walking storybook filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well lynch made alvin very closed minded which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature alvin was a strong character but i needed more with this story i wanted him to make choices learn new things and bring that to his brother s table when they eventually met i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin and not vice versa overall i wasn t stunned by this picture i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just played it safe the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin speaking of alvin why couldn t he have been a stronger better rounded character i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america but instead gave us nothing more than soft music recycled images and stock characters the stories were interesting to listen to but brought nothing fresh to the table i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye \( since i have a brother as well \) but why couldn t we focus on this further lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan when it was the central focus of this film the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch but instead it felt jagged and old i could suggest one viewing for this film any further and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be grade out of	negative
i bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and i was very disappointed first off it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music but the background exercisers really bug me too not only that the moves are strange she does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music i found my neck hurt a lot after that the leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself the ab section too was so old school i was hoping to find some new exercises i love karen voight but this dvd was definately the worst i have yet to purchase of hers all the other karen voight i own i absolutely love	negative
title intuos3 tablet publisher wacom publish date unknown isbn model ptz631w reviewer robert saucier rating 5 stars in 1997 after buying a new top of the line 450mhz pentium ii system i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet oh my pressure sensitive tilt sensing pointer control assignable function pads it was heaven after a couple of years every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application my computer would spontaneously reboot a bit counter productive i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but as technology marched on my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats sadly i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away lately i ve been feeling the pull once more that urge to use a pen to do photo touch ups instead of my mouse miraculously a wacom intuos3 6 inch by 11 inch tablet dropped almost literally into my lap sleek gun metal gray sexy with a comfort grip pen \( much like my coveted pilot g2 pens \) and a mouse even better the intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities adobe elements 4 0 corel painter essentials 3 and nik color efex 2 0 le heaven just got better the intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution over twice that of the wacom graphire product line and with its usb 2 connection there s more than enough communication bandwidth meaning better tablet to application response one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else the intuos3 driver has been rock solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me i ve used all of my usual programs and have had no problems at all the tablet has also been peacefully co existing with two external drives a wireless desktop receiver a card reader a scanner and a printer all riding the same usb bus the intuos3 has 8 chordable buttons 4 at each side of the tablet to which keys macros or other actions may be assigned the default for each group are the usual alt ctrl command and shift along with space the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet holding one or more of the buttons while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand being chordable you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt ctrl s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context the ends of the strip in keystroke mode can be set to playback macros the pen with its 1024 level pressure sensitive stylus and eraser also has a duoswitch the duoswitch s two positions may also be programmed the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback with the ergonomic grip the pen is extremely comfortable to hold the 5 button mouse designed to be used by either righties or lefties is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility this is more than acceptable as with every other clickable pressable feature associated with the intuos3 the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options although i ve yet to find the fix photo illustrate article or even the design website settings i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already this feature would be the feather on the cap to me the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire \( and was on the artz ii \) sometimes having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time for the casual home user i would recommend the graphire product line this intuos3 model s srp of 369 may be a bit high where a 99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable for the pro consumer or professional however whether doing photo editing \( my primary use \) or illustration the intuos3 line is well worth the investment it s great to be in heaven again	positive
when it worked it did as described but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it there are many better more reliable brands such as the sony micro vault which i have now nevertheless i wouldn t put anything on these that i didn t have backed up these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer heat will cause them to fail faster	negative
after the last panasonic 4 line debacle 1 key failes in 6 months on all handsets yikes and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the panasonic phone how bad could it be we figured they have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now well the handset is probably ok but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1 what called panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery for heaven s sake hang up call back next person educates me that 5 8 ghz just means clearer signal but range is shorter wtf we immediately boxed this piece of junk up and sent it back do yourself a favor buy from a different manufacturer	negative
these headphones sound pretty good but they aren t the best when running the volume controller gets in the way and bounces it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange i realize it is done intentionally but it does nothing for me overall for just listening at your desk or in your room these are great headphones for running i would recommend something else	positive
i am very happy with my meridian color and the other mapsend products i have purchased however at first i couldnt get this product to work i had no problem getting this software to run with xp \( even without the patch \) however i couldnt view the basemap i had loaded onto my magellan i tried to address this with the company it has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails customer service for this product is nonexistant i joined the yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer turns out i just had to go to the menu card utilities and maunually select the basemap i did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do i cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though navigating through hungary like a pro i didnt miss a single turn i would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it the magellan meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps get you head out of your a thales you have some great products but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support i recommend anyone with a question about softward or the gps join the yahoo groups and post the question there dont waste your time with customer support	negative

the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer be sure to understand this before you buy so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it think again the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality not at least not on premium quality photo paper perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore this is hint 1 hint 2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol the only option you have is to order the ink online trust amazon as they can find and deliver however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges cartridges certainly dont last very long and at 12 15 each with eight of them your burning 100 125 a set bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you however at 850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper i haven t been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon amazon s being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here	negative

this product looks and feels very flimsy do not be fooled by the flashy metallic looking picture the plastic shell of this device is the quality of mcdonald s toys one would think that for 300 the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting the buttons are hard to press in order to turn the device on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell the cable port for the docupen is also extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connection will be lost i am a pre medical student and i very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product believing that i could \( for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk \) scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way i thought i would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each however i now see that this belief was naive to say the least the docupen is extremely difficult to use the words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free paper port software which comes complimentary with the docupen is rather useful for annotating pdf s the docupen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate furthermore downloading is very slow \( at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer \) and since you can t see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to re scan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility i wish i had read some of the other negative amazon reviews before buying this product i would have saved myself a lot of money and time if you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital camera will probably deliver better results if you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all out paperless with this product you will find yourself extremely disappointed until planon decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi decent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy the idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a tablet pc however the execution of the idea needs improvement i hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality	negative
i bought this item because amazon never had the 3m model i wanted in stock so i settled for this one that was a big mistake the wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu it is really a two person operation finally if your cpu has a side access panel you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer take a look at the 3m cs100 stand i think it is a much better design	negative

no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter the way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i did confirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie	negative

just a note to those who ve been having trouble opening these cases without breaking them if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together you ll be able to open and close it ok don t sand too much and just do the top knob or it won t hold together i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive so i wanted to make them work hope it works for you	positive

this printer is a piece of junk the print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges the mechanism is likrly to be damaged like other hp printers operating under xp it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem \( e g paper jam paper out \) cancelling a print job results in a deleting document message which remains until printer is disconnected \( you can turn it off under these circumstances \) and computer is rebooted often xp hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering i have long had this problem with an older hp model but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now but alas the crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge the tricolor cartridge costing about 18 at wal mart lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up in sumarry don t buy this printer whatever the price it would probably be wise to avoid hp inexpensive printers altogether	negative

after using my im716s for about 4 months now i have a few things to say about them 1 \) price lists for 199 on altec s site 70 is a steal 2 \) quality top notch in the earphones the clip on the volume module is weak 3 \) performance bar none best i ve had these things outperform the huge logitech ear muff set i use mainly to mow in these things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower 4 \) conclusion the only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way when moving around you need to have it clipped to something otherwise it can create inner ear noise this can get quite annoying i ve also caught the cord on things causing the clip to bend away from the module it is removeable and i was able to bend it back if there were a pair of equal quality w o the module even for the same price i d go that route with that said i am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60gb video ipod	positive

first of all i am a dyed in the wool techie i design products like this in my job i know what every single one of those what the heck is that settings in router set up screens are so i do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many \( most \) who have had trouble with this router morons yes i got it to work it will work right out of the box if used with most pre n wireless cards and definitely if they are linksys pre n cards that covers about 1 of those who would buy this router after three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default i succeeded in getting it to hand shake with b and g mode cards most of the time it would still randomly lose the ip requiring rebooting everything not something my customer would accept nor would i sell some of the techie specs are a long way from what linksys claims linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both they failed a non techie spec important to everyone is range it has 20 the range of an old b mode linksys router i had sitting right next to it adding encryption dropped range in half again the wired router portion of it works out of the box no adjustments required but you re buying this for the wireless function yes i could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with but linksys didn t used to be that way i used to buy only linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware this is the third linksys router in a month \( the other two were g mode \) that have been unstable or doa then why did i buy this one it was on sale and i wanted to give linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good they ve now lost it for good i exchanged the router for a netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards plus it was a lot less money has cisco ruined linksys got me did all the good engineers cash out i wouldn t be surprised are they rushing unfinished bug filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for wall street you bet i ll stick with netgear and belkin from now on	negative

i bought this enclosure about 1 year ago i put a 200gb hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated itunes library it was a super easy setup many complain in the other reviews that it s a tight fit inside but i didn t find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in after connecting the hard drive and closing it up i simply connected it via firewire to my mac g4 and it worked like a charm next month i will have it for 1 year and i would be 100 happy with it if not for one thing the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on arghh all of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time every so often the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes but it always returns with a vengence otherwise the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year i m definitly going to get rid of it though once i find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable but not nearly as noisy it s a shame actually since i m in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my aperture library and data backup respectively	positive
it works fine but it gets really annoying when you re using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16 9 aspect ratio whereas macs are at 16 10 aspect ratio so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you re trying to display or have massive letter boxing after three months i still haven t had any glitches that were this adapter s fault if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector don t bother with this go straight to dvi with a mini dvi to dvi adapter then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord	positive
i purchased 16 of the allsop 26625 dvd vhs organizers after i had 4 or 5 of them on the floor loaded with dvds i was going to move them to load the next batch but when i picked them up off the floor two of them came apart dropping the dvds on the floor knowing they were weak i tried to hold the next one together but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners the other two corners gave way and my hands came together scattering dvds all over the floor looking at the pieces that came apart i saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece but the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the dvds facing upward and they were the same on all 16 boxes i emailed the manufacturer \( from whom i had bought 12 of the boxes \) and asked since it would be time consuming for me to send them back and costly for them what would they offer me if i just kept them and glued the corners together i had absolutely no response i ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them i think they will be ok now but i would not have purchased them if i knew they were so poorly manufactured and i do not have any good thoughts about allsop s customer service	negative

i had read several reviews here before purchasing this product but went ahead and bought it anyway thinking that logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted i was wrong after a few weeks of satisfactory use \( long enough to get past amazon s reasonable window for returns \) the space bar started working intermittently incredibly annoying and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes even before the space bar turned against me i was unimpressed with the feel of the keys \( i use a dell wireless keyboard an apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my ibm x series laptop \) bottom line the thing looks great on a desk and it is nicely compact but it probably won t do what you need it to look elsewhere	negative
man were we diappointed with this ge phone we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we couldn t figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a 10 year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it s unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere	negative

this is an awesome little device let me start with the pros 1 \) easy incredibly easy setup \( literally press one button never believed it but it s true plug in the usb transmitter press the blue button voila \) 2 \) good sound for a small set of speakers these things sound great they are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system but sound very good and comparable to a 45 two speaker set of monitor side speakers there s a built in sub woofer that helps as well 3 \) wireless range with 4 aa batteries you can carry this little guy around your whole house and outside your house reception is great i am used to bluetooth headsets that don t really work much further than 10 feet from the phone i had doubts about bluetooth speakers but i am amazed with reception these guys have 4 \) controls the forward reverse pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both media player or yahoo music engine running on the laptop \( the only two i tried \) again i was surprised but they worked flawlessly 5 \) cool as far as cool factor this little guy is definitely that cons 1 \) no remote it would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound ff rw pause play controls 2 \) no control from pc you can t control the sound \( or mute \) from the laptop only from the speakers 3 \) sound above i said the sound was good and it is considering the size of this system however these are small speakers and a mini sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too it s good but it s not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system there is base but not a great deal you definitely won t feel the music with these speakers 4 \) volume volume is limited it s enough to fill a mid sized room but not much more for 100 this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with no wires carry it to your kid s room to the garage to the basement no wires nothing if convenience is and portability is important to you and if medium sound quality is ok then i would highly recommend this speaker system it s great personally i m not sure if i m going to keep them because i would really like fuller sound \( this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room \) and more base but they re so cool and convenient that i doubt i ll be able to give them up for other bluetooth ideas and wi fi network options see my post at the hydrogen audio forum	positive

i must admit i read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive however i found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items i ve tried so far i initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time \( before reading the instructions \) this made things more difficult so i started over set it for everything to be automatic including the time left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its thing which it did magnificently everything worked beautifully and it did a great job i love the one touch recording i found it s best to read directions one at a time as i want to try something new and have had no problems so far i haven t tried everything it will do but find it s very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use it s a joy to hit the tvguide button highlight the shows i want to watch and hit the record button so far i have no complaints	positive

not only was this difficult to set up \( even a generally polite but sadly ill informed technical helper from belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases \) but once i finally managed to get it to work \( by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip \) it had practically no range whatsoever in fact my macbook pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75 signal and once the threshold of the room was crossed the signal disappeared altogether a free four year old linksys router which i received with my earthlink home networking package \( and which this belkin was supposed to replace \) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed and linksys is supposed to be notoriously mac unfriendly anyway i hope that there are enough ups trucks in america to handle the returns that this item mine included will require	negative

i originally bought my daughter an ilive ibcd3816dt boombox for her birthday the hiss was unbearable so i took it back and purchased this product much better quality control and it docks perfectly with her 2gb ipod nano using the supplied insert very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone it sounds great looks good and the controls are very intuitive	positive
i have this setup with my new laptop that runs vista premium the device installs ok and it works with media center it s great for watching tv but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in standby mode until it s time to record you may be disappointed when coming out of standby sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not when it s not recognized i have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized because of this i have missed several recordings i contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby	negative

consider another receiver before buying delorme s delorme s receiver works only with their software \( the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers \) the delorme software itself is not very accurate just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme s software sometimes is unable to find it \( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesn t seem to accomplish much \) real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages	negative
having had very good luck with two belkin g routers i thought that the g would be a no brainer not first of all the router would not install at all from windows 2000 i called customer support and after interminable waits and two tech support people \( who were very polite \) we finally decided to install from another computer with windows xp all seemed to be going along fine the router installed but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set up process like their g router setups did only when i logged on wirelessly it let me set a password meaning had any of my bandwidth thieving neighbors tried to log on before me it would have been them setting my password \( which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless \) it also came without a user s guide \( though that is listed on the box contents \) and the cd rom also was supposed to have a user s manual but when i clicked on the user manual tab nothing came up after all was said and done i did manage to get my xp system connected but the windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable \( it was working fine on a linksys direct cable before \) overall a very painfully long installation that was not windows 2000 compatible \( or perhaps a firewall problem \) items left out of the package and a big step down in ease of installation from their g router and if that isn t bad enough the signal strength was no improvement over the linksys g router i was replacing belkin sorry this product was below your previous standard this one s going back to best buy	negative
this cd dvd holder is sturdy and stylish i needed something to look nice but hold my stuff and those wallet type options weren t really cutting it for me i had also purchased something similiar \( not case logic \) from another store and was unimpressed by how flimsy it was i now have 4 or 5 of these and they look great all lined up i plan on getting more as needed when they get full it still stays sturdy and fits in the holder \( the other one i purchased ballooned out and had to be forced to get it in \) the only con i can think of is the price for me it s worth it but that may not be the case for you if there are budget constraints	positive
when it works it does extend the range however every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again the pc is not assigned an ip number unplug this extender and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly connected pcs i purchased this particular d link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di 624 router i wasted my money buying this device it s useless and it s too light to even serve as a door stop	negative
this cartridge is very light easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality durable black ink on the page it is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that s great \( it even comes with an expiration date \) hp also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit one thing that i didn t like however is that the ink can go quickly if you print a lot you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so my needs are about 20 pages per week and i have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks that s not good although to be fair to this hp ink cartridge i am printing graphics four stars \( well maybe three and one half stars \) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge it loses points for not lasting longer	positive

i was pretty excited about this player having read about it in runners world there are a lot of problems with it however while it is advertised as a sports mp3 player in a lot of respects it isn t very convenient for someone who buys it for sports my issues are headphones are not at all appropriate for sports particularly running they keep falling off so i had to invest in a better pair of headphones kind of weird since it s supposed to be a sports player also i spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them hard to change music while running and it often ends up doing something i don t want it to you can t change the music without removing the mp3 player from the armband which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can t tell from any picture not easy to figure out the features of the player such as the stopwatch pedometer also hard to use once you do figure it out software is a pain to use organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player that being said i still use it there are some good features long battery life recharges super quick very cool looking player very easy to carry around can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size i would not recommend this player and if given a choice i would not buy it again	negative
i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough	negative

like others i was very pleased \( initially \) with the very quick installation of this router since i am very familiar with linksys products working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap i was up an running inside 5 minutes signal strength was awesome and i had an imac connected wirelessly with wpa security and an xp machine connected through the ethernet port life was good after a few days of blissful surfing i tried to connect a mac powerbook pro to the network bad idea would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely \( another bad idea \) after resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable the imac now loses it s connection every 15 minutes or so soooooo once again i m resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land i purposely stayed with 802 11g because this technology is several years old and should be rock solid i found a forum at that proved to me that many others are having dhcp problems with these routers there s no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network if i hadn t already tossed the box i would be returning it for a refund	negative

it works the antenna isnt junk either i am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk i also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area \( chicagoland \) problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable so i cant watch those on my mac its not supposed to be a cable tuning box just digital stuff so its fine i just thought it did that as well next thing to do is get a bigger better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable \( as i only watch a couple stations anyways \) eyetv works cytv with it works great make sure you go and donate to that opensource project	positive
this cable looks nice when you don t linger on a digital channel what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight the next day it will be a split screen mode showing double image of the broadcast to fix it i have to change it to a non digital channel and switch it back i guess it is possible that it is the cable box but nothing happens like that on the component outputs	negative

i purchased one of these just shy of three years ago \( feb 2003 \) i have taken very good care of it \( it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use \) and used it several times a week while i teach over time the silver finish wore off around the on button \( apparently from perspiration from my hand \) exposing the copper underneath last week the button froze in the on position so it is now effectively useless the laser diode still works however also the company offers geek points for future purchases that are supposed to be good for 36 months i checked the site earlier this week and while it s now only been 35 months the ones i earned from this purchase are no longer on record	negative

i ve rarely had bad experiences with microsoft mice or keyboards usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product they evidently didn t hire the good designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults 1 the shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever this causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it you never get the feeling that your hand is in the right position 2 the side buttons are in brain dead locations why this is i have no idea as other microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly \( the way it should be \) on this gaming mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it couple this with problem 1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn t intend to just what you don t want when throwing a grenade the right button is sort of click able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button but it feels more due to luck than planning i have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street i give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord and it looks visually appealing calling this a gaming mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of rating not recommended	negative

i have purchased over two dozen of these units this is the best unit for the price there are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit this allows you to be certain that your feed is being input also the card slots are a plus two things to be aware of if you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in also if you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required not a one disc does all unit	positive

i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered this receiver does have a number of good features but has one serious flaw it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations like volume and sound mode unless you have a pioneer display and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv \( as a side note pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display \) that means you only get to see the simple set up screen on your non pioneer tv which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver and very infrequently after that \( the set up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs and audio calibtraion \) sounds like a small deal but in many home theaters including mine the electronics are not in the line of site \( mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything \) this not uncommon many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors and it means i have no idea what the volume is what sound mode i am using or anything beyond the set up menu unless i go into the closet bad bad bad this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv s and projectors and it is beyond stupid if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher but it is a serious flaw it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult this limitation also means if you have mulitple displays i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater you need to run thier special cable to both displays and both have to be pioneer again i have to say bad bad bad the other features are as stated on the pioneer website but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems unless they have a pioneer display with sr \( oh yeah your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr thier way of linking the two units if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr you are again out of luck did i mention this is bad \) 25 feb 2007 addition to reveiw i called onecall and they will take unit back but at 15 restocking fee plus paying for shipping both ways while onecall really did nothing wrong \( pioneer is lying about the osd \) it is one of thier vendors and not the customer s fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud buyer beware from onecall thier customer service on this one was not good	negative
this vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad s new tracheostomy problem is it puts out too much mist even at the lowest setting we ve tried everything including taping the hole but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through of course it wasn t until we started mentioning it to the various rn s that come to take care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem so i ve resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad s mask not a great way to do it \( and just asking to be seeded by bacteria \) but if anyone has a better suggestion i m all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier	negative
when i got my hands on the pmc 120 i thought this was going to to be the best player but when i started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way i agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation device feel to it music when i tried to put music in my pmc it syncronized my mp3s with the wmp 10 with no problem \( very fast \) if u are looking for a grab and drop \( copy paste \) your music mp3 device this is not for you because when i did it got everything in one same folder that read unknown artist and album so you have to put all your mp3s via wmp 10 wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast the problems that i encountered is that it only has one portable playlist and sometimes when im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button one cool thing is that it shows the cd covers without having to put them in this is done via the wmp10 the sound is very good and crisp and the equalizer setups are fair but you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound pictures this is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders you can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a pc to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you video ok now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me i wanted a portable media device that i would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid i knew that this device only reads wmv but it supports divx xvid mpeg etc this support deppends on what the wmp10 can play so this means that you sincronyze \( via wmp10 \) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into wmp movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your pmc secreen size i had this in mind when i bought it and was fine with me untill i tried it the first time the wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that i had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the wmp10 so after uninstalling and installing i was good to go so i converted a 1 45hr long movie in only 25 minutes but this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the wmp10 fits the widescreen movies into the pmc and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable you cant change this because the wmp does this automatically my answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into wmv files the problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert i have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the wmp10 in the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the wmp10 and it does it very fast and with good quality you can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so i think this option is useless on the pmc so the veredict is the pmc 120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches it is a little bulky but personally i think the size is not that big i think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3 6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video if you want to play directly your divx or xvid movies on your player buy another porduct like the iriver pmp series or the archos players wich are way way way more expensive so i think that for the price and for what it does the pmc 120 gets two thumbs up	positive

these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed i bought them in may and they broke after 2 3 and 4 months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty \( this is 1 year \) and higher quality components	negative
a lot of tv for little money great picture and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end lcd s initial setup can be tricky because olevia chose to include a cd version of the operators manual though you can print a paper version from the cd or olevia website better than average sound but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width after tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many lcd s if you re using it in a bedroom you ll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on off light on the front panel rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible and wall hanging was a breeze looked at many lcd televisions and there are better choices for sure but it s hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price highly satisfied	positive

this was the worst electronics puchase i ve ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about 6 months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing didn t work properly would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes if you re going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one	negative

i agree with the prior review of these jbl e10s however i d go to the e20s for a small room main stereo set better bass worth the slight price increase bought for rear channel \( rc \) use i find the e10s quite airy with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main e30s i just bought from a com \( see my 5 star review \) giving extremely open and detailed surround rc performance note the specs listed on a com for the e10s state bi wireable yes but unless jbl has just changed the terminals to do this that s wrong mine have just a single terminal set and don t bother with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories \( unless you plan ceiling installs \) as they come with two slide down screw slots attached to the back for wall installation surfing for the best price i bought mine refurbished from for a low 53 00 bid plus 18 00 s h directly from jbl and you may find the e30s e20s from jbl as refurbs there as well as rc speakers especially at the price i got them i recommend them highly well deserving the 5 star rating given	positive
why would anyone get this type of charger for about 40 you can get an isupercharger that you can plug into the wall plug into a car lighter plug into a usb port or run off of a 9 volt battery with the 9 volt battery option you can use your ipod all you want even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping it s a small all in one design i don t want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when i take my ipod along	negative

i purchased the md781 md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681 i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets \( everyone online offline was constantly out of stock \) overall i m disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone handheld phones i like them more than any other phone i ve tried unlike most phones these days they re big and have a very solid feel to them it s just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation the buttons are a nice size and easy to use the hands free speak phone on the handheld works well with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it s hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better it s a few clicks and slow to access almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand or copy the number to the local units phonebook which defeats the purpose as for the answer machine once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages if any are in the system \( is it just me or is that poor design \) so if you listen to messages when you partner isn t around you need to leave a note for them to check messages the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy i also like how the handset docked in the older m681 it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk	negative
i live in an apartment building and play \( well practice is a better word \) the bass guitar and needed headphones so i wouldn t bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs tv about 6 feet from where i sit and play the 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing so i wouldn t have to use an extention cable \( and usualy end up with feedback distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable \) the volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so i don t have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings i like to use when not using headphones makes it real nice too when using an instructional cd or dvd i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head very light weight some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them bobble heads fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere cord enters headphones on the left ear side so you don t have to deal with the classic y split cord easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way earpices fit nicly over my ears \( no pinching gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear \) and does a very nice job blocking out noise \( when my wife is awake she watchs the tv rather loudly which is right next to me and i bairly notice it \) plenty of padding around the ear pieces many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear but these headphones i honestly don t feel anything against my ears even after several hours of use each night sound quality bose or pioneer they are not but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn t be shopping in the 20 and under headphones \) that being said they are very good for sound sounded very good on a portable cd player only drawbacks i can see is that a person with large tall ears won t get thier ears covered by the earpads the inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1 4 inchs tall by 1 3 4 imo they could have been made bigger also if you have a tall head \( good distance from top of head to ear \) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears i have a head like drew carry \( give you an idea head size shape i m talking about \) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn t have fit i wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don t interfere bind pinch or anything like that with my glasses so i highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after \( i don t recomend things often \) \)	positive
first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones always pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel	negative

i ve purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters one of them was on an older dell laptop installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a linksys wrt54g router with wap encryption the problems really started showing when i tried to install the second and third adapters both on desktop computers running windows xp sp2 the software installation was a breeze but when i plugged in the adapter nothing happened connect to network which network scan who what it looks like this adapter has a very very short range and doesn t work very well a wall or two in between the routers it would see the router and connect to drop the connection and not find one but then it would find it again and on and off never really worked as expected on the desktops so i ve given up i ve had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times downloaded the updated software from belkin s site and still have connection issues with the desktops the laptop works fine as long as i don t take it one room away from the router avoid at all costs please i ve used other wireless devices with the same router that i m trying to connect and they work fine a few rooms away and all spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing good luck	negative

pro compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket yet opens to a comfortable working size with full sized keys including a number row for those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets this is decidedly a deal maker over the stowaway keyboard which requires alt key combinations to access numbers and symbols the full size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the freedom keyboard to my knowledge there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has both full size keys and a number symbol row the bluetooth connection is clean lag free and accurate con the software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement \( see below \) flimsy locking mechanism not usable on a lap the manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat while on your lap or on a non flat surface this lock is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip which travels 7 8 along the top of the board from the left half into the right even when locked the keyboard doesn t lay flat and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user s legs held in place only by one thin piece of wire the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated v shape after any amount of light handed typing hp could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics a user must find a solid flat surface to type on such as a book and of course when sitting on a flat surface the lock isn t needed the manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your pocketpc unfortunately the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non removable cradle a quick look at the freedom keyboard s pull out cradle offers hp a lesson in how to do it right the keyboard ships with no case as do most other portable keyboards with non rugged exteriors the attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys it doesn t turn off yes you read that last bullet correctly you can t turn this thing off there s no power switch the button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld it s not a power switch what this means is even when folded and not in use even when appearing to be dormant and even when the software shows that there s no bluetooth connection the keyboard is still eating your batteries the automatic sleep mode simply disables the wireless connection it does not power down the keyboard two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard you ll return to find them dead not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes the only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries the battery cover need i add breaks easilly sound unbelievable go to the major websites dedicated to pocketpcs and do a search of their forums using the keywords bluetooth keyboard this is not a case of a know nothing customer who needs to read the manual the manual such as it is makes no mention of an absent power switch for the mobile user then in addition to the keyboard itself one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired to carry the batteries separately and to re enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use the hp ipaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1 3 it s 100 retail price and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full size keys and number row how hp ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me all potential buyers of ipaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what if any emphasis hp places on quality of design and the integrity of ipaq name it reflects also the degree of respect hp has for the intelligence of their customers one might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non removable cradle or the parsimony of not including a case one might even forgive the useless locking mechanism but when hp is either too dumb to include an on off switch or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care then i must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the ipaq name if hp is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for 100 then i cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a pocketpc for 300 400 my next handheld upgrade i ll probably stay with fujitsu siemens loox \( i currently use a loox720 a truly excellent ppc \) or maybe go with a dell axim i won t even consider an ipaq the hp bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality those at hp responsible for protecting public perception of the ipaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves	negative
this router has worked great for the past year we have 3 linux computers connected to dsl through it one pc is at the far end of the house we use two novatech powerline ethernet adapters to connect that pc to the netgear router through our home powerline wiring netgear and novatech work fine together with no dsl speed degredation the browser interface is easy to use the firewall features are easy enough for the inexpert user to understand the manual is good but i would prefer to have a hard copy	positive

i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go	positive
malfunctions 1 the port for connecting to a pc became loose and unreliable frequently disconnecting while i was trying to transfer music 2 the little knob stopped working properly it was no longer possible to fast forward 3 finally the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything design issues it would be nice to be able to access music by id3 tag \( i e artist genre song title \) it takes a long time to start up generally 20 seconds but up to 2 minutes if you just changed the music on it it s nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again however the interface to do this was so inconvenient \( including audio playback stopping and long lag times \) that i rarely used this feature in practice the earbuds that come with it didn t stay in my ears well i bought new ones good things i loved the fact that it had an fm radio and a voice recorder \( the reasons that i bought it \) it s easy to access the hard drive from any computer without any software needed the large storage capacity proved fully necessary you can change playback modes with a single button press \( shuffle versus ordered all songs versus current folder only \) my basis for comparison i ve also owned a creative zen jukebox \( which i liked a lot but which i sold because i wanted the fm radio and voice recorder on the iaudio \) and currently a used fourth generation ipod which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks	negative

i had great hope for this product it has mostly so far lived up to my expectations here are some caveats i was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories easy listening dinner music light jazz etc you have to cheat to do this and using the manual is daunting instead of using the artist as artist i used it as a catagory code ie making one artist light jazz etc this works but you do of course lose the artist registration ability so now i can select artist dinner music and then all discs and shuffle and the unit will play a track from one dinner music cd then shuffle to another track on another dinner music cd etc making a delightful mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way i am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine so longetivty and flawlessness are not being reviewed here that remains to be seen the manual is purely awfull just dig in and try things that s the only way to get a handle on things hope this helps good luck	positive
i bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new hp dv2000 laptop with internal bluetooth i was excited about the instant view feature and the lazer percision however when i got the mouse connected it worked but no instant viewer turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the dongle pluged in but the reason i bought a bluetooth mouse was in order to avoid a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop on top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are awkwerd to press i have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them nothing like my old microsoft mouses cozy side button the middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three which is set to activate the amazing instant viewer which is decent but useless without the dongle as far as lazer percision not too noticable my kingston rf lazer mouse seemed to preform better the only reason i gave it a 2 5 is the charger is nice the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish which feels nice and cool against the palm this makes a decent desktop mouse if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice not something i d recomend for a laptop user for the price overall subpar	negative

i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all 4 500 of them are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd s the player just wouldn t read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer service tech department of any computer electronic company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a 3rd or 4th language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can t believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2 3 days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don t plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1 2gb file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up 7 1gb after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i don t like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because 1 it plays all my music 2 they have a customer service tech support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff	negative
i love this item we bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation it can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van the boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it i was glad about that i d recommend this item	positive
i bought this mount for a philips 42 plasma tv the tv weighs probably about 100lbs i thought the price for it was ok but i don t know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts the mount was put on our living room wall by a handy man because i didn t have a stud finder he was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic the mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured the 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the tv sits a little high but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house the room for the input cables is a little small and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven t noticed any degradation in the signal none of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way so its not of a concern i took the cables and made a 1 trunk of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories the tv sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt i rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong it also looks nice and stays well hidden its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the tv easy \( i had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables \) i am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product	positive

this receiver puts out a lot of power it also has a bit of weight to it it comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound the remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a dvd player cd player radio and many other devices the display is nice you really have to read the manual before you start plugging away if you re a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up	positive

i wish i had read the amazon reviews of this item before i paid 19 for it at an office supply store it may seem a bit trivial but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker it s unfortunate too because everything else about it is perfect the color the comfortable gel support and soft fabric and the size \( it runs the length of my mac keyboard and provides support when i use my mouse \) but the smell a piercing toxic smell that does not go away it doesn t matter if i spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer i still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad and it s made it impossible for me to work i finally had to get rid of it	negative

i am glad i purchased my cardscan 700 but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all my impression is that this is the best product on the market due to its scanning properties which are quite good there are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place pros it does a pretty good job of scanning the algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive even cards that catch and rotate as they go through producing a funny smeared image have some of their contents scanned correctly the superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product there is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards operationally the product is especially nice i can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one glancing at the screen to catch errors the card image is retained in the record in the cardscan database which is important cons 1 \) the exit path has places that cards can hang up and they can catch as they go through this happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat so part of the operation is to try to prevent that by straightening out bent corners ahead of time and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck quite needless if the exit path was smooth and continuous this wouldn t happen the problem is in the rear of the plastic case 2 \) although the product retains the image of the business card there s no way to pass that through to outlook or export it to any other format this is very unfortunate i could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one except that cardscan software does not permit copy paste functions on the image why not it s easy to implement 3 \) every time i start the program it harasses me about registering even though i ve been specific that i do not wish to it also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though i ve asked it not to do that it therefore ignores the user wishes 4 \) the data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file in a simple text or csv format there is no way to create an outlook format pst file which would simplify importing and allow for the future option of including an image outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record but apparently cardscan folks aren t even close to thinking about this 5 \) if i indicate that a data export for a file is destined for outlook the field names are not set up correctly so unless i do some heavy editing of field names nothing much other than the contact name gets across if i export directly to the running outlook program it isn t perfect but it s close enough to be usable why did cardscan get one right and not the other in neither case can i send the card image over 6 \) i was forced to install microsoft net software even though i intended to do all my exports via files i didn t get a choice if i didn t install net the installer stopped and exited without installing any cardscan software	negative

i m not the most gadget inclined person and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use but i have to say i ve had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out it s either off or on but there s not much gradation between the two in fact i get almost no gain at all until i reach almost the 3 00 position on the dial and then it s a lot and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation it basically keeps me locked into soft close singing and a girl can t do that all the time other than that i haven t had any problems but that one almost renders it useless i don t know if there s something more reliable \( and sane \) out there but if there is go for that instead even if it costs more why spend money on something that doesn t work	negative
length of ownership 8 weeks this puppy really reaches out my laptop s internal intel pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks thanks to some friendly neighbors i ve said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections and until metrofi completes its set up of free city wide wifi i ll get by with that thanks to this neat hawking device unless i need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices i hope the hawking dish proves durable after all it s been just 2 months of ownership so far albeit good ones note for me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off beam signals fairly well also placement by a window will help your reception	positive

when we initially pulled this out the box i was excited becaue it was crafted so well real wood and excellent craftsmanship however the sound absolutely sucks it sounds like elmo s toy piano or even worse i thought it was just the fact that the piano was sitting flat on the floor \( i hadn t installed the legs yet \) and the sound was just off by the time i got everything assembled the disappointment settled in even deeper this piano was not worth the price i paid for it by any stretch of the imagination i realize this is a toy and not an instrument but again for the money you d expect a better sounding product an added note my daughter loves banging on it	positive

sandisk leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one it works excellent on my phone samsung t609 i would have bought a 1gb but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it so bear that in mind for pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent for music as an mp3 lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video data and in general is terrific just like i said sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card i will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions only sandisk is extremely reliable personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly	positive

i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory although 15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds the 100 shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it s category	positive
i looked at all the different cases for my new ipod with video and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case so i bought it it exceeds my expectations it s fantastic my ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof this helps when down the road i might want to sell it the screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable i like the fact that it s held off of the ipod s screen so it won t scratch the clickwheel is easily usable actually more so because of the circle around it i bought the case on amazon from sonicswap and am astounded at how fast i got it 2 days amazing this case is for the 60gb ipod with video it clearly says that in the title not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that don t hesitate this is the case	positive

firstoff that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong let me explain how this works the soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like itunes it has its own proprietary format that is really just mp3 with a different file extension title when you import your mp3s into the soundstage library it makes its own duplicate library of your music in a new directory using its omg file suffix yes omg i think that s funny and you should too the minidiscs themselves are essentially just cd rws keep this in mind they are enjoyable cheap to buy more they are rewritable and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd audio or close to 4 5 hours of low bitrate audio which is just compressed mp3s the product itself is very good i ve had one for a short while i bought an eight pack of disks right after i got it and filled them with music i have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc swapping of five hour playlists is far less irritating than my old cd player method cd swapping with 70 minute albums the controls are very simple and effective grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio cd its impeccably shockproof and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight the hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light i got this as an alternative to harddrive mp3 jukeboxes most mp3 players over a gig in capacity are hd storage which is far less durable \( in my experience \) than simpler players rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that i would have to swap on my computer constantly i got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me its a solution that suited me well	positive
for its price and definately for its length its an awesome alternative to it s 100 monster counterpart	positive
they listed the 49x and they shipped the 49a \( standard capacity \) so like everyone else who bought this product it is really the standard capacity toner that you are going to get you may get it at a lower cost elsewhere check around	negative

we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera s return policy they grudgingly allowed me to return it as a one time courtesy with a restocking fee i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company	negative
works just as expected switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop \( all running winxp \) each machine takes 1 min to recognize same as when plugging in any new usb device very durable cables was concerned about using wireless keyboard mouse but works great with the microsoft wireless desktop including the multimedia function keys version of the switch that i received is black not white as pictured	positive
i purchased this item recently at a local radio shack because it was on sale for 7 99 in my case i did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered but i did get a disappointing one i use an older cd writer \( nec nr 7800a \) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16x and i have achieved that speed with other media \( notably imation \) in my system however these sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8x no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive on the positive side all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my dvd rom drive dvd player and cd player there s no point in buying this sony product when there are so many others out there find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it update the current model number on sony s web site for the 50 pack cd r spindle is 50cdq80ls3 \( not 50cdq80ls2 \) if you still want to buy sony try to find the current model number	negative
this is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours \( but did make it beyond the very short warrenty \) it was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long for the price i expected a durable and well built machine i was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it	negative

the first one i ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the usb devices i was plugging into it although i had considered just getting a refund amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles the replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now the usb 2 is much faster than the original usb ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price	positive
this battery will transform your epson picturemate deluxe viewer edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute must have item i take it with me when ever i m doing an off site photo shoot or even when i m out for a weekend shooting candids the portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless i have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge	positive

all of the pc to stereo cbales i could find in the stores were only 6ft long due to the furniture arrangement in my living room i needed a longer cable to make the connection i was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances the 20 ft monster cable took care of both those issues for me the connections are solid and the sound quality is great it was well worth the money	positive
i read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn t so sure about it however after buying and trying it out i have no regrets don t know why i waited soo long to get one \( dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one \) although made of plastic it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding the clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold unlike other models this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books i have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem	positive
i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound sending these ones back i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well \( much to my mom s dismay she couldn t fuss at me p \) oh well	negative
good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device my major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and i would not use it it is just right and great protection for my 1955 by the way i replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen it is a great piece of protection	positive
i ve never had a problem with these dvds they burn and play perfectly and i ve never had a problem printing on them what s particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole it doesn t sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds by the way i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds	positive
the toshibamd14f52 arrived defective some channels would not function properly ghost images and snow on screen we have direct connect cable with 5 other tvs that work perfectly toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with they were evasive would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what i had already tried to make the tv work they also told me to call my cable company for help finally after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly toshiba people i was referred to a tv repair agent for toshiba that turned out to be unsavory dishonest given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the tv as he claimed he refused to plug it in to show it worked well as i suspected when i got home and tried the tv he had left the tv as non functional as it was when he received it but insisted it was fixed he told me to buy an external tv antenna and not use my cable tv i will never buy another toshiba tv again	negative

i used these speakers \( 4 \) as part of my 7 1 channel theater and i used the hti 55 center channel plus the hti 8 ceiling to finish off my system i have a denon 2307ci pumping these speakers and let me tell you i can t even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers rock my entire house from the basement these are the best in wall speakers i have ever bought buy them now before they re all gone highly recommend	positive
i purchased this gps back in april of 2006 and have been very happy with it since it is not perfect but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker gps it s a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises in the car it is accurate and maps routes quickly 90 of the time the other 10 of the time it either looses signal has outdated maps \( my update is ordered and on it s way as i type \) or just slow processing for some reason of this 10 of the time i d say only 2 of the time has this been an actual problem for me the rest of the time i was able to simply guess what i needed to do next or it didn t matter at all i have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations but the vast majority of the time this hasn t been an issue on foot one of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof both qualities needed to be used for hiking the only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads otherwise you will get some really confusing directions also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses but it can be done \( put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route \) on boat haven t tested this as i don t have a boat and haven t purchased the water based maps overall i m very happy with this and looking forward to the map update i wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points it s still better than buying lugging around 2 seperate gps systems to me	positive
seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal price wise it was great however it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well the directions are terrible they are extremely difficult to follow i never could get it to sync with outlook i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child s play in comparison in this case you get what you pay for don t purchase this you ll be sorry take care it s a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen ad nauseum do you carry the manual with you put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the english language truly disappointed with this worthless plastic	negative

camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as dlink recommends i bought from ebay new and dlink refused to replace or repair so beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired think twice about buying dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty from unauthorized seller or buying used	negative
this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i wouldn t take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate	negative
this bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my apple notebook be sure to insert the bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin i thought mine was in far enough at first but it really wasn t one caveat i was hoping that the bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room but it s not also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both bluetooth and cable at the same time	positive

this is a direct comparision between the linksys wusbf54g and trendnet 509ub both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector both perform as expected on windows xp installation was quirky for both after driver installation inserting into usb slot it wasn t recognized at all fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device had to disable the notebook s builtin wireless before xp recognized the device client software does not detect a device under windows vista ultimate rc2 i assume this will be true for windows vista rtm too inserting the device into a windows vista rc2 system often completely froze windows vista \( had to hold down power button for complete reboot \) had to disable the notebook s builtin wireless before vista recognized the device appears that the trendnet and linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same oem or reference design as expected evaluation results are similar 1 both devices seem to have same sensitivity similar to notebook s internal wireless card 2 trendnet device doesn t have windows xp signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried also installing on new usb ports requires extra clicks 3 trendnet device supports 801 11a whereas linksys does not 4 trendnet device sometimes crashes vista ultimate rc2 5 neither device s software client works under vista ultimate rc2 this isn t a deal breaker for me as they both work under vista ultimate rc2 networking as a usb wireless key you just lose the client software feature 6 the linksys has a somewhat useful backlit lcd trendnet does not 7 both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well 8 in hotspot mode both devices show ssid channel number encryption mode etc conclusion for xp i recommend the trendnet so save the extra dollars for vista i recommend the linksys device as it never crashed vista ultimate rc2 whereas trendnet device was gave occasional freezes	positive
i have to admit the main reason i purchased \( 2 \) of these dvc 1100 s was because of the stellar reviews posted here on amazon i bought one for my in laws and on for my wife and i so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance great idea bad solution the main problem i had was that the camera lens is fixed and does not focus i waited 1 hour on the line with d link tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 8 feet away from the camera unfortunately the ones i got did not focus at all and the video quality was absolutely terrible \( washed out color and bad contrast \) please listen to me save your money and do not buy the dvc 1100 this device is cheaply made and just not there yet	negative

i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head isn t working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they don t even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is don t buy this model	negative

this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device doesn t fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i m very disappointed and i m returning it	negative
i ve been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years i ve used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday i ride a motorcycle everyday and i never leave without these first the comfort is exceptional even with my helmet on i never get uncomfortable with these in my ears i ve ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems even when i need a break from the music i leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise i ve used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable tolerable at best but most are painful with a helmet on the bulb you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep second the sound quality is fantastic great bass mids and highs i ve heard things in my music i never knew was there and i can t wait to listen more i can t recommend these enough i ve bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine	positive
i bought this phone for the great features and because i ve had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i can t talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them	negative

i agree with the other review sony brand vhs tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years as a almost life long user of sony premium grade tapes i have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality i get when i record even off my dish the picture is never up to snuff with what i see when i watch the show as it is being recorded for the past two years i have been able to notice the differences when i am watching something on a sony tape the flaws have become to big to ignore i will be buying tdk from now on and i suggest you do the same sony used to make a great vhs tape but i guess they are concentrating now on making more playstations	negative
i recently bought one of these for our 18 month old son the piano arrived in fine shape the piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly the sound is just like i remember a toy piano should sound notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale including sharps and flats most importantly our little boy just loves playing this piano hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy including the electronic toys we have purchased for him i also liked that he wasn t able to pull off the keys try as he may they just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment	positive

this is just a general review of all dvd cases i have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs i was stationed in germany for over 2 years and anyone who had been there knows that afn sucks so dvd s is your only source of video entertainment my collection grew to more than 400 i have been trying to find a good case that hold equal number of title books as it does dvd s but that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to be made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard p o s s and nothing i would want to keep in my garage i hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied	negative

this cable really cleaned up the display image i had been running another monster cable the 6 meter version i needed the length before because of the way my system was configured i have a review under that cable about how quality does matter and so does length at the time i wrote the review i was just ordering the cable and was posting what i had found out in researching digital video signals everything in there stands true i changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable the 1 meter version because i could now get away with a much shorter cable i installed it this morning and the difference while not earth shattering was definitely visible i use this cable to connect between the video card on a media pc and my tv \( sony rear projection lcd \) the image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows text etc and the image wasn t as clear as i had hoped while the image looked good it didn t look great that s why i decided to take the plunge and spend an extra 79 bucks the difference is somethine like going from a regular rf feed to your tv and component video cables now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming it actually brings out detail i couldn t even see before to the point of deciding to turn on fsaa and filtering so video games have a more realistic look and that they do i don t know how other brands compare to the monster cables as i haven t tried them what i do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display you can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing one more thing while i m here i want to thank amazon for going the extra mile on customer service i had a dvd disappear somehow during shipping ups said they delivered it but i never received it i asked amazon if they filed the report with ups or i did to file a claim what i got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way that is service thanks amazon	positive
opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked simple as that i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only \( very minor \) problem there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone	positive
i ordered a pair of these online a bit nervous as i wasn t ever able to hear them \( i heard a pair of jbl sp6c s the cheaper version at best buy and wasn t all that impressed although it might have been the poor listening environment \) anyway the speakers arrived we installed them \( they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling \) and i m quite impressed note that we re using these for whole house background music not home theater so my standards aren t as high as they would be in the ht case but for a 6 5 speaker these put out a surprising amount of bass and clear highs right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we re shopping for a better one and they still sound great these probably would be just fine for ht rear speaker use \( i wouldn t want any in ceiling speaker for front or center ht use \) our home theater downstairs already has jbl speakers \( studio series for the fronts and center northridge for the rears \) and i ve been very happy with them i recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in ceiling speaker without breaking the bank	positive

this product is a sad joke it s expensive of course the paper is just heavyweight paper that s perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves which takes some effort \( not sure if it d be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board \) but whatever however the software is crap that s the appropriate term reading this i can save you an hour of your precious time no you can t make the template show right side up that s right to use the software you have to tilt your head sideways i m not kidding i guess you could also turn your monitor on it s side you can rotate the text so it shows the way it should but when you edit it it ll be sideways again so you ll have to turn your head \( or monitor \) back and forth sideways what kind of company would sell such a product and oh yeah if you re looking for templates for the dvd inserts nada they re not there	negative
i didn t want to fork over 500 for a bose or boston acoustics or even 350 for a cambridge soundworks and then i found this little gem for about 175 shipping i ve had it for a few days and so far i am impressed the sx functions are very intuitive easy to set the time and both alarms i thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the cd player compartment no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm the alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated which is great the buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them and the cd am fm tuner and aux buttons will glow when they are active the volume control and tuner knobs are recessed but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges i suppose the snooze sleep button is a good size the sleep function can be toggled for 90 60 or 30 minutes the range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the sx the speakers measure about 2 5 inches and with the volume turned up you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit i like that it has adjustable bass and treble which can vary from 5 to 5 i have the bass set to 3 and treble to 2 and it sounds great it doesn t have the range of say a home entertainment system but definitely rivals my sony bookshelf system the mp3 player on the sx could be better but is adequate during playback the lcd will scroll to display the filename title artist and track it can be programmed for up to 64 tracks but i haven t had the time or patience for this instead i just numbered the mp3 tracks in the order i wanted before burning them to the cd rom the repeat function works well and you can choose either to repeat one track repeat all tracks or repeat just one folder however the shuffle function is rather limited as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an mp3 from any of the folders \( resulting in less than desired combinations of music \) and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once one of the things i looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini jack and it also has a jack for headphones i have my laptop on my nightstand right now and it playing mp3s on winamp sound great plugged into the sx there are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit lcd the default level cannot be changed or dimmed and is rather bright in a dark room it will make everything glow takes a little while to get used to but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight i guess it is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small and the brightness of the lcd can kind of drown out the analog display but then again i wear glasses so i suppose i have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes when the radio or cd player is in operation the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower default level with the dimmer button on the remote control one other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup and you will notice this is the case with many japanese units including the sony clock radios i guess the power grid in japan is really stable so they don t have use for this but still it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery on the other hand i was informed by teac tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for up to 3 hours i haven t had the time to test the maximum threshold but i can say that i did unplug the clock for about a minute and when i plugged it back in sure enough the time and alarms were still correct overall i am really impressed by this unit the only thing that could be better is if the mp3 player shuffle had a few more options but i guess this is ok as many i have seen mp3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all also i wish the lcd backlight could be adjusted a little more it is a bit pricey at just under 200 but i have heard many clock radios and you would have to spend 350 to get anywhere near the sound quality of the teac sx	positive
as of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed the ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it youu can even find this as low as 140 or chaper im not sure why the bad reviews this is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want older versions did not allow this you should buy this the video quality isnt great but good thats why i gave it four stars instead of five it is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu you must use the ipod itself but being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks \( audio video \) is great i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd all in all its completely worth it even as a stand alone dvd player it s great never had the first proble	positive

i didn t purchase this one it was a gift i was hoping for a laser printer like one of the brother all in ones i opted to install the lite version of the software from hp com i would suggest that everyone do this the lite version only has the drivers none of the hp bull software that is included usually the thing that bothered me the most was the automatic document feeder i would start a scan job and everything is going fine and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang i had over 500 pages of documents to scan and this machine really let me down amazing how hewlett packard can t even write reliable drivers i gave the item 2 stars because i got it to print sometimes no buy	negative

specs look good hdmi 1 3a 1080p firmware upgrade over ethernet etc the unit seems to be solid \( heavy \) and well built however toshiba chose to ship this hd dvd player with only a composite a v cable \( yellow red white rca jacks \) in the box the best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i and not even as good as an s video connection for that it is pretty amazing that a high end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high definition capabilities and hdmi 1 3a interface is being shipped without a cable set \( component video or hdmi \) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an hdtv i don t know how much cost savings toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than 5 now let s get to the real review pros one of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular dvds to 1080p the upscaling is very high quality the unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered dvds if the weight of the unit is any indication build quality is high it has an ethernet port for firmware updates \( and possible future functionality \) cons very slow boot time takes longer to boot than my windows xp pc especially durimg 1080p hd dvd playback the unit gets very hot make sure your enclosure rack is open in the back there is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player this player has no zoom scaling functions for dealing with non anomorphic dvds so you have to use your tvs scaling function kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers	negative

i ve owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality lots of hardy walkmen useful shortwave and portable radios stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders i still have a sony mini component stereo model fh e656 \( made in japan \) which i bought in 1992 for us 400 but rather than pay to fix its worn out cd player i decided to purchase this new sony mhcec70 component stereo \( made in china \) pluses decent sound good functionality easy set up and intuitive operation simple remote but only covers basic functions cons very short speaker leads unattractive styling \( for my tastes \) resembles a boombox only holds 3 cds vs 5 for comparable panasonic units at first glance i was disappointed by the cheap construction skimpy manual and very short speaker leads the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies but then i thought in 2006 for 150 i can t expect the same quality as i received in 1992 for 400 everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in china so for the money it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom the real test will be how long the cd changer works to be safe this time i bought the 2 year replacement warranty i haven t blasted it at full volume but it seems to have plenty of power when needed i originally bought a 300 panasonic unit \( sc pm71sd mp3 sd micro system \) which was returned because it didn t have the full data recording feature as advertised \( data recording was crippled by drm limitations \) this sony stereo costs half as much and has almost all the same functionality	positive
i purchased this because i have to do a lot of math online and was hoping i could use this for that purpose also i was hoping to be able to use it for taking notes so far i m not impressed the pen is a crummy little plastic thing and not very satisfying to use it is actually very uncomfortable particularly when you consider you have to press very hard to get your entire note set to be recorded talk about writer s cramp i m also disappointed that you can t write on it and have it instantly displayed to the computer interactively my fault for not understanding the functionality better but i thought this could double as a writing tablet i can t speak to the size of the paper since i haven t tried any other size in general a big disappointment and 90 dollars that i would have been better off just setting on fire another item destined for craigslist p s to the reviewer who was wanting handwriting recognition my pad did come with a trial version of a package that would convert to text of course that was of very limited use since the stooopid thing failed to capture my handwriting accurately in the first place but the capability is there	negative

first off i like this unit it s easy to use and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck \( it doesn t work with regular data cds \) hit the phono aux button followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp take it out of pause it starts recording instantly between each song hit a button and it break the recording into tracks pretty cool it s got great potential but there are still a few shortcomings for example i was surprised to see that it doesn t let you record off of the radio just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn t digital it s a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago i wouldn t mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too oddly the remote does have an am fm button they should just label it the radio button because when you think of it switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re tune the station too using the dial another key point is that the unit doesn t have any outputs at all so you can t pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers i would rate this as 3 5 stars but since we can t use half stars i ll give it 4 for one big reason for all it s shortcomings it works and there are very few alternatives speaking of alternatives here are a few other options 1 a standalone cd recorder i have one of these too the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck in my case my stand alone unit has two drives so not only can i record from any source in my system but i can dub from one drive to the other also my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds \( it s easier than using a pc however the song titles are just numbers \) in my case i opted not to use this for my lp projects because i no longer have a turntable i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable i might as well pay a bit more for this unit 2 crosley makes a simuilar unit but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot 3 a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it you plug your turntable or other external source into it plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality \( wav vs several mp3 sampling rates \) viola it records directly to your flash drive ipod or external hard drive if you do go that route make sure you get the plus model the older model is outdated and doesn t work as well 4 use a pc even though it will give you the best possible sound and options it s out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc or bog it down while i m trying to use it for that matter keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards then filtering the files with your favorite audio software then re burn the files to cd or mp3	positive

i got this case for my ws 320m which i ve been wearing around my neck like a mp3 player the material of the case seems to be genuine leather \( or really good vinyl \) and brushed felt it looks good professional looking i ve enclosed what i hope are representative pictures of this case all the buttons of the recorder are accessible even when the flap is closed the microphone headphone jacks are available as are the rec stop play buttons if the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built in microphone you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well there is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the hold button on the side of the recorder not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the hold button however since the hold button is meant to slide down \( away from the microphone \) for it to be released if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case the resulting friction would actually unlock the hold button the belt loop is an adjustable velcro i would have preferred a sewn on belt loop \( so the case cannot come off the belt accidently \) or a nice stiff clip \( for easy access \) or even a riveted snap button but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times the case is closed shut with another velcro strap all in all it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport or being able to put it on your belt after everything else \( line in mic headphone recording playing \) is set up the relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case \( mainly due to very small buttons \) as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case the case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder my bias lies in that i like to use it as an mp3 player and i wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap loop from a flash drive placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such i think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt on one positive note i believe this is the first time that i was the first reviewer for anything from amazon woo hoo	negative

i have two seperate units one hardwired to my car and the other is the jvc unit i hooked it directly into the audio \( aux \) ports of my radio rather than use an fm station it works great the sound quality is excellent as well \( and my radio is so old it play s 8 tracks \) i did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot i agree with the previous reviews that it is something that jvc needs to look into perhaps it is simply a matter of a heat sink er not being in specs as yet i have encountered no problems \( having had the jvc unit for 1 5 years \) no matter as to the commercial free sirius \( which i have had a subscription to for the past 4 years \) has commercial free radio though the news stations and a few others do have commercials those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block the music stations are 100 free of commercial all in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating dj s commerical s and lack of variety in stations cheers	positive

the first ipod clock radio i bought was an emerson itone that was very disappointing after returning it i did a bunch of research and decided to order the i177 \( white \) i am very happy with the unit the sound is great while it is not a bose it sounds way better than your average alarm clock the controls are very intuitive and simple to use i have a 4th generation ipod and it fit perfectly another great feature is the display dimmer you can turn the backlight completely off a feature not found in many other products a common complaint i read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room not a problem with this unit the remote control is pretty neat too i like the fact that i can control my ipod remotely there are 2 separate alarms which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time the only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations this would be nice but i bought this unit to wake to my ipod so i can t complain overall this thing is great	positive

i have been putting this television through its paces since i got it a few weeks ago and it is by far the best tv i have ever owned and very difficult to beat the image quality is really good with bright vivid colors and wonderful detail especially for 1080i p content but even lower resolution 720p content which is what s more commonly available on ota hd broadcast looks phenomenal i also have an apple tv hooked up to it and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p 480p or 720p it still looks quite good it does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost and the dnie processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse however it s very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have like all lcds it does have some slight black point problems these aren t noticeable for fullscreen 16 9 content but for older 4 3 content it s pretty obvious that the black isn t pure black however this is again tunable the only thing i really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn t do a very good job of upscaling 480i content such as the output from most video game systems and for dvds to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up it s really more a sad reflection on how the previous next generation video looks downright primitive by today s standards the other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners it doesn t have an on screen program guide my previous tv \( also a samsung \) had an on screen program guide but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the epg information anyway so it s not really that big of a deal you can still see the detailed information for the program that s currently showing so it makes use of epg just not as much as it could this television s tuner is also quite phenomenal my previous tv required a very carefully positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation while with this one i only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and i get perfect reception of every local digital station another nice improvement over samsung s older hdtvs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that tv stations do \( for example pillboxing a letterboxed 16 9 show which is very common for widescreen non hd programming \) also analog tv stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo \( while previous samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material \) as a pc monitor this is also quite nice i have a mac mini hooked up via svga cable and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal clear and of course you can hook it up via hdmi \( with a dvi to hdmi adaptor \) as well the only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint at least on analog svga the only 16 9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080 which can be difficult for some older systems to handle however on hdmi it should support all the standard hd resolutions this television may be more expensive than others in its size class but it also far outshines every other tv i have seen aside from the newer ln t4065 which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio if you want to only buy one tv which will last for a long time it would be hard to go wrong with this one	positive
i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it but that s really a personal problem	positive
i originally bought this cd case for my car because i listen to cds the most while driving this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all it is very large and heavy \( even without cds \) and the long zipper tail makes it hard to open with one hand i now use it to house computer software and playstation gamecube games for what you pay it is an excellent buy	positive
sony advertised this as a 18x burner for dvd r media i used the recommended brand \( verbatim \) and taiko yuden which are very high end media i was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder the movies are in mpeg format i was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter unfortunately i got only 12x write speed with the provided software in a mac as well as in a pc \( just slower than advertised no clusters \) it is a noisy drive too i spoke with sony costumer service and i could not get any satisfactory answers i had to wait a long time to be helped they said that the drive was probably damaged i returned it and i do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive	negative

hello i purchased the avic d2 xm and the ipod kit from amazon i then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup after 3 5 hours they failed i decided that i d return the items because i needed to get an alternative gift before christmas and i didn t have time to find another way to get it installed i was able to return the d2 but the gex p10xmt and the ib100ii are not returnable it turns out that amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies had i realized that amazon would sell me something that i can t return i would have purchased elsewhere at this point i will never purchase anything else from amazon ever again	negative

i bought one for a relative last christmas saw how convenient and easy it was to program so i bought one for myself this march it works just great the setup software programs the 670 easily and the logitech remote replaces the remotes for a hdtv a dvd home theater a v receiver a dishhd dvr receiver and a psyclone psc01 source selector one button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity i like the color screens and icons on the higher end logitech remotes but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use function wins forms this time round all is not rosy though added the sony ps3 to the entertainment arena the bluetooth requirements of the ps3 leaves it out of the ir rf remotes inner circle consider this if you need a combined solution for infra red rf as well as bluetooth devices \( the sony ps3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case \) fully backlit is a signifcant bonus none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features short version this cool tool really works and should satisfy most think out of the box though if you have a sony ps3 tied into your entertainment network click	positive

these are 10 headphones there s nothing amazing about them in my opinion i bought them to use with my ipod when i m out or at work right out of the box i was disappointed with the fit and i know everyone is going to be different but for me they just aren t comfortable the sound quality is clear but very thin and lacking bass even when i m pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit the bass just isn t good eq settings to boost the bass don t help either and often reduce sound quality even more the ear clips don t really seem to do that much either they kind of keep them on your ears but don t really hold them in your ears at all the ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well in summary i wouldn t recommend these for music but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word they might be good if you can tolerate them in your ears for that long	negative
i was pretty disappointed with the tune belt because of two main reasons first i had to take my shuffle out of the protective rubber case that i usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the tune belt that wasn t such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve but then i went to wear it for a run and the arm band was too small for my arm i have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training but nothing outrageous i would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users this is unfortunately not the case so if you have larger than average biceps \( say 17 amd up \) save your money	negative

this review is more about the hi md concept in general than one particular player the sound quality was excellent the rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace complaints the only thing that isn t proprietary is the headphone jack and the aa battery beyond that sony s dual role as a content provider \( complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers \) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players no macintosh support is just the beginning proprietary compression algorithms weird and twisted upload download rules wrong choices made at every point of the prd process 100x recording speed make that 4x on a good day 100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of elliot spitzer if he only cared the players are flimsy just walking with mine caused it to skip and one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely sony will charge you to honor the warranty \( parts only no labor \) by contrast apple replaced my daughter s ipod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups trying to find hi mds offers the thrill of the hunt if you re into that kind of thing but their rarity suggests that sony is at best half hearted about supporting this device i used to be a loyal sony customer but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing in fact i m planning an hd tv purchase next year and have sony far down on the list of possibilities you can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days howard are you listening	negative

i have really bad luck with head sets \( i dropped a vise on my last set really \) these are really well built headphones it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set they can get very loud and not crack exceptional base and mic is very very clear they are light but feel solid although i have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong i have very big ears that is one of the reasons i bought this head set it is very comfortable the only thing i don t like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups but maybe it help keep your ears cool maybe i really give them 4 1 2 stars i paid about 90 for them and i have no regrets so if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the sony mdr 300 mdr 400 they don t have mics but good headphones hope this helped good luck	positive

when i got this product out of the box \( i hadn t seen one in a store before \) i was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared particularly at the price they charged \( about 80 at the time \) the box i received was also missing the insert for the ipod nano and the nano won t sit securely in the ipod socket without it i returned this product and for about the same price i got a much more solid and better sounding boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano \( though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your ipod songs \) this wouldn t be a bad ipod speaker set if you could get it for 20 but at 80 it s dramatically overpriced	negative

beware of kingston rebates of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product \( s \) but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a 50 mail in rebate i promptly \( as in the day after i received the item delivery \) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer \( think huge online e tailer \) the rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of 1 business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer well now what i can t re send the original \( it was already in their possession \) i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i re sent my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another 6 weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply wouldn t honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i couldn t really submit to their requirements if you re looking for a ram upgrade i d suggest you look at a quality company like ocz \( the best \) or patriot geil or corsair if you re looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are value driven products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better value to performance ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams	negative
it s a good phone works well i like the caller id function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone makes them easier to see use it has good sound a ring tone that doesn t jangle the nerves the only problem i had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone one must use the cord that the phone comes with rather than one already in use i purchased an adapter so that i could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack not a big deal in my book but one i didn t learn about until i got the phone overall i am pleased with it	positive

below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks pros 1 amazing sound especially when watching dvd movies 2 very good progessive scan dvd picture quality 3 simple compact and all in one design 4 remote control can work with various tv s cable boxes and vcr s 5 can play both ntsc and pal dvd s cons 1 expensive 2 no hdmi output 3 non intuative remote control 4 no headphone jack overall i love and chose the bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design i got this system because i wanted a compact all in one media center and i was not interested in getting a htib with 5 speakers i looked at denon \( 2 products \) sony and samsung i use this on my 23 samsung lcd tv using monster component video cables and while i would have preferred to take advatange of its hdmi capabilties the reality is that i am very happy with this image quality movies such as lord of the rings the matrix and hero look and sound fantastic prior to this i was looking at the sony dav x1 which is much cheaper and more feature rich however the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me for example my pal dvds cannot be played on the sony whereas on the bose it was no problem i am of the opinion that sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products to be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their truespace 2 1 surround sound feature my couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me according to bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the tv sometimes truespace works and sometimes i can t hear it i believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other if surround sound is really that important to you then you should get a 5 1 system this product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3d sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec room the audio quality from music cd s is very good and while i wish this had an ipod port as found on the denon i am very content using the aux port	positive

i really tried to like the via michelin bought it with every intention of loving it in march 2007 but i feel compelled to tell most of you to keep shopping i bought it due to the excellent price small thin size \( compared to garmin \) i thought how bad can it be i ordered it and had it shipped to my door then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it this is because my other gps units were in other cars with other family members already on other trips i bought this one as a budget gps optimistic that it was new and had the sirf iii chip but before long i hated this unit all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me and i will tell you about it below first please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with other gps units or they didn t spend much time with it before they reviewed it or they haven t had experience with gps in 4 years which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing for positive reviewers if this is their first newer gps and if they are comparing it to a car navigational gps of 4 years ago then yes it is quite a bit better but compared to the new units like mio 310x or the tom tom one \( both of which i own \) then the viamichelin has a horrible user interface and is horrible to use on the roads tomtom and mio often finish what you are typing for you they are intuitive and programmers have polished them but the viamichelin is very non intuitive absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly sure we are not supposed to use them while we drive and with this one it is truly dangerous even when you learn the complicated system so most of the time you have to pull over and work on it but it is no fun and even you program it if you go to another screen it loses it and you have to program the history all over you will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything and how lost it often gets i will try to give you the pros pros small form factor decent screen sirf 3 chip navteq maps four hour battery life good price for a sirf 3 chip unit cons horrible non intuitive software program clunky multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency or even if you are not in a hurry horrible speaker volume so poor and speaker so poor you can t hear it with any road noise present seriously turn speaker up all the way while driving it will crackle and is illegible i read this in a review but honestly didn t believe it until i owned it third unlike any gps i ve had this one literally tells you to start driving before it can tell you which way to go when you ve routed it to the nearest store etc think about that it means sometimes you have a 50 chance of making the right choice as to which way to go then if you guess wrong it tells you to turn around and go the other way seriously that one feature should be enough to make you say no as most gps will at least tell you to turn right from where you are parked or turn left but this one will say start driving without any direction because it can t seem to route until you drive onto a road it can t do it from a parking lot it already will have the satellite location that s not it it s a software bugaboo i think built into the programming it makes you start driving because it can t find your location or know which way you are going until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling bad software design for sure when you go to canada you have to have installed \( on another sd card \) the canadian map very inconvenient when you cross the border navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal maine literally we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn \( much slower than my mio 310 which was purchasd last year or tom tom one which was purchased this year \) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic caused us to miss several critical exits want to find poi s on the run forget it too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands it often could not find even local walmarts one s that have been there for 20 years i m serious i parked in front of walmarts that it could not find very old walmarts to be sure garmin tomtom and mio do not list all walmarts but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town not so via in several towns in maine and connecticut i parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years punch in local stores on the difficult to use poi list and it can t find any of them also punch in or look for stores like nearest walmart mio and tom tom had no problems finding several or the nearest ones it knew about from your location but with via it has to be within a certain distance from you or it will not show up as existing so you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location to try to find the store very very clunky can t tell you how much trouble that is it s so simple on the other units you get spoiled with the garmin or tomtoms this one makes it so hard and still can t find the poi s no gps finds all stores there is a limit on poi s of course but it seems the via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for bank atm s and not restaurants shopping etc believe me once you ve used it on a trip it s organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a gps themselves before i can t say enough about how difficult the interface is and when you go back or forward to another screen it often loses where it is and you have to start all over again programming where you are going going through multiple difficult steps when you lose power again you start all over when i bought it i read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought how bad can it be i thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason wrong the experienced gps users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces example on one trip my daughter began to throw up and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one when you are panicked you want to quickly find the nearest hospital this unit makes you put in the town etc if you are further than x miles or so like when you are on the interstate so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital which is horrible i had this happen before and with the mio about 3 clicks and bam you have searched and found the nearest hospital one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital truly i am sad to not recommend the viamichelin i really recommend you pass like some other reviewers have suggested and i recommend you to buy the more rapid easy to use mio with the great screen blazing fast sirf 3 and calculating chip and loud clear speaker if you are tech challenged buy the garmin or tomtom s with their awesome and easy to use software interface but don t buy this bad speakered horrible interfaced poorly designed buggy unit on paper it looks like a killer unit but in reality it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use finally there is the fun factor the tomtom one is fun the mio is fast and fun a pleasure to use even the newer garmin s are fun with their simplicity \( i hated the screen on some of the old garmins \) but the viamichelin x 930 has no fun programmed in it is not a pleasure to use although it will take you across country believe me the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker unpolished unfun clunky interface with poorly organized features and disorganized poi s and menus the polished quick intuitive menu is where garmin and tomtom shine the only thing better on the viamichellin is the screen and sirf chip some of the older garmin s use an older satellite gps chip than the viamichellin but new tomtom s and via use the same gps satellite chip but faster software routines and cpu chips but even the use of the sirf 3 chip on the via michelin cannot make up for the poor software and menu design theoretically this thing should be blazing fast but it is much slower than my tomtom or mio the only thing better on this unit than the mio is that the via is smaller and thinner and maybe the navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals but other than that the mio wins hands down by far a faster better and easier to use gps in my opinion if you are looking for software ease go garmin first then tom tom then mio and via last if you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the mio 310x it s a killer unit and it s hackable but if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going go with garmin first then tom tom i tried you mr viamichelin but you need to go to finishing school like the other gps students you are just too unfinished and rough	negative
i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and mp3 playback i agree that it could have been better it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last you cannot rewind fast forward in the song in mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again but i will have to play the entire song again i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i cannot do anymore	negative

while these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape he still insisted he couldn t remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he being the model of honesty and truth must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke very effective these old fashioned recorders	positive

i must admit the first review posted here on the d320 made me a little nervous my experience is quite different and after several months of ownership i am quite pleased i ll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review as that s the only point of reference \( so far \) 1 \) yes pick up a usb cable 2 \) printer driver installation on win98 essentially required no user intervention with winxp however i do seem to recall having to muck with it more but i m hazy on the details now 3 \) i have printed scores of multi page documents many over 15 pages without any problems whatsoever i ve had no spills or jams of any kind 4 \) i have not seen any paper curl problems whatsoever 5 \) i leave the paper cassette lid manual feed slot in place at all times as i have no problem with it for doing many two sided copies it is indeed easier to place the copies back into the paper cassette but that s my experience with any copier i ve used 6 \) making two sided copies is easy and as efficient as i expected i ve simply experienced no problems 7 \) i ve experienced no copier caused misalignments if my copies have been crooked it was because i set them on the glass improperly i am very happy with this unit it copies as i expect it to and prints just the same quickly and without event it s been able to properly print from all windoze applications i ve thrown at it and ones many users may not even be using such as ghostscript acrobat securecrt paf and all image viewing software i ve tried and i ve got several machines networked together \( win98 and winxp \) that can all print to the d320 fine using printer sharing btw the d320 comes with a full 3500 page toner cartridge too not a starter unit as with some printers copiers	positive

the card is blistering fast i just wish it didn t take a performance hit in vista it also has several other odd issues that i ve become accustomed to when buying bleeding edge technology \( e g the official drivers released in february 2007 are missing several features in windows vista like good tv out support hibernation support proper ntune support the march 2007 released vista beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games check nvidia s message board for more info \) once nvidia straightens out their vista drivers issues this card will be golden as it is the latest beta drivers did improve performance but it introduced some stability issues also evga s 90 day step up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late april 2007 lastly it puts off an odd digital whine in 3d games and when resizing windows i returned one \( with green circuitboard \) and got a new one form amazon \( black circuitboard \) and it did the same thing amazon reimbursed me the return shipping the digital whine isn t too bad but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low i play with headphones so i don t really care	positive

i have had this kensington fm transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages very frustrating during the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal i haven t measured it but it seems like as little a 10 15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior this makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles if you listen to quiet music avoid at all costs if you don t it is the best transmitter i have tried sirandar	negative
as you may have read elsewhere this router has a problem with the gre protocol used by microsoft for their pptp server \( see alan bryant s may 27 2004 review \) this will stop you using it with the built in pptp vpn client server which is provided with windows 2000 xp here is the text of a complaint i have submitted to linksys i am attempting to operate a microsoft pptp server behind a befvp41 \( firmware 1 41 1 \) i have pptp pass through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed ip address of the server but the router refuses to pass the gre protocol used by microsoft \( protocol 47 \) in answer id 737 you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with gre it does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem gre does not use tcp udp port 47 it is protocol 47 something entirely different it seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem i and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the befvp41 \( 1 41 1 \) is incapable of handling the gre protocol correctly can you please advise when a fix will be implemented this is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product i also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in ip protocols than myself i await a reply from linksys as i write this review having said all that if you have no interest in running the microsoft pptp server the befvp41 may do everything else you require it functions okay as a basic nat router and it s stealth capabilities are good \( steve gibson s shields up reports true stealth as long as you forward port 113 to a non existant host \) the in built ipsec tunneling works well i am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of befsx41 s very reliably the web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually to summarise a reasonable basic nat router very good stealth ipsec tunneling works okay \( at least to other linksys products \) microsoft s pptp server will not work with the current firmware version	negative

fm transmitters of this size don t last forever that is a fact i accept but i had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks i bought my first one from target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player the sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to oregon it was extremely noisy i plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver \( direct line of sight \) no more than 40 feet away two more days and it crackled its last and died i exchanged the transmitter at target for a new one and a week and a half later i was returning that one as well spend a few extra bucks save yourself the hassle and get a belkin	negative

this thing is junk don t waste your money i am a computer professional and i had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did work again if you buy one go through the setup and if it doesn t work immediately send it right back to amazon don t waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time finally amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged however you should pay more attention to the bad reviews than the good ones if the product is in fact good it won t have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional however look up all the bad reviews for this product they should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product	negative

bought these to use while doing my daily walks mowing they work 100 better than the little lipstick antenna you get with the myfi plus you don t have to use the earphones the only time i lose signal is if i m really boxed in an area that doesn t face south it actually works in some areas inside my house the sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me besides there ain t much in the way of other options this is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year so i use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when i want to use the fm tuner on the radio	positive

i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others so i can say just get yourself a better wireless router based on the reviews here several online fora and my own personal experience i can confirm to you that you have about a 30 chance of actually getting this to work and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another but why bother at this point there are higher power routers high gain directional antennae and there are even products sporting 802 11n which inherently has a better range that a b or g if you ve gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs research and get yourself a top notch router with good broadcast power i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth definitely hours \( if by some miracle everything works on the 12th or 13th try \) and probably a couple of days \( assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one \)	negative

if you re considering the viamichelin \( under 200 gps \) you re probably trying to decide if a gps that is more than 100 cheaper \( much more than 100 in some cases \) than its competitors is really any good honestly i would have been skeptical too however a relative bought one of these units and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before i decided to purchase one myself my brief summary is that yes this unit is a good gps and a great value after using mine on a trip i d have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine background my gps experience is limited to a 7 year old garmin iii plus i had to plan detailed trips on my pc using mapsource then upload the waypoints and routes to the gps it could be a time consuming process and because the unit wasn t necessarily user friendly my wife never learned how to use it enter the viamichelin we just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit set up time for the trip was about a minute all i had to do was program in the street address of our destination now for the rundown first what it doesn t do well a \) using it for the past two weeks \( as a test only \) around my home town i was a little disappointed it never sent me the wrong way but it didn t always take the best route some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area and in some cases old logging roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route although this was disconcerting at first i don t think it is a big deal as you ll see later b \) macro directions i e for a several hundred mile trip it will get you there and if you re taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns this would be a good device if you aren t familiar with the route but my route this weekend was very simple get to the interstate and drive it didn t pick my preferred route to the interstate and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate \( although it did recover and finally suggest my route as i stubbornly drove my way \) so for a major trip i d recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route use this device if you have a lot of mind numbing turn by turn now what it does well a \) voice prompts are great it doesn t matter that it doesn t say the street names turn right in 300 feet is good enough especially with the map that you can glance at b \) it did great around my destination towns of charlotte nc gastonia nc and rock hill sc did it take the best route as i drove from soccer fields to hotels to restaurants i don t know since i wasn t familiar with the areas but the routes seems to be just fine they got me exactly where i needed to go and i never had to look at a road map and after all this was the main reason i needed a newer gps it passed this with flying colors c \) my wife did some of the set up while in the car she ll be using this one on her on very soon d \) we wanted to find a particular restaurant but didn t have the street address the restaurant was in the points of interest database and it took us right to it also finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great i also found a feature that was not listed in the 89 page manual from the navigation map if you touch the screen it has a bypass route option it will give you some distant options \( 1 mi 5 mi etc \) then it will find a bypass route for you so if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam this will route you off the interstate take you up the road and bring you back on obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving but then it s going to try to turn you around and or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer the bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out in the future i would like to do a side by side comparison w a more expensive \( borrowed \) gps also after more experience i d like to update this review bottom line i am glad i bought this unit i cannot imagine spending 100 500 more on a more expensive model though the higher priced models may have better features the value for the extra money just isn t there for me	positive

after owning a p touch labeler for years i found the need for a more duable label than my m tape was providing i opted for this tz tape labeler good price looks good what a mistake the only thing well designed about this unit is it s abilty to waste more tape than it uses if you print a label of any size count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it at 20 00 a roll prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button then go find the scissors and cut the excess off so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk but cheer up you can push six buttons every time to reduce the margin to narrow this will reduce the waste to a half inch on one side of the label and print two small dots on the other side this will show you where to cut it with your scissors to match the narrow side also you must do all settings for every label every time another great feature it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size so you will only print large print what a joke what a hassle now the good news i used to make lots of labels and now i only make labels for very important items and only when i am up to getting mad for doing so i really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars you have been warned	negative

look for a bargain basement product what do you expect first you expect it to work and i can confirm it definitely does work when plugged in to usb it signals xp correctly the driver software is very tolerant you can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device so installation is a 5 minute process next comes the capture and initial encoding well the software is a bit lame as far as features and gui typical but it absolutely saves in mpeg2 dvd format just as you d need it to for making dvds of all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content the frame rate is full on 30 fps it takes an svideo or standard rca video signal both are just fine in quality the resolutions are not that great but its passable for dvd when you crank it up don t think you can encode some blu ray quality mpeg with this though as far as the overall durability of the product i ve literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight it gets hot but its never so much as flickered or needed reset bottom line this thing is like a kids toy its cheesy but tough as nails get it for your first analog signal mpeg encoder its a good value	positive

i have just started with an apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all they didn t sound real good and didn t come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears what s the deal with that next came the old sony mdr 027 head phones from the closet the sony s have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now they worked o k i guess but in comparison these jbuds sound much better than either of the previous ones i m now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine i m hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models crisper highs great mid range and responsive lows set up was fast too just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running the jbuds actually stay in your ear wow what a concept they are also very comfortable due to the fact i forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing the cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket if you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie better too much than not enough so back to the closet with the sony i guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks i couldn t have made a better choice for the money and quality you should do the same another quick note the shipping went great not too long at all and with standard usps thanks amazon	positive
in the ten minutes since i ve had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off more importantly it can t handle large manuals as advertised \( the reason i purchased this particular book holder \) my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter based on that i estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages if you don t anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on keep an eye on the page retainers \( these are the parts that fell off \) and you should be ok as for me i m off to read amazon s return policy and see if i can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic	negative

i had looked at numerous stands for my yamaha keyboard and didn t want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand \( at professional prices \) with that in mind the yamaha pkbx2 double x portable keyboard stand is a good choice at 29 99 i had seen other stands that were not as sturdy \( single x stands \) and cost about the same price tips for assembly don t read the instructions just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on amazon and assemble the stand the way it s shown the bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand use the \( included \) allen wrench to remove them pros low price solid sturdy stand works for just about any keyboard the stand s height is fully adjustable and can be done in several seconds without having to unscrew anything cons there is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand no screws bolts or straps are included even though most \( including my yamaha \) keyboards have pre drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand the keyboard simply sits on top of the stand i was very disappointed about this the included allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts the bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool the allen wrench only stripped the bolt it did not loosen it luckily my husband had a better allen wrench of nearly identical size and that one worked without it we would not have been able to loosen the bolt	positive

the sennheiser pmx70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others i d used recently i had high hopes on first listen however these semi in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes i later took them on a 40 minute run the design is such that in any position i adjusted them the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear once i started perspiring my sweat poured right into the little speakers i had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces the right speaker was filled with sweat and non functional pretty much the entire run who designed these consider these headphones only if you 1 \) never plan to exercise while using them and 2 \) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less	negative

the good when i first heard about this board i was incredibly excited i have been playing bf2 \( battlefield 2 \) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys so it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game the interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that i have seen but the price for each is kind of high but well worth it the bad the board is constructed well but don t expect this to replace your home keyboard the windows keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run of the mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with \( i might be biased since i have a msoft ergonomic split keyboard \) in game typing is difficult at best \( with the gaming keysets \) with most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1 2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1 2 side they are all vertical \( not staggered like u j and m keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other \) the keys feel a little cheap when you push them down they don t bounce back as much the ugly about 2 weeks after i purchases this board \( and the bf2 keyset \) 9 keys went completely dead i tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to no avail i contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that i have a faulty base unit duh they are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day maybe this post is premature but i don t think i am getting a new base unit conclusion the expression great idea bad execution holds true here my opinion don t buy this board ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that doesn t do anything but look good	negative
the pros you can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it s adhesive it allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well doesn t prohibit any functions of the ipod \( i e sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on \) the cons bubbles bubbles bubbles i ve carefully applied and re applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime especially on the screen if the screen is not lit up all you can see is bubbles on the screen it doesn t do the ipod justice because it looks so cheap when applied after 2 days with this product i m already looking to replace it	negative

i agree that this drive can be a little slow but it hasn t caused a problem for me i keep copies of many files \( about 1 gb total \) related to a large project at work on mine when i first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes but now i just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that i don t even notice them \( just a second or two \) i also seemlessly work on the files on both a pc at work and a mac at home to me the best feature is the reliability between my husband and i we ve had several cruzer minis in various sizes and each one has worked great even through accidental abuse one of his 512 mb drives accidently went through the washing machine we thought the data was gone but when it dried out it worked fine just today i found my 2 gb drive at the bottom of the dryer it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer yep it still worked i m buying a new one to replace it \( just in case \) because i don t know it there might be some long term effects from the water and heat but i ll keep using this one for less important applications changes are good though that it ll never have a problem these things are amazingly reliable	positive

before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	negative
the cord design of these is terrible you ll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from your right ear to your attachment point this is especially agravating for right handed individual \( pshh hardly any of those \) why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player \( or whatever \) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short i always use the extra extended cable which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use the sound is good for the price \( doesn t compare to my normal set of headphones \) but sporadically i feel like they are hurting my ears \( not in a physical sense \) i have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or \( more than likely as i ve never had this before with other headphones \) improper sound design of the speakers question is though would i spend the 30 amazon asks for them yes as they are definately the best in that price range but don t go to best buy or circuit city to get them as the price will be too high i expected more from sony	negative

as the ps2 does not have hdmi outputs for high definition tv s the monster cable gamelink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more you d have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard \( red white yellow \) av cables picture clarity they are in two different worlds and monster fully delivers however your tv must have component \( red blue green \) inputs for this cable to be useful ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your ps2 to your compatible tv receiver these cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable therefore you ll have to forget using the single plug in the ps2 offers for both audio and video however your sound will be uncompressed fully digital audio this is definitely a plus rather than a negative any mid priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input	positive
i m sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if i had used it i have found samsung products to be very good i did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my xm satellite radio subscription i already am paying costs for two radios i purchased this item to have more portable capabilities but i did not want to incur an additional charge on my xm account consequently i returned the product without using it	negative

i recently purchased this as a replacement for my monster cable i must say that i am quite impressed this is the best fm transmitter i have encountered i live in seattle there is a fairly saturated fm dial and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals that said i only have minor problems with interference the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges functionality is pretty much seamless in my car i drive a 2003 ford focus the 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash cd changer so accessibility is not an issue if anyone is in the market for an fm transmitter for their ipod i highly recommend this one that ll do pig that ll do	positive

i sincerely hope ipods have improved i bought a 30g ipod photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently outside the warranty \( which of course goes from original purchase date not replacement date \) it s kaput again now if i have to pay 275 for apple to fix or replace a three month old player no way three players on the blink each after a few months that isn t just bad luck that isn t even mentioning the difficulties with the itunes software or if you change computers i get a new pc and have to re transfer 100s of cds how lame that negates all the convenience of the large capacity \( i wish other mp3 players had the storage space the ipods have \) i just can t justify spending more money to replace this limited inferior pos again so essentially over the last year i have spent about 1 a day to have a player and now i m left with nothing i will be buying a different player i will spend far less than 275 and get something that will last more than three months is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use obviously not an ipod unfortunately i can t transfer the music i spend hours and hours loading up \( over and over \) what a waste of money and time	negative

i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices \( all had the same description and specs \) it worked for about 2 weeks and then quit a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose since then it has come loose twice more so i just don t use it anymore when it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution	negative
the case looks great and fits well but it s nearly impossible to remove i had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time i was afraid of hurting both the case and the ipod in addition it s too wide in the case to dock in my logitech speaker system i might have considered keeping it if i could have just snapped the case off for docking	negative

i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises but it works nonetheless and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections but i suspect it s related to where i have things in the house no so much the product in fact i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine it s compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed can t complain especially for the price	positive

i ve had this phone less than a week but i have been pleased with it s performance so far the set up was somewhat tricky as many if not all skype addresses use a period in the address none of the literature showed how to find the period by accident i noticed it was available on the 1 button after discovering that the installation went flawlessly if one is already familiar with the use of the alpha numeric keypad one would have no problems if one is learning on this phone with the literature provided one needs help the phone has worked well with both the landline and the skypeout alternatives i m pleased enough that i m buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones	positive

this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too	negative
i purchased the casio keyboard for my grand daughter s 4th birthday she really enjoyed playing it as a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day it is the perfect size for a small child she sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms the only thing that wasn t perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it	positive

ok i bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain hey 5gb for less than 100 what a deal once you get the hang of loading and working with the windows media player its not a big deal to load unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs \( which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs \) you get really good at it had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the hd and no longer worked at all i thought maybe the reason was that i had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better right so i stupidly bought a brand new one again less than 100 this one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and i just recently got the not recognizing the hd message i am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight i am 0 2 with these players so i don t believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back beware of this product	negative

my first and main complaint about this product is that it does not fit the 60gb ipod video the 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb and this case won t close around the 60gb ipod a secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb ipod from shocks there is no protection for the screen it s just a hole in the case \( like the hole for using the wheel \) and i just require more protection for my video ipod a third \( minor \) complaint is that there s a non removable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket i m returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too	negative

do not buy this product it is incredibly slow by far the slowest usb drive out of the dozen or so that i ve used it handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files i attempted to copy 50mb \( 1500 files 800 directories \) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy that s roughly 27k second deleting the files was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything for kicks i popped in an old 128 mb kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds bottom line is don t be fooled by the drive s small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesn t perform	negative
i needed a replacement receiver for a fairly modest home theater system i wanted a bare bones 5 1 system \( no 6 1 7 1 1kw audio power satellite radio capable etc \) i only use the receiver as an audio switch and let the tv handle video source selection reviewers of the sherwood rd 6500 liked the audio but thought the set up a little confusing being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me the price was certainly right about the cheapest thing around \( at \) i bought the unit and have been completely satisfied i would have given it five stars but heck nobody s perfect i had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality \( full disclosure my ears are 79 years old \) the unit has one optical digital one coax digital and several a v inputs the remote lets you pick video 1 3 cd tuner and aux inputs you tell the system which audio source to use for each of these one time and it remembers i liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present i was surprised to find how many premium hd movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in hd either i also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them on the negative side i like other reviewers bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub woofer is required	positive
i had an optoma h27 but felt it was lacking the brightness i liked on tv and i heard that hd72 was much better so i returned my h27 to costco and got the hd6800 which is costco s version of the hd72 wow much better hardly describes it the brightness is incredible and the detail and colors are truly remarkable the other night i was trying out different dvds just to see what they looked like on the new system and i was totally blown away while it does upscale dvd images to look better on its system i also bought a sony upscaling dvd player and there is a significant improvement with it with the hdmi connection i had read that since they are both upscaling the dvd player s upscaling wouldn t be necessary but i do find the image through the upscaling dvd the best in a side by side test using two sony dvd players and two dvds of the recently restored carousel using component s video and hdmi at the same time all connected to the hd72 i saw clearer detail on faces coming from the hdmi upscaling dvd player i was so impressed i felt like pulling in people from the street to see it but i fought the impulse because i don t want to share it with anyone with a little tweaking of the menus new films like star wars iii and sin city showed incredible detail and older films like the adventures of robin hood were gorgeous in their technicolor glory i highly recommend the hd72	positive
i had a 1st generation shuffle and upgraded to a 60gb video which i adore however i found that whenever i went running i was stealing my old shuffle back from my daughter i bought this shuffle for my husband and fell in instant love with it i really like how portable it is and you can t beat being able to just clip it onto your clothing no arm straps no more lanyards so now i have the 60 gig for my entire library of music and videos and the shuffle for exercise	positive
we used this remote to program a sony av rm3000 remote but we need more flexibility for our htpc in hindsight we should have bought a stand alone ir unit and something like the girder software or maybe just an ir wireless keyboard this is not a remote for those seeking flexibility or those who like to customize their media experience this is an excellent remote for those who want out of the box usability and don t want to bother with customization it s well built and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for pros comfortable shape sensible layout high quality feel reasonably compatible with many programs cons doesn t do absolutely everything in every compatible application only four somewhat programmable keys with limited option	positive

i bought this deck about 6 months ago it has performed flawless in every aspect as soon as i turned it on i could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck i have taken all of my cd s out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface the ipod function is flawless and easy to use just plug in your ipod and search by artist album song title or playlist this can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so i would suggest using playlists the output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment this deck is the best overall i have ever listened to	positive
i just got mine from amazon \( after a lengthly delay \) it is an awesome memory card it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras i tested it on the camera and it worked great the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp no issues there the card worked flawlessly i ve already used up 600 mb its a must buy plus at 99 99 its much less than other retailers btw i ordered it at 104 99 then contacted amazon about the price drop they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one day shipping at no charge because of the delay overall great service too	positive

we had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam we would get an error message and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while we finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program after i had to ask to speak to a supervisor \( the tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when i had already installed several before contacting them \) we have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again the ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working we still haven t addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem i hope hp reviews comments on this website occasionally i would like them to know i have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position also hp tech support is very difficult to deal with at best i talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible english i am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported hp are you listening	negative

i had researched for a long time before i finally made my purchase the final reasons for this purchase was the consumer reports best buy recommendation for the larger 42 version of this olevia set i had debated about purchasing a tv with 1080 but decided against doing so when i read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720 i needed the 37 set due to the entertainment center we already owned which cost 2 5 times the price of the tv so it wasn t leaving the house the tv opening would have allowed a 40 but i am glad i stayed with the 37 because the set up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40 because of the need to turn the set at angles i compared the two tvs at the olevia site and the only difference was the speakers i also saw the olevia at a friend s house and was impressed with the quality the best price was found through amazon com i placed my order on a friday evening and the set was delivered by ups in perfect condition on wednesday the set up of the tv was simple the only problem i experienced was with the remote here s the good news i sent an email to tech support and quickly i had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that i set up the tv even though i use the surround sound through our stereo i actually was satisfied with the sound through the tv speakers a small problem is that the time warner cable box remote control does not operate the tv so we do have to use multiple remotes but that s only a minor inconvenience our family has been very pleased with the tv i would highly recommend this tv to anyone purchasing this size tv	positive
the pci bus does not have the bandwidth to get you gigabit speed you will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a pci gigabit card even with jumbo frames your motherboard has two pci busses and sometimes has three depending on the chipset and the manufacturer the internal devices like the keyboard mouse floppy internal network usb firewire and more will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses you will have to run sisoft sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the pci bandwidth it can get but that will not be close to gigabit speed either best case on 33 mhz pci is 300 megabit even if you can find which pci bus has the fewest bandwidth consuming devices on it the 33 mhz pci busses in all consumer pcs cannot handle the bandwidth of this \( or any \) gigabit card anyway if you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 mhz pci pci x \( not pci express \) 64 bit pci or similar but you re going to pay lots of money for that worse yet that built in gigabit interface might still be on a 33 mhz pci bus and always sharing bandwith giving you less than 300 megabit speed it probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework	negative

after ruining another pair of over the head headphones i decided to check these out they are actually on sale at 50 off and i ve just tried mine out the audio is very sharp especially with the base though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair i can just increase the volume to compensate at 35 this is a great deal they feel great the band that most headphones have presses down on your head but not too much it also folds down quite nicely though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress haven t tried out the actual noise cancellation feature but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent then it will work just as well it also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your mp3 player if you so wished however it easily fits into a jacket pocket great great great design and comfort	positive

the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas even then if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it s going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work mostly you can t use this with a cover on and you ll need a car charger if you want to use it for long the all in one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution	negative
in general i ve been happy with belkin accessories but this cable is the pits it lasted less than a month i used it to connect my hd dvr cable box to my receiver no crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent i don t like to support the monster cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty i bought their cable to replace this one so far no problems	negative
i wanted a non ipod digital music player and found this to be a terrific option it plays a number of different formats and includes a lanyard which is nice when commuting on the train or for plane travel i have only used alkaline batteries so far and have had excellent battery life the menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu it s pretty easy i have also enjoyed the built in fm tuner and have not any trouble with reception even on a moving commuter train the sound quality is very good i ve been using 128 bitrate mp3 songs so far the software for transferring music is pretty easy to use although i did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue the included earbuds aren t the most comfortable especially since i already lost the foam padding but i will probably get a better pair anyway they do sound good though also the included cases are pretty cheesy and i didn t even bother with them a little hint one thing i did not like was that because of the location of the on button the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket to combat this simply turn the hold on the unit won t turn on accidentally when it s on	positive
i purchase this on amazon for 499 no tax free shipping you can not match this quality at this price the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color i looked at samsung for 800 and i am glad i saved myself 300 with this lcd	positive
i have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts all in all pretty pleased with the purchase it was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my ipod mini there are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models panicked at first because they didn t have one for the mini but it was already installed on the model cons light dimmer has three settings but even the lowest is too bright you can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote no ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week for example 7 00am monday to friday no alarm on weekends wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset \( by you \) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle sound is great for an alarm clock don t think it will compare with a mini stereo or bose sounddock would buy again at the price	positive

i really don t have much to say about this book holder not that it s just a book holder it s a nice one it does it s job it s a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic it s strong sturdy and it s big enough even for those massive heavy textbooks like the calculus ones although i would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that s like 6 thick \( even though it still may hold \) it s got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place although those tend to fall off when you move them but that s no big deal just put them back on this book holder is kind of big and i would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom but it s not too big you should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time	positive

for the first few weeks it worked fine however it started skipping and stopping dvds after two months i called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty no case number was given at the time the unit was shipped via ups and received on 92nd days from the purchase date and they charged 50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired i called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because i don t have case number issued within warranty period in addition please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well next place for my dvd player trashcan sigh go buy another brand with 1 year warranty unless you purchase extended warranty along with this unit pros cheap dual screen comes with gaming pad detachable screens which is very easy to use cons sub lcd screen isn t sharp as main i thought it was defective for the first time all the games are outdate	negative
after reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my ipod i had read a lot about how it interefered with the usb cable or the hold switch but i couldn t argue with the price i must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket ipod products i have puchased it does exactly what it is supposed to do protect my ipod i have no trouble opperating any of the ipod s buttons and i simply remove the case when i charge the unit i have not found that it impairs the functionality of the ipod at all while keeping it securely around my neck it is perfect for jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites i find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion ultimately it perfectly protects my ipod when i am out and about which is what it was designed to do the reasons i gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little and i whished they had mounted the ipod right side up like they did on the nano model over all i am well please	positive

with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc \( they had just received them that day \) sorry amazon but the nano did come from you anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible it works great it fits snugly in this case yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls i have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all the belt clip is sturdy and secure the magnetic snap for closing it works great the case can be closed with headphones attached but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod	positive
this product costs too much for being such poor quality i can literally just pull the cord apart bare handed without using barely any force at all and after it s torn apart there is no hope of repairing it no matter how much time effort and thought you put into it it s impossible i m pretty sure that it s inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another the only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality and their comfort the sound quality sounds a little better than the normal ipod earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore but if you plan on using these while you re leading a busy active life i guarantee that they wont last a week i heard that these earphones are the best i found out that they are indeed some of the worst and sadly i found that out the hard way	negative

this was my first gps system of any kind i wasn t sure what to expect i have a small mazda miata so i wanted a small screen gps that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint i was afraid that the screen would be too small but it s perfect i don t think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space i live in new york city and before putting it in my car i walked with the gps unit in my hands perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal i was convinced it was defective it s not once i put it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes this unit comes with a 128mb micro sdcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time i ordered a 1gb micro sdcard along with this gps \( for approx 11 on amazon \) and loaded all of north america at one time this eliminates the need to re load maps when traveling anywhere in the country it s worth the extra effort this unit can be quickly moved from one car to another especially a rental car anywhere in north america my very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern manhattan and the bronx it was flawless it s impossible to get lost with this thing occasionally i ve made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re calculate the best route the combination of the voice prompts the highlighted route you need to go and the current and next street \( s \) at the top are excellent also the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice but does not account for traffic jams the arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel it s kind of a best traffic scenario prediction this is so easy to use i m thinking of buying one for my 68 year old mother who doesn t have a clue when it comes to technology but i m convinced she could use this without a problem \( once i ve loaded the maps for her \) if not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a gps system doesn t bother you \( as it doesn t bother me \) buy this you won t be sorry	positive

the lexar jumpdrive lightning 2gb flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160x \( 24mb sec \) sustained read and 120x \( 18mb sec \) sustained write speed capability this is one of the very few usb drives that lists the read write speed capabilities the reality of flash drives is that the smaller the file size the slower the transfer rate will be i ran some tests with the lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes 433mb 784 medium files avg 550kb 12x 4 min 3 sec 483mb 81 large files avg 6mb 54x 59 seconds 1gb 1 very large file 115x 58 seconds so even though the write speed capability of the lightning is 120x the transfer rate drops to 12x with medium size files which is fairly real world usage but don t let that dissuade you from considering the lightning the higher the speed capability of the device the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files to prove this point i took one of my great deal cf cards \( that had no speed ratings \) that tops out at 36x read 7x write and ran two of the same tests 433mb 784 medium files 3x 15 min 10 sec 483mb 81 large files 7x 7 min 48 sec so compared to the lightning the great deal card took nearly 4 times longer to write the medium files and 8 times longer to write the large files so which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a usb flash drive if the performance numbers are not specified beware what you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing i know i have several in my drawer so my bottom line advice is look for the highest rated device you can find flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow so future proof your purchase by shopping for a high rated and large capacity for now and the future \( i have no relationship with lexar or the flash memory industry	positive
i bought this product to hang a 42 lcd i am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns the mount is only 32 wide the virtual axis tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me there are only two tilt options with this mount vertical \( hugs wall nicely \) and the 5 degree being 32 wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16 centers make sure you get at least 2 studs my experience is this mount does not support vesa 400x800mm pattern 800mm is 31 5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than 30 apart my tv did have another attaching pattern but i had to use the m5 bolts \( provided with mount \) i would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where i could use the thicker m8 bolts a 42 lcd isn t going to weigh as much as a 50 tv so take that into consideration i am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy	positive

after looking around at the local stores \( fry s and compusa \) i had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my ipod in multiple environments on my belt and also in exercise and had resigned myself to having a skin type case for just everyday use and then shifting the ipod to an arm band for exercise not a particularly great solution expensive \( around 20 for each \) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses then i ran into the dlo action jacket at best buy which seemed to cover all my intended uses unlike the prior reviewer i found my 40g ipod fits very snugly absolutely zero slop and i really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case also at 29 95 it s cheaper than the two case approach the only criticism i have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case the process is a little tedious but the end result is great the unit feels very secure on my arm and it s easy to forget that it s there this jacket is a winner	positive

i ve used the sd yd250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear overall the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor saving convenience i ve used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough it can also save a lot of money provided you purchase the yeast in bulk \( for example 2lb \) the single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough this takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza and when the dough is refrigerated for later use it tastes even better in my opinion like most engineered products of our age this one is full of cute features that add little value or cause annoyance the yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best if you use it you \( for the most part \) create extra work for yourself because you ll have to clean it later the dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use they make a marginal difference in baking results i only use the quick bake mode which takes 2 hours to complete let s say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings \( easy to do given the many parameters you can set \) you just push the reset or cancel button and start over right nope no such button exists then unplug the unit and plug it back in right nope the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages so the unit remembers where it left off yes but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes and after 10 minutes it will forget right nope i tried this too the unit does indeed forget eventually but it s more than 11 minutes if you plug it back too early the timer resets and you have to wait again to summarize the hardware is excellent and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber	positive

i bought this alarm clock today \( april 7 2007 \) at bed bath and beyond for 10 i wish i had seen the reviews first i bought it because of the product name small size and variety of options unfortunately i realized it wasn t a great buy when i brought it home and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on the connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn t stay in place the clock light is pointless it s supposed to help you see the time in the dark but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry actually the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off as for the alarm it s pretty quiet if you re a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment this is not the clock for you you ll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear a final note on this product the clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems but only with the battery cover slightly open if i close the cover all the way the clock shuts off if you want an alarm clock that will last awhile i suggest buying something else you get less than you pay for with this model	negative

this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference but to see the beam \( not just the dot at the end of the beam \) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of	positive

i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years i purchased three for my mac and pc at home then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit currently only one still works i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd i can t comment on other ups brands such as belkin but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc s popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand my experience over the past four years has been mixed these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor battery life depends on many factors so i don t begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable i bought apc branded batteries and can t explain why the recurrent failures i m frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups	negative

i don t know what the fuss is all about about this unit s fan noise after the firmware update if one bothers to do o it the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of huge storage space \( or data redundancy if one should choose to use raid 1 \) the sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a pc workstation \( one of those dell precisions or macpro powermacs \) one of the things i wish could be different about the unit is if the raid configuration could be more easily managed by using apple s disk utility instead of using wd s own proprietary software \( which requires a reboot an annoying thing on mac osx 4 which i almost never ever have to reboot \) and then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized hello western digital mac is no microsoft windows where users are used to rebooting often if you want more of mac users business write your apps like a true osx app at most i should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities other than that the unit is a work horse i use superduper to backup my mac and so far have had no issues at all with it	positive

i did a lot of research not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later i was about to buy the newest 40 720p samsung for 1899 then i stumbled upon this one at circuit city for 1999 and bought it on the spot paid about 50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later i ve had it a week now and i love it standard definition picture quality is just okay but are any of us buying these tvs to watch sdtv i get about 15 hd channels through my cable company including all four major networks plus espn espn2 and a couple music and movie channels therefore a majority of everything i watch is available in hd anyway sdtv content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10 12 feet hd content looks awesome \( including black levels \) and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p i can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available i m going to wait another year or two for the high definition dvd format war to play out before i buy a blu ray or hd dvd player but i ve watched standard definition dvd on my xbox with this tv and the picture is beautiful i m sure high definition dvd would look a little better in a side by side comparison but you will not have any complaints watching standard definition dvd on this tv in short this is an excellent tv especially compared to other 1080p models in its size range if you re looking for something in the range of 2000 2200 this is the one you want enjoy	positive

i purchased this printer for it s fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum but it s really been a let down the printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out so now i have to send 3 copies of everything i want to the printer wasting paper and ink i ve tried different kinds of paper and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at brother but it continues to do this i ve looked around the internet and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models it s really an inconvenience and now i have to purchase a new printer because it s such a pain if you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use this is the printer for you otherwise avoid at all costs	negative

i had an old palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer but it ate batteries and wasn t rechargeable so when i got a newer computer without a serial port \( and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial usb connector \) i decided to upgrade thought it d be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well \( i don t own an ipod or other small mp3 player \) but i didn t need many features beyond an organizer \( didn t need for e mail etc \) and didn t want to spend much over 75 pros i like the palm interface very intuitive calendar contacts work well plays mp3 s syncs well with outlook computer plugs in to recharge all cords came with it easy to download new software \( i recommend blocks it s similar to tetris \) cons or caveats display when viewing calendar in full month mode i have trouble seeing any entries unless i view the screen at an angle not a deal breaker but a little odd they probably improved this with newer \( pricier \) models but you get what you pay for i can read all other screens just fine haven t used it to display photos i don t think i d use this to do that resolution isn t worth the effort expansion card warning will not read any card over 1gb size \( i had purchased a 2gb card with the intent of putting mp3 s on it and listening to them on the zire wouldn t read it didn t realize this till i read the fine print fortunately i have a camera which takes sd cards so i can use in the camera \) listening to mp3 s this really isn t gonna replace an ipod for features they do say that listening to mp3 s uses more battery than other functions i would agree but then i ve not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player so i can t really say functionally mp3 s play just fine with realone player sound quality is pretty good but i have noticed a hiss background noise when using earbud style headphones it s a lot less noticeable with outside the ear style headphones recommendation outside the ear style headphones with an in line \( cord \) volume control if you re in a quiet environment the lowest volume level on the realone player isn t all that soft with non volume adjustment headphones the lowest volume level \( there s a slider bar on screen \) was the loudest i wanted to hear headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem overall it s been worth the for me as a replacement for my former m100 and it works ok as an mp3 player as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis	positive
i ve owned three of interlink s units but that was before competitors came to market with well designed units the interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily there is no off switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one s pocket the advance and go back buttons function most of the time but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2 3 times per 30 minute presentation although i agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this interlink product better than i do it seems these other reviewers have not compared the interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features for example the kensington pointer is half the price the case is sturdy has a no slip outer coating has a comfortable feel in the hand and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip and the advance and go back buttons function all of the time not just most of the time	negative
if you zoom in on the picture you ll notice that it s actually 16 gauge wire i received it and can confirm that it s 16 gauge wire works fine although the spool that s held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing it s not a big deal though and my only disappointment was on my end when i realized 100 wasn t enough to hook up my 7 speakers	positive
this kit is neat i have to admit that it comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book however the kit itself is a little pricey considering that a \) there s only 10 pages b \) the pages are only 5 x 7 and c \) the pages are not double sided the software included although as simple and easy to use as can be is so limiting it doesn t actually feel like you have made this book yourself instead it s as though you re in preschool bringing in the pictures and having teacher put it together for you you can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please but there is seldom the precise one that you really want it doesn t help that half of the themes have these cutesy scrap book elements that look absolutely ridiculous however the book itself is pretty slick once you make many many comprimises the only reason i gave this two stars is for the materials included	negative
pros very inexpensive can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 player cons can t shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash drive overall i m very happy with this device i live in a big city and had no trouble finding an fm station with little to no interference i love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time the sound quality is good but not perfect similar to playing a cassette instead of a cd for the low price i can t complain though	positive

i have had this item for about 6 weeks haven t used to a lot but so far i like it this power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things it has one electrical outlet and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in the plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet but i don t know if that s the plug or the outlet on my car the only thing i don t like about this item is the no tangle cord its one of those coiled up cords like a telephone cord \( look at the picture of the item \) the cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat but if i were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet its coiled so tight that i couldn t really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched it just annoys me that they call it a 36 cord for practical use not more than probably 18 but i don t have the item right in front of me to measure it i ll still give this item 5 stars 4 5 if amazon allowed 1 2 stars	positive

the six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product i purchased this to use as an interface between a cd walkman player and the ac power cord the heads have specific polarity so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly however if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated it s not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time i found the product to work effectively the only negative i can see is that the actual plug in device is a bit bulky so if you want to use this in a power strip setting the ah3wh can be a bit of a plug hog however other than that limitation the product was reliable recommended to save on those batteries which do add up	positive

one of the few of these type of items available on the market i bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews i had received some free drives from newegg \( seagate \) and needed to house them this was a no brainer set up the utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off \( xp pro sp2 \) the firmware was one rev prior so i updated it absolutely smooth as silk reformatted the drives i chose the raid 1 option and ext3 format i like the fact that you can specify raid size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume the drive is fairly solid the fan is not very noisy the front slide up access door is a little kludgy good user interface i was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen raid and ext3 the only thing i can never get to work and it is 100 my lack of knowledge is the email alerts i couldn t get infrant to do it and same with this one as an aside i love amazon and newegg great retailers both of them	positive

wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear gic251u 5 port usb card on a dell optiplex gx 1 running 98se \( this computer already has 2 usb 1 1 ports \) the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a inf file in the iogear supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand alone program this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager however the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going installed card seemed to work ok for a d link wireless adapter but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non iogear 1 1 ports the following actions did not help \( 1 \) swapping the card to another pci slot \( 2 \) downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website \( 3 \) three calls to customer support where i found sympathy but so solution	negative
i gave a detailed review of the base system but the handset merits comments separately i have purchased handsets for every room in the house and because i don t like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere i use them they re easily customizable through the pc interface although they can be customized without it as well each handset gets its out name so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple \( no more trying to remember which room has the fifth handset \) i ve been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset i ve read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality but i ve had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios if you re shopping for one of these then you ve already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it so you know the quality to expect i think the uniden clx485 is the best residential phone system i ve ever experienced the handset lives up to that standard too	positive

after my trusty archos player s display broke i figured i upgrade and get me a 60gb iaudio x5 as a journalist doing interviews i was also very giddy to get the line in to record interviews straight to mp3 a friend of mine loves his player so i didn t even flinch when i saw the price ever since then i regret my decision apparently my player has a software problem it speeds up all my mp3 files i tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing that is when i was actually able to upload mp3s because oftentimes i received error messages and the player refused to do as told so what then upgrade the firmware sure if you can make it work and i couldn t the description online is poorly written but it s essentially like this start with a fully loaded battery unplug the a c cabel and unpload the firmware now replug the a c cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware well all it does is conclude that the battery isn t full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else i e i couldn t get the firmware to update and i tried for the last hour therefore i ll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund and i ll get another archos and continue to live with its misely 20gb	negative
looking at the photo of this item i noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is not the screw on contraption needed for my explorist 400 so i was hesitant to purchase it until i did further research and found out why the plug is different you still need the usb cable that came with the explorist and have to bring it in the car too the big ac plug detaches from the usb cable and aha now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into then you screw that cable onto your gps unit as when you charge it via ac in other words this charger does not plug into your gps it plugs into your gps charger cable which attaches to your gps but i don t want to take that cable in the car with me because if it gets damaged or lost then i can never charge the unit at all not even at home with ac so i was forced to find and purchase another usb cable assembly seperately to keep in the car with this car lighter charger magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it the car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord but what good is it you still have to have the long usb cable attached to it anyway but hopefully this will help everyone that like me was puzzled by the photo of the item and the connector that isn t going to fit anywhere in the explorist 400	negative

this is my second projector i used an nec for the last four years but that died on me recently and boy am i glad it died i am amazed by the quality of the ax100u the pictures and colors almost jump off the screen at you also the oft mentioned ldc projector screen door effect is virtually non existant you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it i believe panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it the contrast is also truely outstanding for an lcd projector at par with dlp systesm but without the headaches of the rainbow effect couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users when i first started using the projector with my dvd player i was getting some wavy curls \( not too visible but still there \) that seemed to flow across the screeen however after about 4 5 hours of use they have disappeared so if any of you see those wavy curls just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well secondly unlike my old nec i was getting a flickering shimmer when using my hd box from my cable company the shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture there is an easy fix for this go to options overscan and you can actually crop the edge of the image and not see it any more voila no flickers and an incredible picture be aware that this is big bulky projector compared to some others out there definately not a portable one you don t want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures this was designed as a dedicated home theater projector not a portable presentation device i highly recommend this projector you ve got to see the picture to believe it i didn t think it was possible at this price range	positive

after enduring the so so performance of my stock ipod headphones i figured it was time to step up as i travel constantly i wanted something that would would block out exterior noise as a music freak i wanted something that would sound great after countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get \( ue vs shure vs etymotics \) i bought the super fi 5 pros in the end it was the price amazon was selling then for 90 less than the msrp can t beat that as soon as they were delivered i hooked them up and put them on they aren t kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down i keep the volume on my ipod way down a fraction of what i kept it at with the stock headphones the room i was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement with the ues on it was just me and the music a fire engine thundered by normally a painfully annoying experience again the ues reduced it to the point that i didn t realize the fire engine was coming until i saw it drive by as for the music i first played a couple of tracks by jenny lewis and the watson twins i immediately noticed elements to the music i never even heard with my other headphones jenny lewis angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like i was listening to them for the first time next i put on some ray charles with the ues it was like i was there in the front row the horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while i discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section i ve read complaints that in ear headphones don t produce enough bass so i decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from siamese twin by the smashing pumpkins while i m not by any means a bass head i need some bass to enjoy rock albums i couldn t have been happier with how the ues performed the drums in the album \( which i ve always considered some of the best \) came alive the guitars actually had some balls but didn t overpower the singing or drums as is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time your ears are bound to hurt a little i found this to be the case only for a day or two after that the ues fit snugly without any complaint the only weird thing i encountered had to do with ear wax my wife an audiologist forbids the family from using q tips so after taking the ues off for the first couple of times there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones like the discomfort this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times i used the ues and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue when there are so many excellent products out there finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging i ve never tried on shures or etymotics so i can t compare the performance of those headphones and the ues what i do know is that i got a really great deal on the best headphones i ve ever had without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones i will buy for some time	positive

the lp to digital recording system is nothing more than a record player just a vanilla run of the mill record player you still need a sound card in order to record your lps most builtin \( on the motherboard \) sound cards have very poor audio input so this product is not suited to its advertized function i am reminded of the solar clothes dryer product of a couple of years back the box contained a rope and some clothespins the software is awkward and hard to use not at all intuitive it also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy any buyer would be better off getting audacity \( freely available on the net \) which is easy to use and has the same features i do not recommend this product	negative
great features with the microsoft mouse wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier comes with a usb dongle that i did not want to use so i was determined to get this mouse working with the built in bluetooth in my new dell latitude notebook found that the toshiba drivers provided by dell for the bluetooth would not work with the microsoft mouse seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of bluetooth devices go figure had to delete the toshiba drivers and let xp with sp 2 provide the drivers and it works great pros great features no cord long battery life between charges \( days \) very responsive cons some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle bigger than i like to pack around for a notebook	positive

my girl and boy both love their players the really likes the sonic games and the ability to connect it to the tv on a tv the 8 bit graphics are jagged but he does not care and the games are playable the builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything the players have a nice lock feature to disable the controls so that the movie is not accidentally stopped they have both dropped the players serveral times and they both continue to work well the only problem is that the had figured out how to remove the battery pack she does this at times then gets upset the movie stopped the players come with everything ac and auto adapters a remote control earphones built in stand battery pack and the wires to play the movies and the games directly on an a tv with rca jacks	positive
i purchased the cyberpad 8 5x11 digital notepad with the expectation that i would be able to digitize my sketches and notes i made at work unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations the first unit that i received did not function the usb connection to the pad was defective \( the connector would not insert all the way hone \) i returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned as far as being functional that is another story i proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer either way the unit produced images that were useless the lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge i let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer s design i would say that this is one technology that is not ready for prime time	negative

this sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don t have your laptop or a dictionary handy the interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best i ve ever used on this type of device moreover the access times for dictionary and thesaurus lookups are very fast the phrase search function is a little bit slower but not intolerable there are also crossword puzzle and anagram solver functions that i have not used but i imagine work fine another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single aaa battery not some watch type cell battery the only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries hopefully sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the pw e550 i believe this is by far the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than 100 and no i do not work for sharp electronics	positive

i bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week it works great when i registered the unit on line i found that magellan s website showed there were software updates for this unit \( roadmate 2000 \) i downloaded the update and after some difficulty i was able to perform the upgrade i then found that the voice prompts no longer worked i logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct i verified all of my settings and finally called magellan support the support group was hard to understand \( they are located in india \) and were unable to help me i asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say they asked that i upgrade the unit again \( although the screen showing the firmware and os versions showed the new version numbers \) but by this time i was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade this unit did not ship with an a c adapter i asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he \( tom \) informed me there was not i asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues i might experience with this upgrade and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions i asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 48 hours i was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after i told him i thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations he came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour it is well over an hour and no call so far i tried their corp office and was routed by an aru back to india i called their corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named marti who would not connect me to management she said she would send me to quality assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary i spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected i love the magellan gps units and i have three \( blazer 12 explorist 210 and the roadmate 2000 \) and each time i have had to call tech support i am very disappointed i have to say i will not recommend their products to anyone else since i am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers to be fair tom \( tech support \) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time however until then i have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever if my wife was not already used to the unit i would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer in summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don t expect good customer service if you need magellan s help	negative

i bought this mouse about three months ago and i love it it works on every surface and the scroller works well too the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short \( about 2 5 feet long \) and it plugs into the left hand side of my laptop which means that i only have about a foot to work with although i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left \( good deal for the left handed population i guess \) some people have complained about the wind up function for the cord getting tangled but i haven t had any problems with that	positive

i ve had this phone for approx 9 months now maybe longer and i truly don t know how i ve stood using this dual phone system for so long however tonight i ve taken a giant step upward towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx tg 5432m dual system this dual handset is the worst i ve ever experienced in a cordless system from the moment i set it up the static has been atrocious step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear i can t even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting not only to me but to the other person on the other end for they hear it too i will never purchase another uniden product if this is the non quality of product they put out i had a 2 4 mhz system that would outshine this system and i wish i d never gotten rid of it as the title says if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head uniden should be ashamed of this product stepping down from the soapbox now	negative

most annoying thing is that i hooked up through hdmi for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the hdmi \( i used optical \) what the hell is the deal with that at first i thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your tv or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well hdmi is supposed to make it more convenient 1 cable etc why is this necessary secondly my receiver is not working properly the sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99 of the time running the auto macc fails out manually i see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part surround left is silent as it should be occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm if i select the different output options basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing i am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as i do think the receiver is nice if its working i enjoy the ipod dock that has output to your tv as well i major concern is something is wrong with there hdmi circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well i will update when i get the replacement installed	negative

no free lunch you get what you pay for is that the verdict on this product well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it i need disc binders and the case logic brand while being the original is pricey low cost alternatives are needed but not at the expense of quality and tco \( total cost of ownership \) but the flap about poor customer service \( rebates \) and poor quality \( zippers and sleeve binding \) is enough to give me pause so if someone from xtreme s management is paying attention fix it or be content to lose business price isn t everything to everyone in the markt for your product	negative

i bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk and for that purpose it s an admirable phone plus the contrast adjustable lcd displays current date and time without you having to set it the buttons for call list browsing option setting etc are on the back of the receiver so you don t have to take the phone off the hook to use them the sound quality is great of course this being a corded phone and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand the keypad lights up although only for a few seconds dial fast in the dark the ring tone is nice at its medium setting minus i find the base a bit bulky the lcd has no background light and when the handset is set to hi volume you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base \( i keep the setting at lo though which is plenty loud \) my main gripe is that the phone doesn t have a voicemail indicator which would be extremely sweet with my phone company \( vonage \) also the caller id stuff works with batteries only at least they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone still four stars because the phone does all it says it does	positive

i bought a pair in january and loved them sound is as lovely as everyone describes however there are something seriously lacking in the build quality the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it but i thought i d just take extra care at 1 month of careful usage the plastic covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather hardened that i could almost use them as chopsticks and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion at 2 months of careful usage the wires had half ripped from the plug which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape however at 3rd month the left bud fell completely off i am very disappointed it is one of the best sounding phones i ve ever had \( i ve owned both grado s60 and s90 and sennheisers \) but man they need to do something about making this baby last	negative

i agree with the comments posted here like most of us i was interested in the bose sound yet put off by the prestige price even on e bay the going price ended up being around 400 for a used older model so i did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison shopper article that put the bose up against several competitors including this high end teac i have to say that i m entirely satisfied the chrome retro look is quite appealing and the model has a couple of features that for me beat out bose entirely i wanted a top loading door like the old bose models but also the ability to play mp3 like the new ones and this gave me both the sound and punch is remarkable at flat setting it is a bit bassy that s true but you get a 5 to 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment i set mine at 3 and 1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic 10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough and just remember to set it to a station \( or load a cd \) that you d want to be woken up to before calling it a night teac customer service i can t comment on but i bought a reconditioned unit from an amazon seller for less than 100 including shipping a sweet deal for a sweet machine	positive

i bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when i replaced my palm m105 with an hp ipaq the palm stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and i used in nearly every day after my positive experience i expected my new ir keyboard to function the same way what a dissapointment i can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me i found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation i usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys the little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the pda at all securely even bumping the table can knock it off and i have taken to using an elastic band to keep my ipaq in place the mouse arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard \( unlike the stowaway \) i will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search	negative

it says it supports mac all over the package however it doesn t support and cannot be made to support mac files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files for instance when i drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named ilegally or uses a prohibited character it says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt ok ok is your only choice to click on by clicking on ok the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder how is that for compatibility how is that for delivering backup assurance i feel swindled the product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box it s mac compatible as long as you adopt pc conventions in how you operate your mac run mac owners ru	negative

but the touch wheel is harder to use i bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it since that point time i had a harder time turning it off pausing adjusting the volume using the back and forth touch points and setting a stop point in a audiobook this is the result of the mini being recessed into the case i took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again the case will protect your mini without a doubt but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for also make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since i nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip i ll only use when absolutely necessary now	negative
i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition just a few months ago i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material or created a design where it won t rub against the laptop really stupid design it may have protected against some very minor scratches but likely i m worse off for using this cover \( scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity \) i don t think in the long run it was worth 40 and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money	negative

i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february today march 6th i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all 4 500 of them are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd s the player just wouldn t read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer service tech department of any computer electronic company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a 3rd or 4th language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can t believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2 3 days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don t plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1 2gb file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up 7 1gb after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i don t like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because 1 it plays all my music 2 they have a customer service tech support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff	negative
this salamander designs rack is very well made and looks great it takes a few hours to assemble but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there unfortunately amazon s shipping \( via ups \) didn t go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape i was hoping that the inner box would protect the item but alas one of the two doors was damaged i m now trying to get amazon to replace the door but they can only exchange the whole unit the shipping box is completely destroyed so i ve been forced to contact the manufacturer directly crossing my fingers	positive

there are many aspects of the t5 people want to count as negatives for me i consider them annoyances but not killers i would like to have wifi with my pda but i am not dead with out it more memory is always good but the t5 isn t on the hurting side it s not a good mp3 player with the memory it has and even if you have a 2g card with mp3 s it s not like this is what you would buy for mp3s but as far as contact information on the go applications etc i would consider this as good as any other the problem as i have just found out is these are known to die i haven t heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the t5 will at some point die it will lock up and even after all the resets listed from palm it will not come back to even a factory state you will have a palm powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top there are a couple of fixes if you are under warranty you can send it back to palm for them to make it better or you can remove the battery and solder it back this is a serious design issue that palm is more than happy to charge you for until i ran into this i would have rated this a 4 5 until this happened the device did what i expected it to do i read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no wifi but it has one of the fastest processors \( available at that time \) in a pda which was a different type of cool the bluetooth works well enough i haven t had any issues with it you can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn t really that big of a deal but if you can t trust your device is going to be working the next day it really doesn t matter what cool feature it has this has been a very expensive let down i don t want to buy another palm after this experience but i am not sure what to switch to	negative

i purchased the rino 130 specifically because it also had the radio and noaa features fortunately i read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance i tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible and i was able to return the unit to amazon in time for a full refund be sure to test this yourself also the buttons are very small and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down i returned the rino 130 and purchased a garmin etrex legend c \( color display \) for about the same price i will miss the noaa feature of the 130 but not the radio this is an overpriced gps spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed	negative

anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds i know because i just did it the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire you could even use household scissors to gnaw through having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer however if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer you might as well get something with a stronger cable	negative

i have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything i hoped for when i first opened the box it was shipped in i was very put off there was a very very strong chemical smell i chalked it up to something in the packaging material it turns out that was not where the smell was coming from it was the mouse pad itself having worked in a shoe factory years ago i was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue the smell hung around for a couple of days now 1 week after having received my purchase if i put my nose close to the pad it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue i would caution those with allergies and or asthma to consider this prior to purchase as an asthmatic i can say it did affect my breathing some what that seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened i have finished with my public health warning on to the mouse pad it is simply the best mouse pad i have ever used i have had wrist problems for over 4 years now i have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work in the past week my swelling has greatly reduced my pain is almost gone my wrist sits perfectly on the wrist rest the pad actually cradles my wrist the wrist rest moves with my hand so well and with so much support it seems to be an extension of my body a new improved appendage i have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk it truly is that comfortable i already have plans to purchase two more for friends as christmas gifts worth every cent go for it you will not be disappointed	positive

this monitor is an awesome buy i had no problems with my monitor dead pixel wise the only complaints i have to add are those that others have already voiced the stand does not securely fasten to the monitor it just sort of sits there a good push and down she may go the menu buttons on the right side aren t confusing to use my other monitors have used a similar setup menu activates menu and also activates a menu item up down change values menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit if i had put two of these monitors side by side i can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue minor but perhaps irksome i have not tested the speakers but seriously a good set of speakers won t set you back much that s not what this monitor is for i would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat if i didn t already have three monitors to begin with	positive

i read the other reviews some glowing others well not so glowing the price was right \( 149 50 rebate \) so i thought i would take a chance i read the other reviews so i have no one else to blame but myself first off i am only interested in playing videos from my computer so i have no idea how well the image viewing or mp3 playing works i also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections my house is fully wired with cat5 therefore i am using this product wired not wireless i was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton so far so good the first thing i did was check for updates an update was found and updated successfully i then had the dsm 320 look for media servers it found the tversity server right away and i was able to see the contents listed this unfortunately is the end of the good news it s all went downhill from here 1 neither server tversity or the dlink were smart enough to view a folder of vob files as a movie they listed them as vob 1 vob2 etc so for example i clicked on my casablanca folder i would then need to click on vob 1 to start the movie when vob 1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to vob 2 i needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play arrrgghh p o s thing 2 as another review stated the ff simply does not work properly oh sure if you press ff the movie will fast forward but there is no way to stop it if you press play while the movie is ff wding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current vob more arrrrgghh this alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device which i will be doing first thing in the morning my final advice to any prospective buyers s t a y a w a y my final advic to d link great idea but your product absolutely sucks oh one more thing someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly yes the two ladies i spoke to were both very friendly their english was terrible \( guess which county you call for tech support oh come on just one guess \) it also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another i could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients which made it very difficult for the lady helping me she needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over sheesh i must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right one last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention nero recode ce so i went to the nero site to check it out nero has a list of supported media players listed and you know what d link is not one of them i will return this d link junk and purchase one the nero certified product instead i bow my head in shame as i had read the reviews but i bought the product anyway	negative

when my cds started skipping i thought they has seen the last days of spinning however this disc cleaner has solved all problems you simply put the cd into the cleaner with the label side down then you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface you only apply one even spray of cleaner then you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times you can remove the disc and let it dry completely most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations i found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick the first time i used this cleaner i was a bit frustrated with it because i noticed little pieces of black foam all over my cds apparently there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down but once i removed that piece of foam all was go this unit comes with one additional cleaning pad i think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints you won t have to replace the cleaning pads very often handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces therebeccareview com	positive
we ve had this printer for almost two years i do a good amount of printing both color b w while i do need to do cleanings more often with this printer mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all and it is very affordable photos don t always print well the only photo paper i have found to work well with my s530d was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when i bought it no other photo paper has done well at all so i suggest theirs this is the best printer we have had in 10 years and belive me i ve thrown my share out the window i can offer this advice to owners of any printers always use the power switch on the printer to turn it on off never use the power strip switch or the switch from properties for some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink i don t get it but i ve always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us good luck jeanni	positive
the design for this headset is ingenious every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience it s not really a headset but a headphone with a detachable headset so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player the microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base the extension cord comes with a volume controller another very convenient feature there are also little hangers on the extension cord which are for attaching the microphone cord the audio quality is pretty good throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality the only thing i have to complain about is the comfort issue maybe it s the size of my head but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage other than that this headset is perfect	positive
radio reception in my apartment is terrible i have purchased a few indoor antennas even a different terk model but none of them helped very much i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel this unit however works great i get every station i want and the digital fm works great the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky so if you re concerned about asthetics you ll have to figure out where you can conceal it also i didn t get any additional benefit from the amplifier but the antenna worked so well that i didn t need it	positive

i bought this model in order to be rid of my almost new sony mhcec70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner having once owned an earlier pm series model this new panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint like its predecessor the pm53 is a nice powerful compact stereo with \( for the money \) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner especially on the fm band it can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses the remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual right now this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning sony s competing models are cheesy looking \( hog attention on store shelves \) bigger \( i e take more materials cost more to ship \) and consequently suffer certain cost cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified \( and of course proprietary \) antenna connector it s like choosing between the pontiac and the toyota the sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar coated bling the panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture	positive

this particular cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it it will blow you away i ve heard people complain about dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support autually their tech support sucks but i don t need them this is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully when you actually learn how to use it you won t buy anything else for the price if you are tech savey you will really enjoy the product i have nine cams installed at three locations using their ip software you can view upto 16 at once the reason i m back on this site is because i need to order two more i did have to return my first one but it was a pre production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear dlink sent my replacement direct the oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now one last comment the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50 more with less features	positive

great product that works exactly as described i have not used this as a stand alone label maker i ve only used it with my computer the software is fairly easy to use and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet which is a definite plus i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey i spent 40 on the label maker and so far i ve spent 60 on tape	positive

this one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on that turns out to make life so much easier it has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work and go through security to get into work all without having to open my bag the remote has a velcro strap that i use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack i am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out my only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap as the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected because when things do come undone you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click	positive

cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear cups but after a few months light use i lost sound through one cup then the other in general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on the batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery i had in there lasted longer than the unit itself very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected	negative

i m using this in an area where as usual there is no map data for the trails and roads navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain to known trails i ve been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when i should have my chin up navigating even then the functionality is very limited seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool but so far it s only a novelty item in order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded i will need to purchase the 100 mapsend software which contains no useful data for me only provides the functionality of editing creating my own base map a function i can only do on my laptop something i usually don t carry out into the wilderness basically i bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges passes peaks and unknown road systems while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress so far it s a 0 5 points in this department if you want to find your way back to points this is useful however for other types of navigation involving linear objects such as trails and roads waterways the software isn t there yet	negative

the belkin tunetalk is fabuous for using an ipod as a digital recorder i have had very good results recording various music rehearsals \( children s choir to big band \) with and without an external powered microphone \( sony ecm ms908c stereo mic \) attached since i already had the mic the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a zoom digital recorder for this type of recording i haven t plugged it into a mixing board yet i suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a mackie 1202 or better i bought a usb power adaptor so i wouldn t have to worry about battery drain it plugs into the tunetalk and provides power to the ipod no it isn t as good as a high dollar recorder dedicated mic pre s and a pair of neumann mics serious recording requires serious equipment however for all those other recordings the tunetalk stereo is a great recording option for about 60 and your trusty ipod	positive

extremely disappointed especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product \( and the axion 7 player \) received i bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv the player worked fine for the first dvd we tried but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black you couldn t see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine no complaints about the sound i guess but what good is that if the screen doesn t work needless to say i returned this as fast as possible in fact if i could rate it less than one star i would since it didn t even last one day terrible product	negative

besides the fact that ipod is a skinny little waste of time let s also mock the fact that it plays about two formats whatever mac plays and mp3 woohoo what a selection then we have the iaudio it has perhaps a half inch thickness at most over the ipod for the standard battery model \( 20gb and 30gb anyway 60gb is as thick as an xl \) though it includes so much more bang for your buck even if some of that bang is kind of useless but come on an fm radio isn t ipod standard almost every other portable hd player has that by now about the only thing ipod has over iaudio is movie quality which is admittedly better but i m fairly basic i m buying it for my music not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen if i want to do that i ll buy a portable dvd player for pictures unless they re ridiculously high quality this suits just fine but it s not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players it s the sound quality which is marvelous it consistantly beats ipod it has bbe equalizer and it not plays mp3 and aac but wma wav ooc and flac flac and if you download rockbox \( which is something you ll have to research on your own kids \) you can create themes boost your battery life and augment your listening pleasure even further the only drawbacks are the battery life if you don t use playlists skip around a lot or play high bitrate files \( all of which are fixed rather well by rockbox \) and the subpack what is a subpack it s a fairly good idea done badly it s a piece of plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player in it are the power jack line out \( which has a bad bass roll off problem unfortunately \) and line in jack and usb port the general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else but it wasn t executed too well buying a charger from com solves the power jack and usb port problems nicely and is recommended most highly \( and did i mention recording with the built in mic is amazing you can get good quality concerts with this puppy \) plus it s black ipod comes standard white and the x5 is just better	positive

i recently bought this thinking i could use it to upgrade my ti 86 calculator to my surprise i heard it was incompatible with xp i supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn t work as soon as i recieved the cable it said to go to the website so i went and updated the software specific to my calculator after the installation it asked me to restart after the restart i immediatly recieved a blue screen of death and luckily windows xp found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that i would have to do a format i have not fully installed it yet as now i have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100 xp compatible and may mess up your system	negative
don t believe the claim that you can just plug it in and it s ready to use this product is set up for windows and the instructions for installing the drive for a mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the windows software it s easy to become hopelessly fouled up don t expect any help from western digital if you can actually get connected to them and your call isn t dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so you ll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive their web site help is equally useless	negative
this card using via s superb envy24 ht chipset is a huge improvement over my realtek and via envy24ht s based cards everything sounds better my old audigy 2 platinum \( which i think i shall melt \) did better in 3d games but only slightly since this card doesn t snap crackle and pop like the creative cards do i ll venture to say that it actually does make games better since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game pros very high audio sampling rates allowing for incredibly good audio production warm rich warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs no crackling popping or hissing a real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why creative labs cards keep doing this well maintained solid drivers supports eax 2 0 excellent asio support cons no hardware support for directsound however if your machine is faster than about 1ghz you probably won t notice the difference benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you ll find that no hardware directsound acceleration amounts to less than a 1 difference in speed only supports up to eax 2 0 due to creative labs refusing to license the technology sound difference is minimal though	positive

so i bought this a couple months ago at first i was in love great sound quality and the surround sound aspect works well in fps games also very comfortable much more so than any other 5 1 headphones i have owned the initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly though first of all the microphone sucks i ve seen better microphones on 20 radio shack headphones these are gaming headphones and expensive ones at that you would think the microphone would be at least passable it isn t secondly the build quality is pretty bad within a few weeks the control brick started giving me problems the sound would go off on one side or the other a bit annoying this only happens sporadically and can be fixed by squeezing the sound controller not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement but annoying nonetheless i ve also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws screws that aren t properly inserted and they have a tendency that fall out now i have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone and i can t find the tiny screw so i ll have to either try and repair it myself which means trying to find somewhere i can buy tiny rare screws or have to send it in for repair i might as well send it in for repair because maybe they could also fix the volume controller really kind of disappointing for supposedly premium gaming headphones the microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or ts and the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price i bought some 5 1 headphones for 40 a few years back they only lasted a year but they had none of the issues that the razer has kind of sad that a cheap chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap	negative
i love my tooldial and its software my only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively i frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in design a little overall great product and i expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs works very well in tandem with a wacom tablet	positive

this is a terrible product if you can get it to print the labels look great but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that i can find i get an error that it didn t print but no reason why i ve installed on two different pcs one is brand new and same thing happens software is also pretty useless it also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive the online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond	negative

according to other reviews this radio compares favorably with others in its price class as a ham radio operator i can say i am very happy with the e5 it is the best portable broadcast band radio i have ever had it is the best portable shortwave radio i have ever had i was particularly interested in ssb capability it works well i called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement i use 2100 mah nimh batteries which i charge externally i have two sets the radio works well with these i found that the internal antenna by itself indoors is not enough i used the included wire antenna with moderately good results but more convient is using the telescoping antenna this antenna works according to the manual for fm and sw only but i found that extending it fully is effective in all cases ressults using this method were similar to the wire holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver there are limits to what is possible in a package this size i have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna for what it is this is a great tool it is a convient size and easy to program and use it more than meets my expectations	positive

purchased this tv december 10 after much research unfortunately for me the tv was defective on arrival when it is working it is a very nice tv but the customer support from both olevia and target leave a lot to be desired target will not replace the item the corporate policy i am told is the item must be returned via shipping you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up and once target receives the tv back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued they say within 30 days my credit card company ae says it will take 6 12 weeks all this time with no tv paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears i don t know about you but that is pretty steep now olevia though it is under warranty i again must pack up the tv in the original box ship it back to olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me the tv weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again i am without tv for a month or more while the transaction takes place if i want a tv at the time the defective one is shipped i must give olevia a 1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction either way the consumer gets screwed the television has a one year warranty i purchased the extended warranty what else could i have done i am told by both target and olevia this policy falls under the other terms and conditions i wonder why they don t actually say that buyer beware of target and olevia	negative

my company purchased two of these phone a month or two back for office use previously we had an at t which i ll probably never own again after having a panasonic the phones have great voice quality plus some nice features you don t always find like the hold option data port on the back and a nice lcd screen displaying date time missed calls messages and in call timer i do wish however that the lcd was backlit another great feature is the fact that it displays the associated caller id stamp with the message that is playing no more guessing who left the message when the phones have been standing up beyond our expectations and i plan on buying panasonic phones our next time around	positive
it didn t match the acoustic wave player i bought there should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces the page from which i ordered both pieces was unclear and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player \( i know i ll be refunded the price of the first changer \) but by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished i received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers i think amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss	negative
the battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only i am very disappointed in the quality we need them for emergencies throughout the day this is a farmed animal sanctuary non profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already i am willing to change my review if we get new batteries they came on time they are good quality other than the batterie	negative

i use my lx4 2 1 system as my desktop pc speakers i got this recommendation from maximum pc since the lx4 5 1 system was 2005 s best speaker system you can view their gear of the year review here http www maximumpc com 2005 12 m audio studiop 1 html being skeptical of a 550 5 1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite i wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2 1 system as soon as i purchased cables \( fyi no 1 8 stereo to two 1 4 mono cables seem to exists as far as i ve seen so you have to use adaptors \) i was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers i wasn t used to speakers with crossovers where only the each type of speaker \( tweeter woofer and sub \) gets the right frequencies so no overlapping exists all the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality after only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound intensive games i immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5 1 expander setup if you are looking for speakers that play really loud or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie these are not for you but if you want incredibly accurate pc speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you you will not be disappointed if you buy the lx4 for your bedroom or for computer use	positive

i ve been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming pc and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool i had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until i bought this after shuffling my pci cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 ultra i fired the machine up \( and closed the case \) and did some gaming all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card this fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5 7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore once the chaos on the screen starts to subside the cooling is even better as an added bonus this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game i thought for sure that i would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and i was surprised to find that i had to listen for it in order to hear it about the only complaint i have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back \( which i knew when i bought it \) so it is not temperature sensitive still deserves 5 stars though	positive
i bought this drive in late 2003 and it s gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then the positives first though it has an 8mb buffer it is very fast and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers it does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig wd s and the newer seagates 2 5 years after purchase the drive started corrupting files like crazy wd has tools on their site to check your disk status and sure enough it was due for an rma when i checked the warranty status online 6 months had mysteriously vanished from my warranty period the drive warranty had started 6 months before i d purchased it anyway it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick still this is my second wd drive to die and i m going with other brands from now	negative

overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren t necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set up these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again	positive

i enjoy this mouse usually i don t like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse i had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student i have small hands and i hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag since i have to lug my laptop around i needed a mouse that didn t take a lot of space is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop and that worked well with my needs pros small size optical scrolling tab and portability cons sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own but this happens only a few times every few weeks so it s not often enough to cause a problem for me enjoy	positive

the software to this mp3 player made it too much work anything that freezes up my computer has to go here s my experience i purchased this player on february 23rd and returned it to the store on march 8th i was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try i installed the software with no problem but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players i just didn t like the look of it or how it categorized the music files i did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine it had a very nice sound easy to use and wonderful to carry around i listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge fast foward week 2 i wanted to delete some files and add some new ones i opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as i did at first first the program began running really slow and then froze i ctr alt delete and started over it worked for a second and then froze again i rebooted and it did the same thing i came back to it the next day and it did it again i uninstalled it \( so i thought \) and it continued to freeze it doesn t completely uninstall off of your computer i know this because i didn t have to re authorize my computer to use it again i had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer there are lots of hidden files in conclusion had it not been for my experience with the software i would have kept the player	negative
just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they ve lasted me this long for light office use so at 7 year this seems to be a good budget earphones i m not an audiophile so i don t need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story don t twist or touch the wires cable pros lightweight budget oriented comfortable fit for my ears cons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil	positive

claiming that this fan s 3 speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling is very misleading on low the fan barely moves any air on high it still doesn t move much air and is incredibly quiet nearing silent in my opinion if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads this is not the fan for you the 3 speed switch is useless as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high	negative

upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer the digital camera still works great the printer is another matter while this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes as we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink replacing every cartridge at once will run you about 75 at a time give or take a few the gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first 50 70 pictures after that the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register very frustrating when you re printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to in the long run i will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing quality wise it gets you in the beginning but doesn t hold out for the long run we have fiddled with it for two years enough s enough	negative

the very first dvd player i bought was sony s very first 5 disc dvd changer back in 1998 it was an excellent player but as the technology improved it could no longer keep up i upgraded to a single disc sony which could handle dts and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video but i always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start at about one third the price of that original dvd changer this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player it produces an excellent picture has lots of tweakable settings has more outputs and is also very stylish looking i do have a couple of nits though my original dvd changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc i wanted with this one i have to press a disc skip button to cycle through all the discs until i reach the one i want the front of the player does have direct access buttons though i wish i still had my old remote control as i m sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality second the upscaling through hdmi produces a great image but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p in fact upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture it s also unfortunate that while connected through hdmi progressive scan cannot be turned off this shouldn t be an issue most of the time but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote but they cannot be turned off when connected through hdmi one last thing about the hdmi connection there can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using hdmi connections and digital tvs this is not a problem with the player but with the way hdmi is currently implemented this player has an audio sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem however the audio sync adjustment doesn t work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs since i need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5 1 sound the audio sync adjustment feature is useless here and that s a shame by the way there should be no audio sync issues if the player is connected via component s video or composite outputs there s also a minor thing i ve found about all my sony dvd players that i haven t liked they are unable to correctly display time remaining on certain discs or more commonly on the special features \( documentaries etc \) on certain discs i also have a cheapo philips player which has no problems displaying time remaining on those things \( even on the menu \) it s an improvement i d really like to see implemented on future players now despite the complaints i ve listed above don t get me wrong this is still an excellent player and i really love it i happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it it really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances and i feel it s the best dvd player i ve ever owned it s just not quite perfect in all likelihood it s also the last dvd player i ll ever own as i ll probably be buying a bluray or other hd player in a couple of years when that format war is over but this is a great player to hold me over until then	positive

i bought this router hoping that some of the quality in cisco s excellent enterprise market routers would have worn off on adopted child linksys unfortunately my experience has me convinced that linksys is a red headed stepchild \( my apologies to all you red heads \) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent that being said the router does work out of the box and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home network routers my perusals of the dsl reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub 300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies and this one is certainly no exception pros this router is configured to work right out of the box you can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen the html based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use you don t have to learn one single command line to configure this router default configuration was stealth mode meaning the router did not respond to any unsolicited connection requests forming a protective black hole on my ip for most uninvited packets cons not all of the features worked out of the box several of the links in the html command pages simply did not link to anything strange that linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don t point to anything turning on the poorly documented firewall feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests sometimes the router responds port closed to all requests sometimes it responds port closed to some and port open to others \( the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next \) never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration \( with firewall inactive \) i m not sure how the firewall in this router is configured to behave but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature the router s dhcp functionality works great when it works it mysteriously disengages at random intervals requiring a reboot \( and sometimes a flash to factory defaults \) to remedy flashing a new bios image is risky router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer or file13 if the warranty is out for what it s worth i am still using this router it serves its basic purpose and while its functionality issues are annoying there are workarounds for all of them i probably will not buy another linksys but the problems with this one aren t annoying enough to warrant a return sean hennin	negative

when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder it worked fine but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development i heard they were more powerful and more versatile so i bought one i was not disappointed since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car it fit perfectly on my keychain also it has a much longer range than the others but best of all it is directional meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases what a great product i love it	positive

had to give it one star because there is nothing lower this printer was the answer to my printing dreams for about three months with light home use only fault at that time is it is loud it will wake the dead which is ok since the dead don t have to print things that often this is the perfect printer for them other than noise a faulty load paper error kept coming up then the paper load went bad it is very unreliable and ink cartridges run out very quickly and cost about 10 bucks a pop tonight i m trashing it buying another printer tonight do not waste your money on this piece of trash	negative

ok i got this as gift so i got nothing to lose right well this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle ever since i unpacked this little thing it has been with me everywhere on the go exercise sleeping anywhere you have pockets to put it ipod shuffle is always with me whenever i needed some kick of tunes its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 gb of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me lol sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer update tunes on the go so if you are a fast paced mobile and not a control freak then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it	positive

i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability there s nothing convenient about its need for 2 usb slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging if you re reading the requirements for mac os x you miss the bullet point in the win xp section calling out the need for 2 free ports amazon s description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing two usb ports boooo seagate i m offended that you re offering such clumsy connectivity	negative
bought these to use with the xm myfi they are not comfortable to use they put pressure on your ears now the good news they do get decent reception i tried them in my office in nyc which has a northern exposure and it got good reception	negative
i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding compact headphone for work and working out at the gym if you are like me and can t stand all the earbuds out there then you need to find another solution i tried the premium zune buds at 40 bucks and the bose quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under 40 headphone out there that won t mess with your hair \( yes better than even the bose earbuds \) if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player be prepared to be blown away tight full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids you don t have to crank them either they sound rich even at lower volumes but if you do crank them they don t distort at all if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores these sound very similar but with an open air design the only negative is the comfort the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so i think i ll get used to it i d much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal \( which i had \) that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems some other reviewers complained about the headband but it sounds like they were not wearing these right once on your noggin the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort i do not think the headband is too tight it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place i might buy a pair of the px 100 s as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading the px 100 is the same exact phone in an over the head design at 40 i can afford to get both	positive
there is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper the cartridges are not full i just got off the phone with hp tech support and they confirmed this the cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as custom cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4x6 photos in fact the tech support rep discribed the custom cartridges as having way less than standard cartridges less than 50 full on a related note i asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my new printer were full and he said they should have been full standard cartridges so this value pack isn t such a great value now is it	negative

this unit is not compatible with the sprint ppc 6700 as posted above make sure you call pioneer with your telephone model number for compatibility i tried the ppc 6700 and my wife s phone \( another sprint phone not sure on the model number \) both have issue and pioneer s customer service agent was horrible and would not help solve this issue only to blame me for not calling pioneer first this unit is the first device that was not compatible with my phone that i ran into	negative
although i prefer the akg k701 for most of my listening this competing entry from beyer is so close that it s almost a coin toss \( one recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat \) this is surprising considering that the dt880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid priced headphones the bass is full but nicely textured not a touch of bass bloat to be found here the highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage instead of the music being on top of your these beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way these headphones don t require a headphone amp but certainly profit from one the 30 ohm version makes for more volume though the 250 ohm version is standard and best for most daily listening the dt880 sounds great but lacks a tad of the k701 s high end sparkle conversely beyer s value comfort and workmanship can t help but impress this is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the akgs and the senn 650s but listeners are always impressed by the dt880s sound it may be your best value in a mid priced all purpose headphone	positive
quick reader poor design it does a great job copying images to my mac but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo poo it stays on tight which is good until you try to open it the force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball groove hinges useless it s only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off leaving the reader exposed to the elements	positive

i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago so far so good it interfaces very easily with the computer though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit \( if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs \) it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos the only negative that i have so far is that the volume at its highlest level is difficult to hear on an airplane you may need some noise canceling headphones	positive

still embarking on spooling off all the hi 8 tapes i have but i ve been very satisfied with the plextor unit so far first thing i did was to spool one hi 8 tape and then make a dvd using the functionality of the bundled windvd creator software good news it worked and a few hours after i started i was watching the dvd i created on my bedroom dvd player bad news the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances it may be that i m still climbing the learning curve with it but i think it s just not very good i m looking into other solutions such as pinnacle adobe premiere elements etc meanwhile i keep spooling i haven t yet tried the tv capture in any depth it looked like it worked but again with some annoyances on the software side plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software	positive

the only thing i will say about the bdp s1 is that it is top quality picture and sound quality are top notch but everything really depends on the software now if you are undecided about which camp to follow \( blu ray or hd dvd \) i m here to tell you that blu ray will win you see i have both blu ray and hd dvd i have about 20 hd dvd movies and about 20 blu ray movies in terms of picture and sound quality they are the same but it is completely dependant on the software but here is where the similarities end 1 \) blu ray is more durable the bd movie discs have scratch resistant coating they don t scratch unless you forcefully scratch them on the other hand the hddvd movies scratch like heck i put all of my movies in a cd case i recently noticed that all the hddvd movies are scratched but none of the blu ray movies are scratched these are stored in the same cd case by me i am extremely careful none of my movies even have a fingerprint on them so when i see scratches on 100 of my hddvd movies that really upsets me 2 \) blu ray costs less to buy what superman returns bd is 24 superman hddvd is 28 the departed bd is 24 the departed hddvd is 28 now the hddvd dual format has both a standard dvd and hddvd movie but who in their right mind would want to buy an hddvd to watch a 480p picture right now you can get a 500 ps3 or 400 toshiba hddvd player later this year sony will come out with a 300 blu ray disc player hddvd will most likely drop their prices so the hardware will cost the same in both formats 3 \) blu ray has more capacity for less money you can get a 50gb blu ray movie versus a 30gb hddvd movie and what if in 5 years they develope super high definition 1920p picture and super hi def 8 1 dts hd sound what if this requires 75gb or 100gb hddvd can go up to 51gb peace	positive
the reviewer below identifying himself as an electronics fan obviously has a deep bias against bose his multiple reviews about bose products here and elsewhere are transparently motivated by some animus against bose was he fired by bose did a member of the bose family reject his romantic advances did a bose executive accidentally run over his cat did he drop a bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe the true motivation for this guy s negative reviews would be fun to know in the meantime what we do know is that he has no credibility and his reviews \( two here others elsewhere for other bose products he s made maligning bose his life s work apparently \) \) should disregarded i bought a set of black 301 s several years ago to go with my onkyo receiver we have it hooked up to a television and dvd player for movies these speakers are in constant use both for the dvd and for music of all types the room in which they are placed is huge with an 18 foot high flat ceiling the speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day the speakers work fine for spoken audio for dvd s we can hear dialogue perfectly i feel no particular need for a surround sound system several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto i feared a ruptured speaker cone but the 301 s are very forgiving no damage has been done the cats sleep on the speakers they clean right up and still look new after five years these speakers keep on giving total satisfaction and i quite simply love them about three years ago i decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market or at least what i determined to be best after a lot of research this included a set of the gold series tower speakers from monitor audio \( the speaker cones are metallic with some amount of gold and gold connections etc etc \) these monitor audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made \( real wood veneer cabinetry with the gold cones and the black covers etc \) these speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each well i must confess as awesome as the monitor audios sound i can t really say they sound any better than the bose 301 s they can maybe handle more power but i assure you the bose 301 s will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less so when i recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom i looked forward to buying a third type of speakers i ran around and listened to what i could find on display well after much contemplation i went for a second set of the bose 301 s they just couldn t be beat and i would have gladly spent more if i had found something i liked better but i m not going to spend more just so i can say i spent a lot there has to be increased performance and in my opinion the 301 s couldn t be out performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range my first set of 301 s were black this time i went for the cherry folks these are absolutely beautiful speakers almost as cool looking as my monitor audios the black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood no it is not real wood but it looks very nice these things are simply gorgeous the kind of mod or futuristic shape which bose has designed really stands out in this lighter colored version and yes they sound just as good as my original pair i listen to soft music \( jazz typically or ambient \) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume i listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions and the 301 s don t scare away or distort at all these things would tear the house apart before they d lose sound quality so yes i recommend these highly they d still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price	positive

i purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly humid house i live in california but my house is naturally very humid \( around 75 on average \) the humidity frequently gets up to around 80 and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer mold was fast becoming a problem i have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now and it is scary how well it works i placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it s highest and it lowered my 15 x15 room from 75 to 50 in less than three hours it has a quiet fan that i have no problem sleeping with the tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room i have not owned any other dehumidifiers before so i have no basis of comparison but i am in love with this one it was completely worth the price	positive

i purchased this product to replace a really good 802 11g unit from linksys hoping to set up a gigabit home network with ethernet storage i initially considered the wrt300n model but the reviews were mediocre so i went instead for this newer model hoping that linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the wrt300n model i am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the wrt300n also apply to this model i am returning it after 5 hours of use on my home network set up with my current linksys 802 11g unit i am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house and all four movies display flawlessly on this new unit optimized for streaming video i was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit the movie had interruptions every 4 5 seconds this was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with g cards and n cards and performance degraded as i tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time the speed of the links to my laptops equiped with n cards was 144 mb s and was 54 mb s on those equiped with g cards so the connection seemed fast enough it might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way it might be able to perform as i expect but i don t have time to waste on such tweaking and given that my 802 11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box there is no point to upgrade to this new flawed model i ll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out	negative

the product works well for my space and needs one note to amaazon when you ship a 400 item thats semi fragile and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball how does the consumer deal with physical damage the item is so massive to ship back and most likey costly i experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right i was worried how the shipping would be handled and sure enough i was worried rightfully the dvd tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out the top of the receiver dvd player had been slightly caved in even with all the packing samsung supplied it could not protect the product from the shipping company it will be such a hassle to try and exchange this that i am not sure if i will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again other than that i have purchased smaller items and less fragile from amazon with no issues i realize that the shipping damage canot be held on amazon as it is out of their control i just don t think i will roll the dice on something like this in the future too bad it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen	positive

a terrific idea show the current time and the alarm times all at once very intuitive very helpful unfortunately the backlit lcd display just doesn t make the grade the numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable the manufacturer s photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic the numbers just wash out it s interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer s image and from the unit i got i think that would be a slight improvement because on the one i got the orange \( backlighting the alarm times \) is about twice as bright as the green \( backlighting the current time \) and it just looks weird also fm radio reception is quite poor the line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna but that just doesn t work well no matter how i orient the cord i can t tune in a strong station just 10 miles away so back it goes	negative

everything about the sonos worked as advertised it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated the interface is commonsense and well thought out it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously you can also play different music all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises	positive

what an amazing product for such a small price it works right out of the box but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers the option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday pc work as well using the pen for graphics i use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures it really makes a difference the unit seems well made and i like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice i opted for the smallest in the range for value and was not disappointed but i am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better but at cost the software bundle is ok too if you don t already have photoshop tools the one quibble is that at home when i installed the drivers it continued to crash my pc with my wireless keyboard installed not ideal but as i dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me but be careful i am sure there will be a fix somewher	positive

in spite of some of the poor reviews for this product it met all of my expectations 100 thanks to the reviews i understood that the unit doesn t have a builtin antenna or batteries which was helpful to know in advance but of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place i was looking for a small tv to fit in the corner of my bathroom and this unit is perfect for that as a bonus i can not only watch the news while i m getting ready for work in the morning but i can listen to mp3 rips when i m in the shower i ve owned the unit for several weeks now use it every day and have never had a problem playing any disk either copy protected movies or cds my only concern so far has been that i didn t receive a warrantee card with the unit i especially like the portability it s so easy to pick up and take anywhere such as watching a movie in bed and even outside \( if it s not too bright out \) for watching sports on the patio the speakers are adequate considering their size and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if i want better quality in summary i have to repeat that my expectations were set before i bought the unit and i am very pleased with what i got for the price	positive

what were they thinking or are they thinking at all sonic stage is a piece of crap it freezes hangs and very very user friendly since you need their software to load the music i would stay away from this player as far away as possible pros nice sound quality cons everything else my recommendation is go for creative usb players it s very good quality and better battary life with creative players you just drag and drop files and you done with it i see why sony is failing in mp3 players market	negative
the good we plugged in our new lns2651d on 3 7 7 about an hour northwest of tampa bay right out of the box with an old rabbit ear antenna we received five hd broadcasts the picture is amazing in both color and clarity the bad we reset the sound coming directly from its speakers but because of speaker location underneath below the screen it lacks sparkle esp at low to med volume the ugly imagine sending your intelligent pretty young daughter out on her first date with shoveled on make up and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress the piano black case on this tv is a nightmare it shows a rippled effect which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines \( even lightly \) on it i m hoping after the r d department who designed the case is sent to siberia they redeem themselves by designing a matte finish slip cover for this otherwise excellent tv	positive
i purchased one \( from a local store not amazon com \) brought it home and printed a photograph that i had previously printed on a kodak easyshare printer \( my mother in law s \) the resulting photograp was horrible it had a very green tint to it i then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained i checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checked cleaned the print heads and still the problem remained given that the product is still on the market i suspect i had a broken unit i did not like the lcd it is very hard to read i adjusted the contrast but it did not help	negative

this is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their mac a lot of mileage i m in law school so i m constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks keys and other junk my old ibook survived tremendous abuse and after two years looked like it had been through a war the speck case protects the macbook s shell and even the screen in a roundabout way normally if you put a mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books the books will press against the shell and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the lcd the speck case is very stiff so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don t push the screen onto the keyboard plus if you put a red case on a white mac people will think you re in some secret club that has access to red macs cons it s next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands you need a buddy to get it off also dust starts to collect under the bottom case \( static \) so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning	positive
i ve had mine for 10 months now and it s been very reliable not one problem with it it s quick to print out the first page the display is a monochrome lcd with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces \( say if you keep it under a counter \) no paper jams no nonsense also if you re an apple owner the drivers are already included with os x truly plug n print what s a real treat is to combine it with an apple airport express and use apple s bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer bonjour is available for both os x and windows computers and is a breeze to install i highly recommend if you re in the market for a multifuntion monochrome laser printer machine that is compatible with both windows and mac os	positive
the product description in january 2007 is inaccurate batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours not 60 there is no hands free speakerphone if you use a standard plug in headset the microphone does not work \( tested two units \) there is more the headset is very loud \( you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear \) but there is no volume adjustment the microphone has low sensitivity so you find yourself yelling into it the clock resets itself when the power is turned off i returned mine	negative
being a graduate student and living in an apartment i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments it prints off things quite well and it is fast it does not however print 500 pages per month 50 100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition	negative
i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don t buy it here just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by 9 00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i m glad i did just don t buy the disks from amazon	negative
this card is great for the seamless apple look and feel \( and only option for internal in imac ibook pb \) but it is way overpriced now that it is out of production there are other options belkin f5d6050 usb b adapter has drivers for 9 2 and osx several manufacturers \( e g certain belkin linksys microsoft \) pci cards have airport extreme chipsets \( broadcom \) on them that osx reads as a real airport xtreme card you need to do your research and some cards have different chipsets in different revisions but it is pretty easy overall and you can save 100	positive

i exchange audio letters with friends and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available the sound quality is perfectly fine though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high end machine it comes with a stereo microphone but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit as it is there is a long clip on cord this makes it tough to do off the cuff recording overall a good value for the money the other machine cost nearly 300	positive

this review pertains specifically to the targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2 0 hub the cord is about 2 5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy duty hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible inconvenient to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk	positive

simply put the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely there are always bubbles if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard so when you close the lid the material then transfers some of that dirt right back my resolve just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft clean semi wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster	negative

stylish comfortable good sound quality and utterly useless at noise cancelation great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes and you ll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight perhaps there s a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box i suggest you insist on this sure turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise but as far as i can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume	negative
i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price \( i ve had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past \) these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands not surprisingly the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor 716a drive i haven t tested a whole lot yet but the ones i did test burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run there were no errors you really can t go wrong with verbatim just buy them	positive

i would give this 5 stars but for a few things the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during exercise syncing is sometimes buggy you have to load all podcasts manually podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player no matter how you arrange them in itunes recent releases of itunes have solved some but not all of the sync issues also i have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem but they involve rebuilding your library and furthermore from what i ve read they re just temporary fixes apple needs to fix this still the small form factor cool design and easy to use controls make this a great product i sold my 4g 40gb ipod right after i got this and i have no regrets	positive

this card is the 2 gb ultimate 120x it has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb sec which exceeds 18 mb per second frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed which is always much faster analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second that impacts time between pictures for cameras write speed is the most important but the speed rating of the card doesn t necessarily tell you its write speed for music players and other devices read speed may be more important so you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures i m currently shopping for sd cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes in order not to slow the camera down i need a fast card i have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren t necessarily even related to this particular card but are for all different sizes and speeds of kingston cards kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings this card is 1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed	positive

i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you can t save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you ll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me 50 dollars and it can do the same thing for yo	negative
the klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long i researched dockable ipod mp3 players for a few months before i decided on this one for my wife s office i m fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment the i grove does not disappoint it provides room filling sound with no distorion i listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality i insist on it delivered another bonus with the klipsch is it s ability to accomodate other mp3 players and or personal compact disc players i m completely satisfied with my purchase of the klipsch i groove	positive

this is our first lcd tv our tube tv finally died my wife actually picked out this unit and consumer reports also recommended this unit we purchased it directly from amazon on january 23 2007 i wanted to wait a couple of months before i write my review to see if anything happens but to my surprise the tv is still running and there have been no problems we have digital hd and the pictures are great it took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast however if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat but overall its a good buy for us	positive
not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it s now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand	negative

i bought my wife a nuvi 350 for her birthday last august \( overall we love the nuvi but the mount no \) the biggest advantage of the nuvi over other gps systems is its portability unfortunately the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature the cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well and then won t let go when we tried to transfer it \( after being attached only a couple of days \) it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield \( though with difficulty and repeated tries we have been able to move it \) what this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in the mount and the charging power wire \( which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount \) are pretty darn expensive \( 60 70 \) which is ridiculous for a portable system	negative

i love the feel of this gamepad after trying several others this is the best the wireless works ok i was 20 feet away and it was working the batteries are what needs improving according to many posts i thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside with a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing i also found new batteris at interstate battery store 1 dollar each the analog sticks could be a little tighter but i like the d pad wireless is great	positive
this product is not worth the money or trouble i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up save your money and don t buy this this would actually qualify for a zero star rating	negative

in short why a 1 star rating you wonder took forever to set up properly long wait time and poor help from tech support automatic set up i doubt will ever work for anyone though it does work once finally set up so i decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop new wireless router and a wireless print server \( ps \) so i can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house i did a lot of research and decided to get a belkin router \( f5d7231 4 \) and this ps from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set up easily together this is definitely not the case first be warned this product is not wpa compatible thus even though the router is wpa able you cannot use wpa with the ps and thus have to use wep for the network once this product is used hopefully in the future this product will support wpa but it would only hopefully do so thru a firmware upgrade do not think this ps is wpa compatible next be warned the box says 3 minute easy install well it took me about 12 hours total to get the ps working now wirelessly i am not a computer techie but i am smart a great problem solver and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages i tried to set up the ps on a static ip address as recommended by my techie friends but this just did not happen thus next time i restart the router it may assign the ps a different ip address and then i ll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set up for that new address so i plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue the crux of how i got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the mac addresses of the ps and computers in the network this is the golden key i searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router s and ps s web interfaces only this way was i able to unhook the land line from the ps to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly belkin tech support had medium wait time friendly techs \( not always speaking english without thick accents though \) and they were unable to solve my golden key for me they even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened so yes the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that i had to learn way more about this whole network configuration issue than i ever wanted or expected to and i had to manually configure the whole set up to get this product to work	negative
i purchased this to replace my 10 year old bel 846i and was really disappointed it is difficult to tell in the picture but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver on its own i wouldn t particularly like the color scheme but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield i can t believe they d think this was a good idea for some reason i was getting false laser alerts like crazy empty subdivisions on the expressway without a police car in sight parking lots at first i thought my phone might be interfering with the detector but i was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off i d expect this with a cobra detector that cost half as much but this is pretty terrible based on other reviews i don t think this is isolated to a defective unit	negative
this printer has been a piece of garbage since the day i bought it i don t know why i kept trying as the purchase was made about a year ago it should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and i would have cut my losses \( instead i did buy one more package of paper and ink mistake \) i have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge \( and i have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge i have printed about 6 \) the ironic thing is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful the one that i printed today was perfect but several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours this is the last time i try to use the printer it is finally going in the trash	negative

why do i get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by kensington people the fact is this light has some unique features that most usb lights don t including an on off switch and two brightness levels however that doesn t come close to overcoming the drawbacks first of all the price is way too high for what you are getting also the brightness difference between four and eight leds is negligible but the biggest flaw in this light by far is that the flexible arm is not nearly strong enough to support the weight of the lamp i have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor which is just plain ridiculous for the price they are getting they should have produced a more durable product	negative

i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work	negative

the azden transmitter receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews as an aspiring video maker it was a product i should have bought a long time ago mine is the 9v powered model not the aa but it has proven well made light and easy to use there s something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit i find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise the din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information	positive
bought this mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas she loves it it is small and easy to use the headphones could be better though the process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast considering you cannot hear the music without headphones and the headphones that come with it are not very good it only gets a 4 out of 5	positive

i purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it the drive has a controller board error i contacted western digital for a replacement but they tell me that it is out of warranty apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it if it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from western digital with other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties i will never buy western digital again	negative

i liked this charger so much that i ended up ordering a second unit premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty i called lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what they sent me another charger without hussle the call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way they definetly stand by and back up their warranty no problems with the second unit and if i ever need another one i would still buy a lenmar the two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar ppro h batteries one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular nimh batteries it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80 level in less than 15 minutes and the other ppro h batteries in about 7 8 minutes i didn t notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the ppro h batteries but the ppro h kind are more durable this charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110 240 v and the first to use neotherm charging technology it s solid and heavy duty charger not like the cheap kind that are everywhere i went through lots of sony chargers but you know what they will never see my money again the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot i have been using the msc815 since october 2005 almost daily and never once i had an issue with it	positive

i researched tvs for a long time before i ended up buying this set it helped that costco offered a coupon for 300 off the price \( 1000 final price \) i thought i may not like the tv so i decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return however there is no way i am returning this tv it s awesome the picture is great and that is just with sd the strech feature makes the regular 4 3 picture fit the screen and not look distored i was worried about buying the 37 tv and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion but there is no need with this tv since sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion dvds look incredible on this tv as well what is even better is the built in hd tuner i was debating upgrading my cable to the hd package but i decide to spend 13 on rabbit ears from target oh my once i plugged in the indoor antenna and let the tv track for digital stations i was amazed the analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter but when i went up to the hd digital companion station i couldn t believe my eyes an incredible hd picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk indoors no less why would i upgrade my cable tv to the hd package when they can t offer the local stations in hd especially when they are free with a simple antenna i was told this was possible but quite frankly i was skeptical not anymore i am so glad i got the sharp that has the built in tuner i seriously considered just buying the hd ready tv monitor and upgrade through my cable provider boy am i glad that i didn t do that if you are in the market for a very nice tv that is easy to use and provides a great picture i would highly recommend this set	positive

i ordered this cable a few weeks ago although i must say that it does work fine the cable looks cheap \( in fact it is very thin \) and its length is less than 6 feet as you may agree length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that so for 20 \( including shipping \) i think it was not exactly a good deal	negative

this has been the best investment i ve made for quite some time after experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit hawaii last year and having my computer die i invested into this unit i read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken i thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so i m going to try it and see sure enough this unit came with no problems i plugged it in and let it charge over night i then added my computer and my monitor to it i ve seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and i m so thankful that it has saved my computer if anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers i fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge	positive

since we bought this to work with our mac we have had nothing but problems if asked to print one page of a document only it freaks out all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down have had long sessions with hp customer service on the phone and they haven t a clue if we could have been bothered we would have taken it back but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages \( at least we do recycle \) there are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash can never work out specifically what we just sigh and reset it will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon	negative
when i first got this camera i was satisfied it is complicated to use \( definitely not intuitive \) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want however it took pretty good pictures however soon after the warranty expired it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn t stop it from doing that we tried to contact fuji but have gotten no response my wife found that this is a common problem \( overeposure and lack of response from fuji \) which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell hopefully they have fixed the problem but i wouldn t bet my money on it this camera has given us more frustration than it is worth	negative

i bought this item since i always make a lot of notes from books and other papers and don t want to type it in manually anymore this scanner probably like any other model needs a little training to get it right over the paper but once done it really works and faster than typing i dont use the addressbook or options with your gsm but they are no doubt very handy i just scan in from papers and beam it to my laptop both infrared and the cable work the cable is especially great for using the scanner live on the screen the scanned text appears on the pc as you type the dictionary also comes in very handy it must be a very complex product but just like the ipod or zenxtra mp3 players they work so buy one and save some time excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes or studies or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e g	positive
i ve had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer the monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is one thing that stands out here above all the other remotes wireless control over lighting i replaced my dimmers and switches with the monster dimmers and switches and now i can control every light in my house monster really doesn t talk much about this feature but being able to hit all off at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer you can even map ligthing scenes to activities if you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time really cool good job monster	positive
i have two ni mh chargers and sony batteries won t charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own non standard charger that probably won t again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest don t waste your money or support sony s attempt to bring non standard products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough	negative
they don t collapse so they aren t the most easily portable as you sure aren t putting them in your pocket you also aren t listening to music in bed with them as mentioned in other reviews the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears i tend to collect lower end headphones and why not so i do have a unique perspective on them \( or so i say mostly to flatter myself \) these compared to other vertical designs are good the sound is better than most not quite as good as the sony h ear line but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks these p9 s are simple one piece and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear the volume adjustment makes them nice for tv and computer use also if you ever listen while using a splitter make sure the other person is wearing the cans \( or whatever more power consumptiony headphones \) so you can cut your volume my wife wears cans when watching tv so when i just must watch some witty sonic commercial i just plug myself in they aren t perfect i d like to also try the sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the sony folding ones they did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my rio carbon was broken \( only volume control on the thing \) for reference my everyday buds are sony ed21lps which i highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out and can be stored in a very small area heck i even use the stupid pouch that comes with them but yeah knowing the weaknesses of the p9 if you think you d like it then you ll love it	positive
and i was right i should have passed on this it was a pain to configure and then none of the settings would stick whenever i changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset that kind of defeats the point returning this item so i can get something decent the money saved is not worth it	negative
i have had this unit for just over a year beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out because of this design it is prone to misalign the cd which will either not load and the no disc warning will show or when it does play there is a significant vibration to try to remedy this i had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit alas i just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime it is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a sony by the way the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor	negative

i bought this headset from retailer \( offline \) and returned it the next day first off i have to make it clear that i had no problems with sound even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger \( they use 40mm drivers \) the sound quality of the headset was just fine however when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin the awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears \( and a bad seal on closed back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation \) also i have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough in fact i litterally couldn t wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red \( flush \) from discomfort mind you i also own a cheap pair of koss headphones i can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isn t good at all discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return if your ears are tough you should have no problem with this headset the sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you however if you re looking for comfort and good sound isolation you ll want to look elsewhere	negative
i love the sound quality and the way i am able to exercise and not notice that i have headphones on the headphones don t slide but i have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit overall well worth the money	positive

these buds are definitely a step up from the standard ipod buds they stay in your ears much more easily \( without the foam black covers which are easily lost \) the sound is at least marginally better and the overall construction seems to be better you can t do much better for the money however if you re willing to spend a little more the jlab jbuds are the way to go i own both the gumys and the jbuds and the gumys are my workout pair and i use the jbuds for everything else but if you re looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the ipod buds the gumys are the way to go	positive
this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \)	negative

issue solved i returned the harmony for a full refund all thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team after screwing up everything on christmas day \( it was a christmas present \) \) your support staff said level 2 would contact me within 24 hours after waiting 72 hours i called support again yesterday after waiting 30 minutes i finally got to speak with a real live agent who could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor s approval this was after providing the incident number that took another 15 minutes i then waited another 30 minutes \( total now 1 15 \) before i had to leave i tried again several hours later after being told level 2 was not available i hung up and immediately returned my harmony to thanks logitech keit	negative

this unit satisfies in its gps functionality but is problematic elsewhere when i decided to purchase a gps i decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone \( motorola razr v3 \) the bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect unfortunately the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes even though the 6000t would still show the unit and phone as connected customer service was no help it seems their script only includes the instructions download the latest software \( i already had \) and reset the unit \( didn t help \) second problem the unit started turning itself off randomly \( actually it went into sleep mode \) while driving down the road the customer service response you are correct download the latest software \( i already had \) and reset the unit \( didn t help \) i finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair \( at my expense of course \) i received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired their solution for the unit randomly going into sleep mode they turned off the power management so the unit would not go into sleep mode under any circumstance well i suppose that is a solution but a pretty crappy one since if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle the gps battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car i expected much better at this price point shoulda gone with garmin	negative

consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing \( as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp \) expect these to fail within 1 2 years expect to pay approx 400 to replace the color wheel and 200 to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1 2 years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx 150 250 depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another 1 2 years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait 15 minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for 18 months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time i have a 42 samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every 2 years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap	negative
great item picture great sound great connection choices great one problem being located about a foot away from an under cabinet radio the presence \( shut off \) of this tv produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio to eliminate this sound you must unplug this tv from the power source or optionally move it at least three feet away which in our case is not practical very curious	positive
i ve held off reviewing this item until i actually got some alerts and i got plenty of them over the weekend so here it is there seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set up so many that after having no problems setting it up myself i d worried i d done something wrong over the weekend a number of thunderstorms tornados rolled thorough my area using the s a m e alert system for my county i received a notification for each warning i purchased this radio specifically for the s a m e alert system living in central mississippi we get tornado warnings all spring i didn t want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me my one beef with the unit is the radio reception even the included external antenna it s spotty especially the weather radio reception i m not sure how far i am from the nearest weather radio transmitter but living in the suburbs of madison i can t be too far if you re in a rural area i d definitely look into getting an external antenna \( it has a port for a better external antenna than the telescoping antenna included \)	positive

i have to rate this product and this company as horrible i purchased the x2 in 12 2004 everything was fine in 6 2005 the lamp blew less than 300 hours on it i called the company they said sometimes it happens i questioned the projector they said i just needed a new lamp 300 00 later oh you can only get the lamps from them you can only get service on the x2 from them i get the new lamp it just blew again about 700 hours half of what the life should be additionally the fan died which may be why the lamp blew maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago \( when it was still under warranty but they wouldn t look at it \) no they say no the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place the projector was blown clean on a regular basis this projector was not mistreated or misused infocus says sometimes this happens they for 250 plus 30 00 shipping will fix the fan i also need to buy a new lamp another 300 the company keeps saying it is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc etc etc they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product i will get a new projector i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one my new projector will not will never be an infocus product they have failed to stand behind their product their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties don t buy infocus	negative

after reading several reviews of this product i was skeptical about buying this cable i wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my ps2 but i was not sure about paying the price for these when the sony cables are about half the cost of the monster cables the reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the ps2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the tv almost discouraged me from even buying this product i decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my ps2 i am very happy that i decided to buy these cables the cable connector fits perfectly into my ps2 better than the connector on my original sony cables even the connectors fit nicely onto my tv they are snug but not too tight i believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my tv because of the 8 cut turbine connector which fits better than a standard rca plug the video and audio from my ps2 is unbelievable my ps2 pushes the video signal to my 32 lcd hd tv at 480i with these cables with my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry now the graphics are crisp and clear and i only wish i would have bought these sooner the display from my ps2 and games fits nicely onto my tv in widescreen now too before the picture was not centered on my tv and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen i would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their ps2 over the stock sony cables there are other monster cable versions for the ps2 available so choose the one that is right for you but if you want something that is moderately priced don t need digital audio via fiber and the next best thing to hdmi than this is the cable for you i am going to get the monster component cables for my ps3 next so i will be able to hook it up when i don t have hdmi available for it to use one more thought be sure to change the video output on your ps2 from rgb to y cb pb cr pr in the system configuration before hooking up your ps2 with these cables or it may not work my tv told me the connection was not supported and i did not have video output until i changed the video output setting on my ps2	positive

i made the mistake to buy the kensington laser pointer before this one the kensington is a good one very well made but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control i to not know any cheaper model with mouse function i can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the kensington together with the very practical possibility to store the usb receiver inside the unit but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter my kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as return on some applications \( exporer on windows and opera on mac os for instance \) i do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that however the hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which i prefer it the wheel system of the hiro presenter is very practical compared with my kensington i found no difference in the quality of the laser both do their job perfectly the mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it my unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both mac an pc overall i am extremely satisfied on the minus side the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours the fn label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage a bit disappointing but after all nothing really important the unit also lacks programmable buttons but i do not know any presenter with this feature bottomline this presenter works well it is not expensive and the mouse control is a true must	positive

i just bought my first laptop computer and really really hated the touchpad i found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain i spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number i am very happy that i did too its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile definately well made im about 5 11 and have fairly big hands i find this mouse comfortable to use it looks pretty cool too the red panels on the side light up which is always good for night work all the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month i couldnt ask for better all round performance and for 20 you really cant go wrong it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse the only reason i dont give it five stars well this is technology although it is a awesome piece of kit there are always other things or features they could have added	positive

\( note to brian the wap54g can be configured as a bridge i have two of them in just such a configuration took me about 10 minutes to set them up \) major modes of operation are 1 wireless access point \( its default set up \) 2 wireless client \( connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the wap54g and you now have a wireless ethernet device \) 3 wireless repeater \( extend range of wireless coverage \) 4 wireless bridge \( connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them acts as one end of a virtual cable you need two to get the job done \) a pair of wireless bridges is just what i needed but hesitated to buy the wap54g because of brian s comment that this wouldn t work because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that brian was wrong i bought a pair and they do work i rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons 1 i understand that higher end more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment 2 one must dig very deeply into the users guide \( a pdf on the cd \) to find the default ip address in order to configure this device luckily i had read elsewhere what that ip address is \( 192 168 1 245 \) other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself this will be critical info to any linux user also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is admin well it s not the only allowed userid is an empty field this had me going for a few minutes 3 something that 99 of the world won t care about i like to have more access to the firmware for example other linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low level analysis of the box and the network it s attached to i think there are third party firmware loads that enable this	positive

the write up sounds good with many options and features but after closer examination i had to take it back first thing it appears that the front dv plug was an after thought for panasonic it s a rinky dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main av s plugs are located this is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit retro fitting it in wherever the tiny button within a button toggle switch for fastforward reverse etc looks like it s glued on it won t last long with normal use and it s hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit the menu interface is difficult to navigate the remote control is horrible a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features you might want to pass on this one remember the saying if it sounds too good to be true it probabily is	negative

i was tempted by the low price of this item the only reviewer before me gave it a 5 star rating although aware of the unreliability of a single review i decided to gave it a shot and paid 10 for shipping no other way since it s sold through a third party 28 later i was holding the biggest i ve seen in a while the construction feels very cheap and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3 year old and the worst of all only one of the two microphones worked even the one that works is horrible the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic it uses a 9 volt battery in each of the two mics and that s another 5 bucks out of my pocket you know what i ll probably have to eat the 33 since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns well i learned a lesson things are cheap for a reason	negative

the product was shipped to me in moscow after the first charge i took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours upon returning home and recharging the device i discover that it will not turn on anymore i suspect the battery is charging as the led indicates this as it is connected to ac power however disconnecting it from any power source it appears that the ac outlet and usb ports no longer function the device gives no auditory signal or led message so i don t know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it either way i m left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 watt solar panel anyway i strongly suggest getting the battery from tekkeon sorry about the bad review but i had my hopes for this device as well	negative

in my opinion sony s strength lies in its tvs this line of lcd sets are expensive but you ll definitely get what you pay for the picture quality is incredible the beauty of this set is also material it is a work of art while the internal speakers are decent i would have been just as happy not to have them but thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel you don t even know the speakers are there some reviewers have mentioned lcd clouding and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate google search but sony stands by its products and if you receive a set that is not up to standards they will rectify the situation also many reviewers are mentioning a lower quality picture it is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the tv and what signal will give you the optimal image not all hd signals are the same and will provide you with varying degrees of quality be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device but i have yet to see a signal that wasn t enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous panasonic tube set the interchangable bezels is a nice idea but only for those with deep \( er \) pockets the silver set alone is beautiful and if i had only one complaint it would be that it s harder to get matching sony peripherals in silver than you might think all in all it s the best lcd you can buy	positive

i just added this to my onkyo htib system and it s made all the difference in the world i m a bit of an audiophile \( on a reasonable budget \) with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10 polk in my truck i m most satisfied with the polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess i listen to a lot of music with double bass drumming and thought that this psw12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10 sub i like so much not the case what i get is very quick bass with that ground shaking impact that i always look for i m still going easy on er for the break in period but i can say that the trailer for kingdom of heaven \( included on the blu ray disc \) sounds absolutely stunning paired with my 57 sony hdtv trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days now is a great time to pick up one of these since the price seems to have recently dropped by about 50 throughout the web unbeatable sub for the money	positive

usually i discount negative reviews i think people may have sour grapes against a company or not understand how to install or work something i somewhat tech savvy i installed our wireless network that took a little doing i work as a technical recruiter so technology doesn t intimidate me i like technology so i had been nudging my husband for a print server so that i could print without going to the printer and plugging in he came home with this belkin product and went about installing it usually i like to research before i purchase a product but he wanted to handle this so he installed it and i went back and checked his work and he had followed the instructions exactly i know he had some trouble and had called tech support at my suggestion i would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support the only problem is that the printserver doesn t work so i tried installing the software on my pc and trying to problem solve from there i called the tech support hotline back and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time i waited for 2 hours then went out to run some errands there was still no message from a technician when i returned this morning my husband needed to get some work done from home he created a document and knowing that the print server did not work he wired up to the printer to print that way but now the printer won t respond to the signal so he can t print that way either so we deleted the belkin software and rebooted the computer he still can t print so i went back to my pc and tried to delete the software through the control panel it won t delete i am getting an error message i can t print either so now i am on hold with belkin customer assistance maybe it s a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is i swear i hear a little indian accent that doesn t mean that customer support has been outsourced to india and even if it is that doesn t mean customer support is bad but my experience with this is that while i can get a real live person on the phone he can t do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back when i tried to get my problem escalated i overwhelmed him and he put me on hold i am still on hold i have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight i called back from my cell phone and someone who sounded so much like the first operator i spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician and someone would call back in 1 2 hours when i strongly protested asked for his name asked for a number i could call directly he offered to transfer me immediately and now i have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone i am starting to sense a trend here my husband boiling over his inability to print an important document has gone off to work to print it there i am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call i usually discount negative reviews but this is really my experience with this product and if you are considering purchasing it i would encourage you to think that through a little further	negative

this little scanner is not worth the price it s got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use there is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency large gaps in between the frequency ranges it s programmed to receive and very limited memory capabilities the small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device looking from any angle and the backlit lcd display is unreadable reception of this scanner is poor on all of it s \( very limited \) bands though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna the scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources the squelch is practically useless on this thing it s either on or off it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it s set just above the static level on any empty frequency the sound quality from the built in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding but at least there is a jack for an external speaker on the bright side the chassis is well built and strong the buttons have a decent feel not to light nor too stiff the knobs turn with ease but will not change their settings due to road vibration they stay put where you set them at the fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall but it s not enough to make up for it s lacking feature set and poor performance	negative

this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you d hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod wouldn t stress the electronics i d give this thing 5 stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good	negative
i have to rate this product and this company as horrible i purchased the x2 in 12 2004 everything was fine in 6 2005 the lamp blew less than 300 hours on it i called the company they said sometimes it happens i questioned the projector they said i just needed a new lamp 300 00 later oh you can only get the lamps from them you can only get service on the x2 from them i get the new lamp it just blew again about 700 hours half of what the life should be additionally the fan died which may be why the lamp blew maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago \( when it was still under warranty but they wouldn t look at it \) no they say no the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place the projector was blown clean on a regular basis this projector was not mistreated or misused infocus says sometimes this happens they for 250 plus 30 00 shipping will fix the fan i also need to buy a new lamp another 300 the company keeps saying it is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc etc etc they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product i will get a new projector i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one my new projector will not will never be an infocus product they have failed to stand behind their product their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties don t buy infocus	negative

i ve had my e 10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it s performance my interests in radio pretty much revolve around a m \( or medium wave \) dx ing and shortwave listening it s performance on a m is on a par with the highly regarded kaito ka 1103 which i received for christmas this year shortwave performance is very close however the kaito is superior in this area \( and features ssb tuning as well \) f m the e 10 is well above average but falls short of the kaito ka 1103 i ve yet to see a radio that can equal the kaitos performance in this area but the e 10 is closer than most build quality ergonomics and appearance are second to none and better than most the slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a top of the line portable multi band receiver even though it s moderately priced it s lcd digital display is one of the largest and nicest i ve seen very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight other amenities such as 500 plus memories 12 24 hour clock i f shift and antennae trim which are both useful in shortwave reception local dx switch and the internal battery charger for nicad or nimh batteries all add up to make this a radio i m glad i purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel earbuds and reel up shortwave antennae are top notch now if you re wondering why after all this praise i only gave it a four star rating and not a five it s because eton did not provide ssb tuning capability on this receiver and it s a shame because it s shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it in my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio hence they only hit a triple \( which is way more exciting nonetheless i m a baseball nut too \) and not a home run	positive

this is a great piece of hardware the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me but in my apartment i would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker it s volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself the bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default the other thing is that i would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer that s not going to happen with this system you can t change that easily and yes the 5 disk changer is slow the maximum volume setting doesn t seem that loud to me but then i have the decibal settings at default all the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here it has all the flavors hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way i d like it too but i only tried rca and not the digital i have a sony 32 wega and i had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the dav fx100 reciever that works like a charm even with 5 1 sound from xbox one huge complaint i have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best i see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my tv there is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual beware four stars	positive

in general lexar s usb drive does its job just as well as other usb drives there isn t much of a difference except for the following 1 \) portability good it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain bad this rubber holder only lasts for so long \( in my case 6 8 months \) 2 \) it is extremely durable this drive survived a full 30 minute \( clothes \) washer cycle when i took it out of the washer i thought all the data and the drive was gone for good to my surprise \( after letting it dry for a day \) it worked just fine this is amazing i have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes \( not using all of my weight though \) a few times on carpet and concrete and still works fine finally i have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it s still fine 3 \) looks good it is very easy to see since it is bright red bad it is fatter than other usb drives and it is bright red the drive is pretty ugly it maybe good to note however that the drive s structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse the bright red color s advantage has already been mentioned above	positive

they clean the screen so to speak but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off it doesn t really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on but i still don t like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment the monitor would have been cleaner overall had i just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw since it doesn t affect picture during use but regardless i am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent i thought these would be a solution but they ve turned out to be just another problem i have to figure out	negative
i mean seriously i m running a ubuntu box here with other card type things sometimes i d have to modify or find drivers and wrappers for some stuff to work not with this i just slid it into the computer and wa bam makes my dvd player a bajillion times faster than it was before and just worked out of the box	positive
i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough	negative
i went from the first version of the audigy2 to this and it did increase my performace a tiny bit my old card was going out on me a lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping haven t had any of that yet \) i also didn t seem to have the mb problems that were stated in first review i have a asrock dual vsta \( new one made for windows vista \) with a good stereo setup this card sounds really nice i have a older but really nice 5 1 with 100watts for each speaker only 4 years old but have seen some really nice ones lately a lot of new games coming out have intense sound now vanguards sound has crappy options so you can t dumb it down and it can drag a system down esp one using on board sound i would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included amazons rating too	positive
i hate this unit with a passion and i sell the things its cheap 299 99 at most retail place right now and that s what you are getting the one died in 24 hours while plugged in and never turned back on it also directed us to a road that was headed into the pacific ocean there is no road across in the pacific last time i checked it acquired satelites once and then never acquired them again and good luck talking to customer service both i talked to didn t speak english a dreadful unit maybe tomtom could go work at walmar	negative

i purchased the lj3390 to replace an existing lj3320 the 350 rebate available until the end of oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase my main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the lj3390 over the lj3052 i now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully all run xp sp2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection software installation went flawlessly while i can t comment about hp versus other vendor software i can say that the lj3390 software is a major improvement over that of my lj3320 scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2x quite likely more like 3 4x printing of complex pages is also much faster exactly what i would expect from a newer generation print engine and an hp laserjet printer all in all i am very pleased that i upgraded it has met all my upgrade goals printing is faster scanning is much faster the network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on i haven t played with the fax side yet but am hoping this finally let s me retire my trusty standalone fax machine	positive
i just purchased this item two days ago \( thurs \) today \( sat \) i removed my 160gb seagate hhd from my kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet i used the firewire connection instead of usb and the drive access is much faster than it was with the usb connection on the other enclosure the price is a little steep compared to others but i got a generous rebate offer with my purchase although the case is plastic \( my other one was aluminum and plastic \) i won t be moving mine around so that won t be an issue	positive
i like this printer there a few minor quarks but it s fast and the prints come out good the one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight if it s lose it will start making bad prints it takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out tighten it and start printing again i am also using this with the mac osx os though the device says it will only work with pc and mentions something about the casio cw utility for use on a mac but no where on the casio site could i find the mentioned utility after some searching i cam e accross this this allows the cw 100 to work fine on a mac though i have never seen the pc software that comes with printer i have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options this is enough to get around since you can make a jpg version of your label put that in the print area and print away the jpg can be what ever image text you want resolution is great too i print at 300dpi all in all i found this to be a great purchase i make music and do not have the money to send out to have my cds done this print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost great the diyer	positive
i do all my burning on a standard windows media player and it s almost entirely data and music no video for my purposes these cd s sound great in some cases it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but nevertheless i m a big fan of the memorex and they re a steal if you catch the sale price recommended	positive
i would give a high recommendation for this tv it is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you re not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie the morning or evening news or the late shows in high def dvd player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the tv at all the picture is outstanding and isn t that what really matters in the end the only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation the tv has an auto on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the tv once it goes on it you are use the hdmi as i am to get signal from your cable box you must have the tv input mode set to hdmi but you can t set the auto on to the hdmi input \( it must be a channel number \) the engineers just didn t think that one through all the way oh well still a great tv	positive
we bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters it resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard drive crash that everyone fears but nobody thinks will happen to them attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they re left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find expecting our first child in less than three weeks we don t want to find ourselves in the same predicament especially with years of other irreplaceable photos financial data and other documents on our laptop now we re doing weekly monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive even if we don t completely stick with this new regimen it s better than what we used to do which though thankfully uneventful was absolutely nothing if that s not enough to make you want to buy this then the sony name quality reliability and ease of use should be the drive is small stylish easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position although it s a little loud when the drive is working it reads and writes cd r media up to 48x ultra speed plus cd rw up to 32x dvd r up to 16x and high speed dvd rw up to 8x after a lengthy initial full backup using the included nero backitup software \( about 8 gb onto 10 old cd r discs in 2 5 3 0 hours \) smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x dvd rw discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing copying and verifying everything backup copies of our 4 gb wedding dvd onto 8x dvd r discs took about 15 20 minutes the nero software seems very extensive but i haven t used much of it so far the interface is pretty intuitive and it s easy to find what you want to do but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who s new to this kind of software or doesn t want to spend a lot of time reading the pdf manual the only real complaint i have is with the backitup program s job scheduler which only gives you daily weekly and yearly frequency options \( you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months \) it takes forever to re scan files when building a new job on an existing one \( setting up subsequent daily weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup \) and the data you can change for an existing job is limited \( can t rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job \) overall great external dvd cd drive for watching video listening to music and backing up data good software that s intuitive and functional with some room for improvement but there s no real need for additional software you don t already have excellent value bought it at amazon for under 160 with taxes and free shipping and got a 30 mail in rebate from sony also bought pack of 25 ritek 8x dvd rw discs from thetechgeek com for 33 delivered and they threw in a free 10 pack of velocity 8x dvd r discs so for well under 200 and a little effort you too can view hear copy and or backup your valuable photos videos tunes and other data in no time	positive

the cables to go 4 port usb ps unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device the video card goes into some blacked out video mode the pc has to be shutdown the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc you must bo the port and watch the reboot then card is ok until next reboot unattended frustrating the keyboard and mouse are ok but with wireless keyboard mouse combo the box can not be on auto scan mode too many drawbacks	negative

functions absolutely flawlessly under vista 64bit \( unlike most other cards such as my older wintv pvr 150 \) if not for the next paragraph i d give it five stars for just this heck it does better under vista x64 than my old card did under winxp 32 \( disclaimer i tested the analog video only not the digital \) but i discovered that it was running extrememly hot even when just sitting their idle so hot that you literally can t even touch it ouch i ended up removing it from the case as i didn t trust it perhaps it s a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it s not in use emailed tech support but they offered no real answer other than it shouldn t be warm at all	negative
the edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge is easy to install as well as use i would love to have given it 5 stars \( it deserves them \) but one thing that does not work correctly and really bugs me is the calories expended it couldn t be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way the first day that i installed it i took it for a quick 1 mile test ride it indicated that in that mile i burned 100 calories wish it were true but it is not unfortunetly the next day i was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride but crashed as i started out and have not riden since \( 3 days \) i wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further after 2 hours it read 0 were burned i just took it for a car ride of 7 miles in those 7 miles driven in a car it indicates i burned nearly 600 calories again i wish but no way other than that flaw whioh i hope they fix with a software update i highly recommend this product it all other ways it is great	positive

this is the perfect little tv dvd for a little girl s room the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands \( volume channel change \) my daughter age 4 loves it i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny very close together i can barely read what each button does because the labels print is also very tiny this is annoying when in my daughter s darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you can t eject or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode in other words when i go to put in a dvd i can t just push open nothing will happen you have to find the right button choose dvd from a choice of 3 4 things and only then will the tray slide open all in all these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again although it would be nice if they did come out w a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons symbols for a small child to recognize one great thing i want to point out there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards \( something not all dvd players offer \) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre movie ads you can ff right to the beginning of the movie	positive
i did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the serial port on a computer since most new computers use usb for serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited my two newly purchased hp computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product i would not have bought it had i known this i have not used the gps since i bought it it will probably be tossed out the serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package so you don t see it prior to opening the package once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs i have seen the plastic clamshell is so hard to open that i think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors the cut plastic is also dangerous	negative
notice all the happy five star ratings are from people that just bought this mp3 i have had mine for 9 months i have had this mp3 since christmas 2005 i bought the white 512 for my son at the same time whith in 3 weeks my son s was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how it got crunched enough to never work again i was not happy also in a few months mine started to have issues the very tiny menu button is rediculous and the main toggle was a complete failure for sony i accually removed the cover to the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume how stupid i am so mad about this mp3 player i am going to buy a creative v i have done a lot of research this time and i will not buy another sony the hold button that is part of this sliding door never works i find the player dead in my gym bag all the time apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on for hours and than you have a dead player maybe sony should have given us a on off button than this would not happen dont do it folks look into other options even my mom s ipod nano is better designed than this joke of an mp3 player	negative

for 99 this should be a much better remote if you watch movies in the dark you have to use the glow button guess what you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least also logitech has over simplifed the remote you can t program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly if you have to go into the device menu a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume why not have an option to program each button period but the remote is useless now because of the low battery life do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month ridiculous only remote i have ever had like this	negative

i bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive i was using crashed and took my backup with it the maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes the initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too so far so good the problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn t backup new or updated files the scheduled backup doesn t work at all the light flashes so you think it s working but it doesn t backup any new or updated files the synch is useless too it s like the backup function it will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn t synch any of your new or updated files like it s supposed to it s like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that s it to get around the fact that it won t automatically back up my files i have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as i have to remember what files have been updated and or are new i would not buy this product again it s not an automatic backup drive it s just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn t reliable at all if you need a backup drive look elsewhere sorry to say this one is a complete waste of money	negative
i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr i then saw the pricetag and unlike the other people i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr it is definitely not worth it for something i get for 8 extra a month attached to my cable service yes i do love the tivo interface and searching but i will not pay that much for it it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price knock 700 dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind	negative
you will appreciate this product only if you don t have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	positive
i have an ipaq pda and i own a tomtom gps both of which work well this combo ipaq tomtom is in the rough and needs to undergo some re tooling i m surprised that other reviewers mention what i deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star for example the travel companion stalls and needs soft resets for a right handed person the stylus is awkward support is not good moving through programs can be painfully slow the gps tracking lags i depend on my gps and pda for business travel buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it s loaded with some fun stuff but not if you need something dependable while on the road	negative

awesome concept however i live in an apartment that doesn t have any south facing windows so i was unable to get a signal i strongly advise against calling the xm radio help from a phone that won t use up your cell phone minutes had to call them four different times and all they did was read me the instruction manual and tell me that if i don t have signal my radio won t work \( i had clearly established that fact already \) i recieved the radio for free because of a rebate and didn t even intend on getting xm radio but figured since the unit was free and an mp3 player to give it a try i was going to break down and buy the 70 car kit but then i ran across the agt sportscaster for 20 which came with a car kit since i can t use it in my house i hook up the home base to the car kit and at least i can use it that way this ended up being a lot of work for something i wasn t sure i wanted in the first place haven t used the mp3 player yet but napster does not seem the most user friendly \( i have the majority of my songs on itunes	negative

this is a great tv bought after looking around for months receive hdtv signals about a dozen without cable box the number will continue to rise but all of the main shows and programs are in hd especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in hd true you will only get about 720p resolution from the broadcast over the air currently but when the blue ray hd movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price this will become the standard and this tv has 2 hdmi ports so you are ready to go i have had another crt sharp which i have liked and this product is no different picture is amazing some analog channels dont look that great but i am at the point where where i would rather watch whatever is on an hd channel note i am in what is considered an upgraded cable section the tv has the tuner to receive hd without the box as i have said but i can t speak to sections that are not upgraded so you may want to look into that nice to receive without paying for extra equipment	positive

i am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try i have a six year old hitachi dvd player and i lost the remote i couldn t play anything without it because the buttons on the player don t allow me to select any tracks the instructions on this remote are incredibly easy it found my tv automatically because it s set for a sony tv by default when i had to locate a code for my dvd player i got worried none of the 3 hitachi dvd codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process but there s a search function to use in that situation which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip s library till one works it found one within seconds and i was up and running i think i m going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms	positive
our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office after we set them up it works just fine we didn t use any of the advanced features at that time after reading the user s guide and online forum at the linksys web site we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is not user replaceable you need to send it in for replacement sure enough we now have two routers that can t retain any configuration settings they all reset to factary default all of a sudden one after 1 year the other after 1 and half year also note we updated one of the router to newest firmware which prevents any kind of connection from the internet needless to say my boss is really crossed with me because i was the one recommend the model	negative
overall this item works as expected but requires to be reset \( i e cycle the power \) once every 24 48 hours i will be replacing it with another model	negative
you really can t go wrong with this one not great response but what do you expect for less than 300 on the other hand the possibilities for this surround system are endless want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system \( this is how my daughter has it configured \) it s our second one first one died as a result of recent electrical storm \( yes the circuit was protected but so what \) couldn t be happier for the investment	positive
we love the card scanner it s the best everyone who is a recruiter should have one it saves time and space	positive
when i bought these i was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my mp3 player in my pocket not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound i didn t expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product the cord also has a built in volume control so i don t have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume the buds are quite comfortable i have worn them for hours at a time with no problem i love these	positive

a couple years ago i got a projector for the big screen effect and decided to finally get my mini advents out of storage for the surround sound my old pioneer receiver worked ok but i decided it was time to upgrade i have 30 year old speaker lab \( build em yourself \) speakers up front with the advents in back the only complaint i have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table \( yes i m old \) so i kept the pioneer for dedicated service to the record player i have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school for him it s a breeze i don t even look at the directions i just say here having said that i think this thing is great if you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system \( wow \) for your records and cassettes ahh technology i love this thing i can understand that some folks want something better but for 95 of us this will be the last one you will ever need highly recommended 4 stars for the lack of lp connection otherwise 5 all the way	positive
let me start off by saying like some others out there theses seemed like a dream come true got my first pair \( yes i said first \) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard they sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected i was saving in the meantime for the ac 1 soundcard that goes w the head phones one day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead double check with oter pc s and verify bad headset ok no problem amazon was great with the exchange got my 2nd pair in a week i decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up got the card for my b day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a irq conflict i believe o well just bad luck i guess sent it back again amazon very good about it soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have eax or x fi which alot of games use today i got an email saying that amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well so there you have it razer seems to have issues with it s production thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing amazon was great and i m happy they didn t just ship me another pos	negative
ok so this is probably not the best protection for your ipod but what do you want for 6 bucks i m cheap if you re not buy something more expensive perhaps pros it does protect the screen and click wheel nicely the flip up top magnetically shuts and holds securely which i guess helps if you happen to drop it cons the belt clip is ridiculous it s not a stationary clip instead it spins around which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater this product is not for the joggers the leather strap that comes with it is too short which makes it difficult to operate the ipod when it s around your neck it seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under pros above but as long as you never take your ipod out of the case no worries this is made for the 30 gb ipod video but it s actually a little big for it it leaves room for the ipod to slide up and down in the case it makes accessing the hold switch difficult sometimes when the flip up top is down it s easier to just open the top if you don t care about the cons and you are cheap like me go ahead and buy it	negative
sure these floppy s are inexpensive they arrived on time thanks amazon but the photo doesn t give it any credit these don t come with a plastic carrying case like the photo just a crappy cardboard box come on guys wheres the plastic case for these things now they will be flopping all over the place in my desk drawers etc	negative
i bought this because i wanted an encrypted device that i could use to offload personal documents i receive while traveling for work and then read them using my mac \( s \) at home lexar jd ii is the only product i found advertised to work with both macs and pcs at the same time my primary mac is an intel mac early on i realized the encryption utility only runs on ppc macs okay so i figured i d use it on the ppc mac mini and everything seeemed fine at first then i hit a problem where my mac mini could not read video dvds a little search on the mac support forums and i found that installing lexar jd software disables video dvd support on my mac fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall aside from the problems with the macs i also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned which is that you must be logged in as a local administrator to use the encryption software under windows since my work pc is a member of a domain i had to create a local account log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway kingston data traveler elite works fine under windows domain logins unfortunately for me they don t have mac software yet so in summary the current lexar encryption software can t be used on a windows domain machine can t be used on an intel mac breaks the dvd on a ppc mac it s not for me however if you are using the lexar strictly on stand alone windows pcs or you don t require encryption it should be okay	negative

i purchased this usb light fan combo mainly for the fan i m one of those guys who is a human heater always a little warmer than everyone else i use this fan when i m studying in the library on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk it provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over i can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running of course you can see right through the blades the fan runs quietly too i ve had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn t running a quickly as normal i just pop off the rotor head adjust the blades a bit \( they are flexible vinyl and i give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case \) pop the rotor head back on and it s good as new again while i like this product a lot i doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but i still think it s well worth it my only regret is that i didn t order two or three of these for future back ups if needed the light works well too it does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user \( a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but i think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well \) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document	positive
i have used this machine for a few months now but have not made use of all possible features however this is what i can say basic copying fax scanning excellent scanning with character recognition excellent but would prefer to have options ala omnipage duplex printing \( printing on both sides \) very good except the menu digging is ackward build quality and overall performace excellent prints fast few jams feels very sturdy ease of use very good and straight forward features excellent loaded with capabilities this machine is beautiful and no other machine i have used comes close save for high end office machines costing thousands i can t get over how happy i am with this one i ve been waiting for a quality mfc since before they came out and finally i am satisfied highly recommended	positive
i bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17 laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is the storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag i also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to as an engineer i must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop	positive

i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included however when it arrived there was no battery upon questioning amazon about the battery the customer service rep said he could give me a 5 credit for the batteries i asked how the battery could only be worth 5 he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for the bag is ok but don t order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers	negative
i got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my mbp \( silver theme \) someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should or in the wrong way but mine works fine cons light indicator shows exactly which usb ports are in use small in size has usb port on top which comes in handy enough usb power so far i didn t have to plug in the power charger yet comes with a usb plugged light comes with a extended usb cable \( for you to connect the hub to your computer \) the usb plug is silver transparent in color which looks kinda nice prons it camed with some minor scratches on the hub s surface although i just took it out from its sealed package carefully those surface scratches aren t too noticeable \( didn t want to return it and waste time money \) as many have already mentioned the usb cable is connected to the hub permanently other thoughts the usb cable connected the the hub is pretty thin it d be a good feature \( look less noticeable \) f you treat the cable nicely but if you are harsh on the cable it feels like it may break will be great if this hub has firewire ports but i m very happy with this item	positive
i have no axe to grind with bose i originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up this speaker has an incredibly small footprint if space is limited this is not a bad option however being honest this is not a great center channel speaker choosing speakers is like the addage certain horses for certain courses your budget your room your components all play a part i have two home theater setups one is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from polk audio the other is a dedicated theater utilizing definitive technologies with b k reference 7 1 processing clearly the bose vcs 10 can not hold its own with my larger setup however i have run it with my polk audio s and it was workable the timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my polk csi3 but it was not awful my bottom line you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker can you buy a better one in this price range i think so if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system you should always buy the best components within your budget but remember you are building a system it s not just about one speaker if this speaker fits your space and \( more importantly \) matches your other speakers then it may be the right speaker for you	negative

not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it ll do fine careful there is no plug in at the back so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it s easy to use and pretty cool looking ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff	positive

wow i m surprised by the reviews made here about this product despite the bad reviews i bought it anyway i still believe in a motorola guess what not bad i bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my siemens the siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago this moto phone has the features most people will ever need the shared phonebook is very valuable a loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent i don t understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality ok the range is not as good as my 2 4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home after about 75 meters with 3 walls in between i can start to hear the voice i m speaking to crackles i just did this for test but i can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house i am running a 2ghz wi fi and do not hear any interference with regard to the phonebook i wish i can enter more characters each address the maximum characters i can enter is only 11 i think i can enter about 20 on my siemens another minor quirk is when someone called i could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party not with this phone i still have to press the flash bottom everytime before i can start talking build quality is excellent it is a little on the heavy side which i like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic even if i squeeze the handset hard i didn t hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping i tried the pana v tech uniden ge and att in a local store and the motorola is tops you will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here i personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around if you do not see it that way it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product	positive

after doing a fair amount of internet research about mp3 players and their features i was under the impression that i would go with an ipod having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years i have never been fond of the mac and have always been a little biased towards pc s this added to my reticence to own a mac product and the growing complaints about service on the ipod being a bit over priced i forged on i started reading through all of the reviews i could find on the internet and as always found a wealth of them here on amazon to my dismay all the reviews i could find on product names i knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely thats is until i got to the iaudio line the reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things i could easily overlook i love the control i am big guy with big hands and i have rarely if ever pushed the control and not had the result i was intending i have had my iaudio x5 for over a month and i have nothing bad to say in the least i am an avid linux user and it works flawlessly with linux the sound quality is phenomenal except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those the fm tuner is great \( you wont get that on an ipod \) i travel a lot and i pipe my x5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port what else can i say this is a great product with great features and it looks good too i also bought a case from zcover which fits the purpose but i think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market a satisfied custome	positive

i purchased this item on 6 3 06 from amazon and a 250gb ata ide hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor it all went together fine and i could mount the volume easily enough the first thing i noticed is that it s wi fi wouldn t work with wep with my powerbook it d work without encryption on the airport extreme but not with wep or with wpa i noted that and used it without the wi fi for a few days i noted it wouldn t hold time at all consistently it wouldn t register a network time server s data and was always in the wrong time zone so i had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time but it would still drift about ten minutes per day and then jump an hour or two randomly making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy i found it slow to mount and it would sometimes unmount over working wep wi fi or hardwired gigabit connections which was disheartening i then decided to call tech support which is when things went from bad to worse calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff the tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around which too up to another thirty minutes folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e mails after 12 hours with customer support over two weeks and a not yet released firmware update it would work with wpa psk or open but still no wep they couldn t fix the time drift issue i repeatedly asked for a replacement but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time or another firmware update they just wouldn t spare me the trouble and replace the unit until i was ready to scream by this time i was out of amazon s return policy timeframe they refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts i even sent a letter telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or i d post my experience here on amazon of course i got a replacement unit with no other reply now i ve got to get rid of the thing onebay or whatever take the loss and move on i would never buy another d link product i would avoid this thing like anthrax weaponized anthrax i bought an iomega nas unit which works very well has multiple drives and raid and though it costs more provides decent value and it works d link has a lot to learn about customer service and should not release beta untested products to the consumer market shame on them	negative

so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront 2 on pc and it works like a dream i also like the x box controller layout \( offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic \) than the ps2 style controller that is the logitech rumble pad it also has better grips than a ps2 controller the only things i think are bad about it are the following 1 it is not modeled on the large xbox controller but rather the regular one which is ok for most people but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long 2 i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game this isn t an issue with battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator but i could see where if a game didn t have as good an interface \( or maybe older games \) this pad could suffer in this regard 3 this isn t so much an issue for me but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out i don t care too much because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything i will still use it even if it does die overall a great controller i actually would give it a 4 5 rating but that isn t an option here	positive

i was given the ique m3 for christmas of 2005 a few months into the new year i dropped it onto pavement and it broke for 99 garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which i consider a fair price unfortunately the refurb unit couldn t play directions at full volume so i returned it for another refurb this unit fell off the windshield still in it s cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits i called garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit they d look at it under warranty i had told the guy what happened so i was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications \( or words to that effect \) even though clearly not i have no idea why units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have for some the mapping software on the m3 will appear crippled it is a basic drive from here to there unit it does not allow you to load way points points of interest and the like each of the units had quirks on the first one every time i inserted the sd card with maps windows player \( or whatever it s called \) would start up and ask me if i wanted to search the card for tunes the second one had inaudible volume the fourth one has a problem common to the first one the brightness resets itself randomly to zero yep zero the first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero so you may think the unit is not turning on but it s on you just can t see anything on the screen if you re outside you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if it s dark you need a flashlight the current one will do a hard reset if i start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when i put it in the cradle this means i have to do the full new user routine touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone after i ve gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where i m going but i can t load destinations from contacts as they re gone so i have to type them all in by hand if the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead it forgets everything and i have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone i complained about this to support at garmin and i was assured this is a microsoft feature and that garmin can do nothing about it they recommended that i buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an sd card where it will not be lost so now i carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data i did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you can t retrieve your data from the backup sd card unless you have told the program to save as self extracting archives i learned it the hard way of course to restore i pop out the detailed maps sd card insert the backup card navigate to the file explorer navigate to the sd card open the contents of the sd card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to ok that it has finished \( just a minute or two with my small amount of data \) click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then i m good to go i can t do it while i m driving of course so if the unit resets on its own i just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where home is which means i have to type it or other locations into the where to dialogue the unit defaults to 3d directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as i can t look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where i am vis a vis the map i m sure this is my shortcoming and i then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which i can t do while driving it also defaults to different displays for day and night the night display uses a dark background and i have found that the menus for the windows programs use a transparent background with black text so i can t read the menu selections against the dark display and the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if i lose power or the unit resets when i start the car or sometimes when i put it in the cradle on the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas it also formats all numbers as us numbers i have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the \( xxx \) xxx xxxx format even though they are longer and don t start with an area code in the calendar if i have meetings scheduled outside my time zone i enter them at the time they re scheduled then when i get there i have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone so i never use the visited time zone feature and the unit assumes i m still in my home zone wherever i may travel i have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which i have the lat long coordinates i camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads i quickly lose where i am and have to zoom out which loses the road on the whole the directions part of the m3 is excellent it gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations on the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper after a year of use i can t put up with it anymore i ll take garmin s word that this is all a shortcoming of windows mobile and not garmin s fault but i can t put up with it anymore i ll switch to magellan or tomtom or some other unit that isn t windows based and that doesn t completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesn t randomly do a hard reset doesn t randomly set the brightness to zero and doesn t assume all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas maybe another manufacturer will let me import pois and way points from other people s files	negative
i travel a lot especially to europe and hate taking lots of cables with me for the vonage router laptop cellphone and crackberry the ijuice unit looked like a good idea however the unit just failed during my trip leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back up bad idea a friend switched me on to charging everything via usb i just bought a cheap 5 00 usb charger for the nokia the crackberry charges via usb anyway so i just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110 240v adaptor and i was all set laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time single point of failure is the laptop however apple does a great universal adaptor \( you can get uk us etc plugs \) with usb for charging ipods for 20 all in one neat unit you can just stick the usb for the nokia in the back seriously don t waste your money unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can t charge via usb using usb is far lighter far more reliable you don t loose the tips	negative
the cam is good it has a special feature to show the person object by automatic adjustment and a very good part abt it is it has a built in mike and helps a lot	positive
i ve been looking for this style of phone for a while looks great works great but it s so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use it s both more narrow width wise and length wise than my samsung sph a900 when the samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone i want a small sleek mobile phone but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home if it we re 1 3 larger it d be excellent maybe a great phone for women also it does not have any plugs for headsets i am returning mine to amazon	negative
i ve been a gamer for almost 20 years this is the best mouse i ve ever owned it is fast accurate well formed and constructed i would definitely recommend it the dpi adjustment is a nice touch i prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy this mouse is just right	positive
i ve been using this remote since it was released better than any others i ve run into but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too be prepared to give up a couple of hours when it s working it s a 5 star device however read on as to why i give it a 2 as i type this my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support 3rd call today i simply got a new pvr programmed ok but it isn t the default device when i watch tv also it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr it s a satellite as a pvr it couldn t be added to activities because you don t have a device that will change channels news to me never known a pvr that couldn t change channels literally 4 friggin hours so far and it still not right at some point the tv suddenly stopped turning on 2 3 hours on that issue and it s still not right tv does not go on until i hit the help button on the remote to add insult to injury i can t access the website enter my email as an id and am told it s already in the database i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized i hate that the software doesn t have a simple home button you have to go through several menus to get back to it hold time now up to 52 minutes i have to hang up for an appt so the hold has to be repeated again oh yeah i also dislike the size of the buttons especially the numbers cell phone sized no doubt designed for a dainty child i could go on but if another comes out with a product like this one i ll be looking hard at it	negative
i bought this mouse while on the road when i forgot my microsoft wireless mouse i do not have the original packaging otherwise i would have taken in back the usb receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back i often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card after a week of use the mouse started to wig out erratic movement etc if the mouse is left unattended for any length of time i cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons the only thing that works is using the wheel to scroll the really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until i unplug the receiver i thought this was because i was using a mac i experienced the same behavior on my pc as well i m going to throw this away since i would not wish it on my enemy	negative
i have owned the dmr es40v for over 6 months it is a combo dvd vcr unit i have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit the manual it is imperative to have the manual this machine is somewhat complicated and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary if everything is working correctly you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it it is overly time consuming though since the items don t seem to logically flow if you dig long and hard enough though they are in there somewhere the set up being somewhat experienced at setting up a home theater this was generally easy the text and pictures were sufficient searching through the function menu i learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons this is needlessly confusing of course the auto clock set function isn t very accurate \( i haven t seen an accurate one yet \) dvd playback the general playback is pretty straight forward i really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my jvc progressive player \( which is 3 years older \) finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult a zoom feature is missing many convenience features are not present dvd recording recording onto a dvd ram disc is a dream compared to old fashioned vcr tapes i really enjoy using them a quirk you must have the unit in stand by to record from the scheduler this mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another \( on the same disc \) you must wait until the unit begins recording then select the show to watch from the navigator the uhf tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19 other weak channels record but not 19 this problem started about 6 months after initial set up there is an annoying bug with daylight savings time and the newer extended time period the panasonic web site suggests going into the set up menu and unchecking the dst box thus removing the feature if this did anything it would allow you to set the clock manually being without the automatic dst adjustment would not be annoying but even though you turn off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm est this ruins any tv scheduling you had set this malady persisted until the date of the former dst spring ahead arrived several weeks of scheduling hell i requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised no message no number to call just a promise to call again when i was home the vcr use this feature is really buggy you are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote but this only worked for a month or two when a tv show is scheduled for recording the unit won t tape it if you merely insert a cassette it doesn t recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move either playing a little or fast forwarding reversing this is really annoying last impression the last movie \( last king of scotland \) i watched took over the machine the remote control would not function the disc would not stop and the disc could not be ejected it was necessary to unplug the unit restart it eject the disc and totally reset all menu items which were randomly reset to various settings worse some settings are no longer selectable one other movie would not even play in the machine forcing me to use the trusty jvc unit i must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what i read at this forum and other ones these units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption i recommend looking elsewhere	negative
please be aware of an important issue with this cable even though it is recommended for the etrex gps series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector i had to return mine and bought one at the local rei	negative
just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced this is a 5 00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit it will protect against scratching but only the areas of the unit you re not really concerned about the screen is totally exposed so it can be scratched when in the unit i m sure that s so you can see the screen better but a clear protective cover \( that can open and close \) over the screen would have been nice anyway at 25 00 this is too much to spend i m ordering a leather cover with a kick stand \( which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table \) for less than the price of this product i feel i just flushed 25 00 bucks down the drain hopefully you will not	negative
i was very up set this walkman was a gift it cost 90 00 6 months ago it did not work right i could not get good reception at all it was complete static on all stations i think it was defective because i always buy sony products and they work great i still have the walkman my grandma gave me 11 years ago and it still works buyer beware don t buy walkmans from amazon on line i susspect amazon may have sold me someone s return item although i can t prove it you ll be better off going to target or best buy in case a refund is needed shoppers check all your purchase s with in a 30 day period so you won t get stuck with something that does not work if i did that i could have got a full refund good luck frien	negative
