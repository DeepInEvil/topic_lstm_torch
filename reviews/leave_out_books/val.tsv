thest waterford flutes are absolutely beautiful i know that some may think they are a little pricey but its worth it they make a great bride groom flute glass for the wedding reception also its a great remembrance of your day they are so cute	positive
this is a significant improvement over the 750 model the 750 model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the 760 to replace that the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed	positive
i really like these plates i bought the crocks as well and have no issues with them the go together really nicely if you are serving soup and salad for dinner guests i love the colors and i am happy with my purchase the price was attractive as well	positive
these are great knives especially for the price they are just like the pro s line from henckels only are not hardened the same way they are sharp the chefs knife sliced a very ripe tomato straight out of the box they have excellent weight and balance and the handles are comfortable all in all a great buy i can t believe i used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible definitely worth their weight in gold	positive
we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone i built a knife holder to use in a drawer now with the wusthof 25 slot i have removed my home made holder the drawer can be used to store other items i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years there is no need to buy a lot of new knives just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use you can t go wrong with this super storage block	positive
the best product ever i have 5 cats and let me tell you if it weren t for this product i would have gone insane a long time ago \( or i d just have a very stinky household \) have used it for a long time and will continue to do	positive
just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back even on maximum setting it hardly toasts we tried different breads different settings and it just doesn t work right we even tried toasting \( on maximum \) one lot of bread \( not good \) and followed it by another lot of bread \( better but not adequate \) on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread forget it on the up side the toaster looks good but for 80 it should toast better than my old 9 99 black and decker	negative
bought this model would not brew a full cup of coffee no matter what i did called customer service and they sent me a new one this one also did not work all it did was flash blue lights and never brewed a cup tossed it out and bought a different model by black and decker have had it for months and never had a problem with the new model	negative
in anthoney bourdain s book kitchen confidential he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs don t use henkle or wustoff knives they use global cat cora of american iron chef also uses global knives i needed a good knife in my kitchen so i decided to check out global as well first of all it s incredibly light if i m chopping a lot of onions for a french onion soup or making a big batch of mirepoix for some beef stock i notice that lightness then there s the balance see that notch where the blade meets the handle pick the knife up by that notch and it balanced exactly level try that with a standard knife and you ll see how handle heavy they are finaly the edge these knives are insanely sharp they cut like a dream i just went to a knife sharpening clinic by wustoff and they suggest honeing your knife with 5 or 6 stroks on a steel before every meal that you cook i ve found that this keeps the edge razor sharp however you should realize that the edge on these knives is at 15 degrees not 20 degrees so adjust the angle you use to hone the edge overall it s an amazing knife take care of it and it will serve you as a professional quality tool for a long time	positive
i made a mistake in buying this item thinking since i had one when i was little it would be similiar it is not the edges are stiff and strings are pulling out the fuzz all over the blanket gets all over your sheets it is a raggedy sorry substitute for my cozy soft one i remember	negative
i have loved every le creuset product i have purchased with the big exception of the whistling teakettle i did away with it a couple of months ago and bought the brittany model to replace it the whistling kettle burned my hand on several occasions as the design of the spout allowed the hot water to spit and jump right out of the pot the whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat the water would still jump from the spout while a little larger than i would have liked the brittany does not have the same problem and the whistle can be safely flipped up before pouring i have been very pleased with my new kettle and would recommend the brittany by far over the whistling	negative
as a le creuset cast iron fan it was only natural that one day i would try out their stoneware products while maintaining the same color options and increasing their product offerings i still prefer the cast iron products over the stoneware even so there are times when the stoneware fits a need the cast iron cannot effectively fulfill the stoneware is not intended for use on the stovetop besides this the stoneware can go from the oven microwave to the table and then to the refrigerator virtually non porous le creuset s stoneware is fired at 2156 degrees making it resistant to chipping cracking and staining the enameling results in an easy to clean and scratch resistant surface and will not absorb odors or flavors and resists moisture absorption this line is sure to perform for many years the stoneware line has many of the same qualities the cast iron line is known for this pie dish can be used for ice cream pies crisps cobblers pies shepard s pie tamale pie or any other number of dishes pros fits a need le creuset s cast iron line sometimes cannot same high quality standards found in le creuset s cast iron line but lighter weight made to last for many years cons not intended for use on the stoveto	positive
first i liked this press good coffee reasonable price but in 3 weeks operation the press itself has already broken the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken may be this pres is good for ones a year usage but not for everyday	negative
this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before it also heats very evenly the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem	positive
i love this carafe it is perfect for making flavored water with sliced lemons limes oranges the narrow neck means that the fruit won t fall into your glass while you are pouring and the fruit staying put also means it can steep in the water longer yu	positive
for many years i had a presto pressure cooker but when the sealing ring didn t work a few years back i tossed it out thinking i could never get a replacement ring i missed having that pot i m glad to have one once again stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one but tonight will be spare ribs the new pot is nothing like my 30 year old one it works the same in the end though i would have opted for the aluminum as that was what i had but my husband bought the stainless steel i don t think it makes a difference for the price except in appearance	positive
my daughter used this set and now my son uses it we threw out the fork by mistake so i m ordering another set the fork is just perfect for a toddler but my almost 6 year old still loves the fork i d highly recommend this	positive
i placed a substantial order mattresses sofa set table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was too much nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio	negative
the set is lovely and coordinates perfectly with my ocr china set the box is also beautiful i wish they d give you a diagram for placement of the flatware in the box for those of us who are first timers	negative
i bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills i thought this one seemed to have the better reviews so i bought it i really love it it heats up pretty quickly and has enough space for 2 3 people 4 people would have to eat slower but it does have enough broiler space and its square to have people at all 4 sides we use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal the only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say most of it comes off very easily but some spots of cooked grease remain it comes of with some elbow grease and a scrubby but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was	positive
its a throw like a blanket i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it it would be better than what i wasted my money on also dont wash this with anything else the die leaks	negative
this cute little casserole is great for making soups or casseroles for 2 4 people i use it for my morning oatmeal soup for lunch and casseroles for dinner retains heat so foods stay warm clean up is a breeze i have the green pepper but want the red and yellow one too	positive
we got this as a present and had high hopes to actually use it as a microwave it takes over 7 minutes to warm something up and forget about making microwave popcorn it just doesn t pop the kernals overall lots of features but it s the worst microwave i ve ever owned	negative
the product is everything as described plus it stores alot of laundry and wheels easy	positive
pros i have two chocolate labs therefore i have a lot of hair to deal with the vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt \( wood floors \) it works alright on rugs cons not cheap loud the plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you can t carry it you just have to roll it instead not a big deal	positive
i am a contractor and when i recently remodeled doug and susans basement i was eventually shown how to use the grinder to make espresso while on breaks unfortunately i started taking lots of breaks good espresso the grinder is quiet precise and efficient like an excellent sub contractor or a good table saw the grinder was great i use a burr grinder at my house but you can t even talk over the thing this one whirs below a conversation level then stores the suberbly consistant ground coffee i then pull the lever a couple times to dispense premeasured amounts into the doser that is resting in its holder on the machine and there it is break is on thanks for the good times and good espresso on my way to hawk some of my tools to buy one of these things it s worth it	positive
this product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic amazingly it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer \( just a thin cardboard box with no padding \) the only real gripe i have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper the hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side this does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities one of the reasons why i picked this particular product in the first place if it were not for the flawed lid i would have given this product a five star rating	positive
these colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys they are treated with catnip but to be honest i don t think my cat knows the difference unlike their zanies furry mice counterparts zanies rainbow mice also rattle since they have tiny pebbles inside them a word of caution about this though the pebbles are encased inside a semi rigid plastic cartridge \( which makes up the body of the mouse \) the furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued after my cat played with one of the mice the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed since there are pebbles inside unsupervised play might not be very safe it s best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them other than that these are great toys and the price quantity quality ratio is pretty good quantity is important here because due to their small size most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture since you get 60 mice in this package you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action in the long run it s a lot cheaper than buying them individually	positive
i purchased this machine in november 2005 when working it is a wonderful but it started to leak within 6 weeks i sent it back for repair or replacement 3 weeks later i received a badly damaged box not the shipping box but the bodum box the replacement had a manufactures date of 03 04 2 years old it had obviously been used coffee and water stains were present several scratches and parts were missing i called customer service and the supervisor promised they would ship a new one immediately and i would receive it no later than 2 23 2006 three days after i was promised i would receive the new machine it has yet to arrive i called customer service today and was informed they have no record of shipping a new unit and could i call back next week the very used replacement machine was shipped back last week i regret making this purchase	negative

i m not sure the timer i receib ved works properly the timing mechanism dseems accurate however the sound it makes when the time is up is more like a ticking if you are nor right near it you ll never hear it	negative
this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it doesn t create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one	negative
unless you love the look of this pepper grinder i d suggest you look elsewhere when compared to a generic grinder this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds i ve gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them with this grinder you ll always get a huge variation in the grind some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable you ll have trouble turning it not recommended	negative
it works well and it s good for the price not too stable and sturdy but it gets the job done just fine	positive

i find it more than a bit ridiculous that pur charges 40 dollars for their product and 20 25 dollars for their replacement filters i have owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use why because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse removing and reinstalling the unit does not help i have become so frustrated by pur water products that i will never again purchase anything made by them i just installed a brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the brita is more reasonably priced at up to 15 dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit do yourself a favor and avoid this over priced piece of junk at all costs	negative
very hard to put together drawers came broken both times cute though not at all sturd	negative
as great as it looks i can t get past the incomplete directions \( only printed outside of the box no directions inside \) to get it installed on the wall it says pull out the plastic end cap haven t a clue what the plastic end cap is nor how to pull it out nor how to install the screws that hold it on the box may have to return	negative
after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one it has been great and i couldn t ask for anything better or more easy to use i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross odors or tastes my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated cleanup is easy also after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be i would recommend this with no caveats	positive
it isn t exaclty what i expected but it works it looks nice and holds a lot of coats and doesn t tip over it serves its purpose are there better quality coat racks yes but for this price its worth it	positive
it s a three piece roasting rack two sides and a long pin that holds them together when assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles it s supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey and after using it with a 22 lb turkey i believe that claim the tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do in fact my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our maxam steel roaster which is currently my favorite roasting pan the truly cool thing about this rack however isn t the handles or the shape it s that nifty pin at the bottom you see you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin then you simply remove the sides that s it they pull right away from the turkey leaving it behind on its platter no more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack it s right where you want it already for all of its non stick properties the rack did take some real elbow grease to clean particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars but that isn t very surprising it does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product however also there is one problem that did bother us it seems that some of the non stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking we thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 f was too high a temperature for the rack but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that i could find i m still giving this item a rating of four because it s just so incredibly cool an idea and so remarkably useful but i have to admit that i m not thrilled with the idea of a non stick coating that flakes and i wish the item was dishwasher safe i d love to see cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material	positive
put these next to the riedel glasses and they show very nicely considering they are half the price	positive
i thought this glass would be of better quality than it is it took 3 shipments \( re cieved and returned \) to get my complete order without any breakage these glasses are too fragile and in practice impractical because of the design one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass not too appealing when you are observing the legs of your wine recommend that you pass these by	negative
i spent about 20 minutes trying to ascertain how much this item cost but to no avail whatsoever i m so frustrated after such a lengthy yet futile search that i want to hurt someone instead i m shutting down my browser you idiots should think about how many more sales you d make if you just included a price for god s sake	negative

don t waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i couldn t return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	negative

i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and 1 they are too big and take up too much space and 2 the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3 the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better	negative
i have been using a chemex 10 cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee there is a downside to this coffee maker it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently the first time i tried to use mine i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever the big time consumers you have to boil your water separately \( you do have a water kettle right \) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex this means that while the coffee is brewing you are pouring or watching or giving the filter area a bit of a stir now the up side you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee i use filtered water freshly ground home roasted beans and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking and this coffee is a pleasure in fact i ve totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide another up side clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new try that with your electric drip machine ha that thing will never look brand new oh here s a final upside this chemex brews the best coffee you ll ever drink and it costs less than just about anything you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks go ahead and buy yourself one of these if necessary wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee better yet wake up 20 minutes earlier and when your coffee is ready instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes you deserve it update it s been a year now and i still love this chemex however over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use nothing i tried got it clean but something my wife tried did a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing now my chemex looks brand new	positive
i returned eureka 437az back to amazon i was very dissapointed when i ve tried to vacuum my room the vacuum is powerful but flow of air comming from the front blower is so strong that it disperses dust all over and prevents proper vacuuming in the cosumers report eureka 431 green vacuum cleaner is not recommended model and now i know that these two vacuums are practically identical the only difference being color and hepa filter another downside of this vacuum is that the dust acumulates over the filter which then is difficult to clean	negative

we had this less than 10 months and used only two of three ultimate filters we purchased separately that s how little use this pitcher got started leaking everywhere one day and i couldn t figure out what had happened i thought i hadn t put the innards back in right after changing the filter but in the end i decided either a seal or a seam failed i m not the first person to report the leaking problem with minimal use so i believe it is a design or manufacturing flaw what a waste of a good 60 with the additional three filters purchased while it worked we loved its sleek design how much water it held and how great the water tasted that s why it gets the two stars i gave it too bad it turned out to be a piece of junk i see the item is now not available here at amazon and i guess that means someone monitored the returns or complaints about the product and made changes or pulled the item from sales rotation what i want to know is when we will be notified by pur about the problem and given coupons or rebates because of it if you sent in your warranty card or registered the product online there is no reason pur couldn t offer somehting in exchange for their poorly designed item mine s now in the trash where it belongs don t buy one if you are considering it go with a good quality faucet mounted or under sink mount filtering system and you will be glad you did despite the more expensive price	negative
i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it it ticks but the bell doesn t ring at the end also i was disappointed in it s packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere	negative

this is a cute vacuum and that s about it the filter clogs and they are next to impossible to find the canister is a pain to empty the biggest problem i found was there was no height adjustment if you have thick carpet you just need to forget about this vacuum what a nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing mine has gone to goodwill	negative
my three cats adore this playpen just moments after putting it on the floor they started playing with the tease they also love snuggling in the bed together \( 2 cats fit at a time \) my only complaint is that i can t find the replacement teases they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non catnip styles the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i can t find them at petco s online store i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find	positive

this is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone i am not in the habit of writing reviews but this juicer earns it perhaps you are like me and have never used a juicer before you want to get one without taking out a small loan because you just don t know if your that into it if so this is your juicer there are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting i just want to back those up with my experience this is a good strong product	positive
i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best only problem is that they rust i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior i don t imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so but any serious tea drinker like me knows that s unrealistic i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn t last long at all i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i m officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot	negative

we purchased this purcolator christmas 2003 and ended up returning the first one after it did not work out of the box amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange the second percolator worked however i wished i d have saved my money the coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee don t take that last cup you will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating the percolator maintains the heat too high when ready and boils the coffee continuously mmmm burnt coffee	negative
i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6 10 times over the course of 13 months it stopped working i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it can t be repaired i should just throw it away i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless buy one at you own risk	negative
i recently purchased this set after spending several weeks trying to decide which set was right for me not a chef just a regular guy who likes to cook i looked at several competators and decided that for the price this set was the best one out there i ve had the opportunity to use most of the knives at this point and i find that they keep their edge very well and are extraordinarily easy to clean up they have a nice heft to them and the handles seem to be just the right size the only drawback that i see is that i would have preferred an 8 chefs knife instead of the 6 that comes with the set overall excellent for the price and an absolutely sufficient set for novice	positive

the amazon product picture makes these trays look like they produce square cubes and will therefore rest upon each other without spilling however the product one actually receives from bic superstore are trays that produce longer comma shaped ice and the trays themselves do not rest on each other at all the bottom of one tray freezes into the ice of the next so you get a frozen block of ice and trays all stuck to each other and impossible to crack apart without hot water these trays are a big mess they don t nest without spilling and don t be fooled by the and signs on the end of the trays no matter how you stack them they won t stack without spilling also bic doesn t share amazon s helpful return policy so buyer beware	negative
i see a lot of people have leaky shakers not me mine is absolutely perfect the top strainer piece fits snugly leak free requiring just the right amount of effort to de couple it from the canister the design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister the lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top the cap jigger also fits perfectly with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily	positive
for big birds rib roasts etc you need a long knife to get a clean even slice this knife delivers it has great lines and a ballanced feel the forged blade is thin and flexible yet still drives from the handle the blade follows your directions well and doesn t wander during a cut a real gem with top quality construction i m a big fan of three rivet durability but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that i chose them for the last three knives i purchased blade for blade these knives are the best around at this price you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years	positive
i purchased the eureka filter bags with the eureka upright boss 4870gz for my mom she loves them both the cord is really long on the vacuum which makes it easy to do several rooms at a time she lives in a one level ranch so she does not have to go up steps with it because she does find it a bit heavy beware the vacuum had to be assembled upon arrival i live out of state and she had to get another relative to help her assemble it the add never mentioned that small detail someone over 65 should not have to assemble a gift vacuum i bought the hoover wind tunnel 2 years ago for myself and it s a peice of garbage the lever to keep it upright broke the attachments fall off the hose when in use and everthing gets tangled on the roller i am thinking about purchasing the eureka soon for myself i reccomend it	positive

i bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels i thought it would be ergonomically advantageous which it may be but on the first pizza i cut \( on the mountain woods peel \) the edge is now folded over a bit rendering the edge much much less sharp than out of the box so i would suggest you save your 3 and the out sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while	negative
it seemed to work when i first got it but i m not really sure anymore when i first got it i changed the litter and put the smellkiller right near it usually after i change the litter i can still smell the litter it just smells clean this time i couldn t smell anything i keep the sponge moist and it still sits in the small area where the litter box is for the most part i don t notice any smells but i m not sure if that is due to the smellkiller or because i use a h baking soda kitty litter a 2nd litter with crystals and the a h litter box deodorizer powder i suppose it works ok but i wouldn t buy another one and i don t think it works the miracles claimed in other reviews also mine didn t stay on the wall either came crashing down only 1 day after i put it up now it just sits on top of the litter box	negative

i searched for months for a stylish durable set of flatware at a bargain price and this is it i was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a friday sale the design is unique and contemporary and the finish and weight are of excellent quality the only criticism that i have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher however this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come	positive

i bought this for my cat a few months ago because he just loves playing with a laser pointer the whole concept of this toy was great but they should ve expanded their ideas a bit more for the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does i m not sure about others but most cats i know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser maybe even jump up the wall as opposed to with the bada beam that just goes in a circle reversing its direction every once in awhile my cat never avoids the laser pointer when he sees that red light he jumps right up but with the bada beam he will just sit and stare at it the whole point is so that you don t have to hold it and let the cats go crazy nope it s one thing for me to be disappointed but it s clear that my cat was more disappointed	negative
this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well the fan is very quiet i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright too bright for a bedroom really lights it up i ll be looking for some way of safely masking it otherwise very nice but hope it lasts	positive

i ve own my x3 for about 2 years now and overall it has been used to make one double espresso daily so when it stopped working a month ago i was heartbroken called ff after some back and forth i sent the machine in for repair the cost of repairing it is about 200 incl the shipping add that to the 499 i paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine after several days of back and forth with customer service i still don t know what exactly is not working in my machine apparently there are 3 items that have failed one being the thermostat a washer and something else that cs was unable to explain i really liked the machine when it was working so i gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair but at the end decided against it i rather purchase a new rancilio silvia when i called the cs with me decision and asked them to send the machine back i was told that on top of the 12 shipping there will be a 13 handling charge for packaging the machine i refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty long story short i finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge but that was one very unpleasant experience it is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight i had with them i really liked the x3 when it was working and i would love to have it back but it is just not cost effective at all what is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance i provided it has 3 parts needing replacement if this was a good quality machine it should have worked a lot longer without any problems	negative

there is a clear echo here so to simply quote the experience of another reviewer after two months the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead rather than paying to ship the unit to krups myself clearly the company cannot afford to pay shipping on the thousands of these cheaply made units i hauled the krups fnp112 42 down to my workshop and found that the hose to the steamer had detached well fixing that problem did not render the fnp112 42 usable for now it simply exhaled steam in great plumes like a bull in a bugs bunny cartoon cleaning the unit per the directions from krups did nothing whatsoever nor did shaking it robustly or inserting various instruments into the nonworking nozzles serve any purpose but at least i felt a bit better turns out the only thing getting steamed was me i m going to buy a good espresso maker this year for christmas and i can promise you that it will not have the word krups emblazoned on it	negative

i own reidel as well as spieglau the differences are slight the spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft feel to them is very good and given the price if i break one i don t get upset as i would with a reidel no wonder reidel bought the company i recommend the spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive well made glass at a moderate price anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more as these do deserve to be recommended	positive

my husband bought this for me for christmas 2005 i was thrilled to get it since i had an older smaller model i had never burned any food in a slow cooker before i used this model i couldn t figure out how to get it to cook slowly i finally called customer service and was told i wasn t using the right kinds of recipes she told me that the pot had to be at least 75 full i used her advice but it still boils everything on every temperature level i use it to make roasts and that is all it sweats horribly and i have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn t burn my countertop the handle cracked after 6 months my biggest ah ha moment was when i came home after a long day out there had been a power surge and it had reset itself my whole meal was ruined and that is when i realized the value of a dial knob slow cooker just back away slowly from this one	negative
this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well but this one came out of the box warped the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy with only one strip through the center that made contact i could return it but for 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box i would never use it again	negative
we bought a well reviewed carpet vacuum from amazon last year and absolutely love it after that positive experience we were looking for something for our kitchen bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner starting with the dry vac part that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine but anything cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back which would be fine but if you lean it back too far there is a suction filter thing \( made for the wet vac part \) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue anyway the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well but if any of you have small children \( we have 3 boys under 6 \) don t have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes now onto the wet vac part which was the main reason we got this very disappointing we used the included cleaner warm tap water etc as the directions indicated and both my wife and i swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started it doesn t look cleaner shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean spills or stains that normally take 1 3 passes with a mop are taking 8 12 passes with this machine we bought this to save time and or get cleaner floors and i can honestly say that this machine did not do either as briefly noted above if you have children do not expect clean floors out of this and i can t recommend this at all this product may be suitable for people who have no children no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic i just know this isn t our house	negative

i was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price i was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion this set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand although this set comes with a sharpener i recommend getting the w sthof 2904 knife life knife and scissor sharpener you will not need to sharpen these knives much but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house i also recommend as others have to never place these knives in the dishwasher also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use this will drastically increase their longevity if you purchase these and i propose you do so then get a travel roll bag for knives this is because you will want to take them to friends and family s homes to show them off	positive

as a person who loathes cheap clutter infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would be returned the same day this opener is large requires an electric plug and takes up counter space but to my surprise it works amazingly well there is a foil cutter that is stored in the base the screw enters cleanly and seems to eliminate broken and shredded corks which can be frustrating hold the button again and the cork emerges from the device and drops out i always liked my sturdy and simple stainless steel opener but this turned out to be a keeper it s design is contemporary and clean although it looks like it should do something more profound than just pull a cork it s also a conversation piece provoking smiles from guests a pleasant surprise highly recommended and especially so for a person who lacks hand or wrist strength	positive

i was excited when i read the great reviews for this product but i was very dissapointed when i received it i wanted this because i live in an apartment complex where i have to carry my laundry some distance to the laundry room i thought it would be great to just be able to wheel it over with this however when i tried to put it together out of the box \( it requires complete assembly \) though it is simple to put together not one of the small screws that hold the top bars on to the unit fit all four will go half way in and no further perhaps i got a faulty unit but i see it falling apart soon because of this also the bag itself seems flimsy i was also happy when i read that this rolls quietly however they must have been rolling it on carpet because out on the concrete walkway that leads to the laundry room it is extemely noisy i ended up carrying anyway so as not to disturb my neighbors the only thing this unit has going for it is it looks nice and holds a surprisingly large amount of laundry if you are just using this in your home it might work well for you but if you need to take it out to a laundry facility go with something else	negative
the good \( function \) 1 \) rubber non slip base and good weighting 2 \) clear plastic allows full view of soap level 3 \) long spout allows easy access to sink no counter spills 4 \) smooth pumping action no clogs 5 \) pump goes all the way to the bottom sucks it all out 6 \) wide opening makes it easy to transfer soap from a large bottle the bad \( aesthetics \) 1 \) not beautiful \( not horribly ugly either \) 2 \) no choice of color would have preferred white to match kitchen appliances verdict function wins out over aesthetics highly recommended	positive

this blender died after 4 months of light use i never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous i only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half frozen berries after two months the motor started to have that burned smell when i used it after three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack at four months the motor started making funny noises it smelled terrible and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use all in all this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash i will never buy a hamilton beach product again	negative

just a word of advice if your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up if they aren t it probably is not the toy for your dog at first my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy it took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was his once i finally got him used to realizing it was his own he saw me put his kibble in it then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it granted the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy s value now it is something that can occupy him for 20 25 minutes he ll do anything for treats although i m not sure that he really really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears i think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats i like interactive toys \) on the other hand our little dog still doesn t know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy just a guess he probably never will figure it out so some dogs will take to it and others will look at you like you re crazy for giving them a toy that doesn t squeak	positive

i have several other pieces in this collection which i absolutely love when i was able to find the salad server set at amazon com for a cheaper price i couldn t wait to order it when it came i was more than disappointed the set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished \( which it is not supposed to ever do \) or someone had bought it tried to clean it with a polish \( again something that is not supposed to be done \) and it wore away the finish i also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set and when that came it was all scratched needless to say i returned both for a full refund immediately obviously the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case and it wasn t dirt cheap to begin with i still had paid 75 00 for it compared to 150 00 that it is sold in stores for	negative
although this item s description says it is made of commercial quality stainless steel it arrived with several rust spots so much for whatever commercial quality stainless steel means also be aware that the handles are not round but are u shaped it is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush on the positive side the locking mechanism seems to work well and i do like the non stick silicone tips however on the whole i would not recommend these locking tongs	negative

other than the look which has now been duplicate by other companies there is absolutely no reason to buy this incredibly expensive toaster it does not toast evenly it does not accomodate bagels unless you flatten the bagel into a pancake with a hole in it everything is manual and has to be reset every time including how long the toast cooks and whether you heat the elements for one slice or two the idea that the toaster keeps your toast warm after it s done toasting is false the toast is barely warm and as you d expect once you think about it dried out the dual lit is all hype no better functioning than a 30 toaster from sears \( or amazon which is the best place to do business in the world	negative

we now have the 4 2 gallon humidifer as well as the air softener all vornado and this one is most disappointing the construction is a bit flimsy but my biggest complaint is the area coverage the unit is supposed to support at least a 600 sq ft space we have it in our master bedroom which is smaller than this and the air still feels very dry in our bedroom even after we ve been running it for 2 days now non stop on the high setting granted i have a pretty heightened sensitivity to the moisture in the air in our bedroom given i have a cold and nasal congestion but i expected more from this unit given our satisfaction with the other we run the air softener on our 1st floor which covers several rooms and it definitely maintains a level of moisture there very well the 4 2 unit is in our basement which again covers several room and that one also has met our satisfaction we bought this because we needed one just for our master bedroom and we are pretty disappointed we have radiator heat and are suffering through the cold winter of chicago right now	negative
this item is not nine inches wide it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan but costs ten dollars more so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size hopefully the item description will be changed soon now i have to pack up and ship back several of these but at least amazon is paying the freight lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though i think this is just a random error just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7 99 the cornsticks will be the same size	negative

we had a rude awaking today our delonghi toaster was on fire i will never again buy any delonghi product the defective design is in the toast switch it is mechanical when it finishes toasting it sometimes continues to the always on position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast very very hot we literally had a house full of smoke a toaster full of flames you were warned funny thing is delonghi makes an attractive product sad thing is they can cost you your house or worse	negative

rarely does a product move me to write a review but i have found myself increasingly using the net \( and amazon \) to review products i am not really familiar with before buying them rice cookers were one of those products so i thought i d share my experience since i had a hard time finding a review for this rice cooker to help others out we were microwave rice and stovetop rice cookers until we started eating a lot of sushi then we wanted something to make the perfect rice this is it the first time we used it i let my girlfriend make the rice it boiled over and made a huge mess and came out totally mushy i was bummed i spent 200 on a rice cooker that was going to be messy or difficult to use then i watched my girlfriend making it the second time and realized she was putting in 2 times the amount of water required following the directions the 25 or 30 times we have used it since we get absolutely perfect rice white rice sticky rice whatever it is sylish so it doesn t look like a little crock pot sitting in my contemporary kitchen the cord retracts into the base for convenience and the thing couldn t be easier to clean the rice pot the lid and the steam vent pop out and are easily cleaned wipe the rest down with a damp paper towel and you re done so easy rarely is set it and forget it associated with perfection but in this case it is would i prefer if it was 100 150 sure but i paid 200 and don t regret it	positive

i am potty training my son so i needed a good waterproof mattress pad but didn t want to spend a lot of money this fits the bill it s lightweight but sturdy and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress and held up well in the wash so far has a nice feel and it doesn t seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do our mattress is old and thin by today s standards but the pad seems roomy enough that i think if we got a new thick mattress it would still work very pleased with this purchase	positive

this is a wonderful item that your cat will love i originally purchased a thermal mat from another website \( more expensive with a pattern that i didn t like \) my 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it so i did a search and when i found this one i ordered one for each of them this cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that i just ordered 3 more for my dad sister and a friend to give to their cats i ve seen similar thermal cat mats for 50 the pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux sheepskin my cats like both sides you can throw them in the washing machine and fur doesn t stick to the smooth patterned side which is nice of all of the cat beds i have purchased including a heated window mounted bed that plugged into the wall this mat is my kitties favorite thing to sleep on	positive
the english take their toast seriously and while i don t share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams sonoma for years about seven years ago when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound i bought the 2 2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about 100 less than the then going us price while it s a bit dicey fitting thick cut bagels into the slots \( not a big bread item in the uk \) i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them the toasting is even and i actually the enjoy the old fashioned timer without pop up which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled unlike others i do not unplug it after each use never had a problem the crumb tray is terrific and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess i ve had the 100 krups and cuisinart models which burned out within two years this one is made for restaurant use and i expect it to last a lifetime worth every penny if you appreciate high end kitchen appliances and tools	positive
i got the expensive one rather than the 14 99 aroma cooker thinking it will be better quality wrong i only used it twice not only the rice get burn after i clean in and out of the cooker it still look dirty the quality of the material was really bad i think the store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement do not waste your good earned money on this one	negative
after 3 1 2 years of pulling 4 to 8 shots of expresso per day and steaming hundreds of gallons of delicious foamy milk this little steam toy still works like new better than new actually because it has a better operator good results require a bit of experimentation with the variables of different grinds and quantities of coffee and durations of extraction i ve come home many times to discover that i d left the electric switch on all day but not to fear the thing doesn t burn up so far on other occasions i ve overloaded the pump by letting the reservoir run dry and then adding water to try to resume extraction through a filter that had become clogged from the interruption of the flow of water the pump keeps going even with the output blocked down to a trickle this will happen to you from time to time because you will neglect to refill the reservoir when it happens just start over with dry coffee you will also need to buy a small diameter tamper mine is 49mm the expresso liquor always has crema and never tastes sour to me even when using cheap brands of dark roast like eight o clock and community coffee everything i ve said about the brilliance of this machine is contingent howver on the coffee grinder without a good grinder you might as well just make drip coffee the secret good expresso in my experience is 25 expresso machine and 75 grinder a good grinder is the gaggia which i bought from amazon for 175 with a discount or the rancillio rocky which i would have gotten in the first place had i understood the importance of an excellent grinder this machine is small and light enough to take with you to the motel when you re on a road trip and cheap enough to leave behind if you forget to put it in your car the next morning my next expresso machine will be much more expensive but not because i m trying to obtain a higher quality brew my only reasons for paying more are to get double shots and the solenoid valve which will eliminate the spills of hot soupy grounds when emptying the porta filter also when you get familiar with the operation of a machine you d like it to last so you don t have to learn a new set of techniques	positive

this can opener is complete garbage other reviews have told the story about how this thing does not work i tried it three times each time with new batteries and it grunted to a stop after a millisecond had to battle with the thing all three times twisting and turning the stupid can opener to free it from its grasp on the side of the can the seam broke and leaked juice all over the counter the handy screw to back the can opener up was of very little use you are better off with a cheap electric can opener any time or a hand crank can opener with this device you might as well throw 20 bucks out on the lawn this piece of garbage ended up in the garbage completely worthless do not waste your money	negative
this perch is a great size for a large cat or even two cats together it is soft and appears to be very comfortable however the way it attaches is by affixing a strip of velcro to your window sill which then mates with the matching velcro on the bottom of the shelf unit there are two adjustable legs that are supposed to give support as they brace against the wall my window ledges are not very deep and so the shelf does not sit level the legs are adjusted to fit as closely to the wall as possible however mine do not move close enough in so that the legs stay securely on the wall and therefore do not support the shelf properly we have tried putting a piece of folded cardboard under the part that sits against the wall but this hasn t worked either so unless you have very deep window ledges this may not work for you we bought two of these but plan on returning one on a positive note my cats love the shelf and took to it right away it is a great idea but this one needs a little better design	negative
this krups toaster is the best i have ever used perfect toast every time the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife the defrost function works great if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices the crumb tray slides out easily eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster all in all the best toaster i have ever owned	positive

this product was much better than i expected i have owned a cuisinart hand held mixer for over 10 years and it recently gave up the ghost \( too many cookies \) so in searching for a replacement i tried a kitchenaid mixer instead what a disappointment it didn t have the power i had experienced with my 7 speed cuisinart i didn t want to spend more money on another 7 speed \( and i couldn t find one locally \) so i decided to try the 3 speed figuring i would have to settle for a degrading in power surprise surprise the 3 speed is just as good if not better than my previous 7 speed and less than half the price i would definitely recommend this mixer good product and i have always found cuisinart s customer service people to be helpful when i have had to call	positive
i bought one of these in august of this year i used it daily to make a ham egg cheese english muffin sandwich every morning with great results however after about a month the non stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan i called back to basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days the new pan has been in use for two months without issue the people at back to basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle some people reviewing this product have complained about the stainless steel water boiler becoming dirty from minerals and scalded meat juice others have complained about the egg being soaked in water from steaming and or sticking in the pan i have overcome these problems by doing the following i bought a gallon of distilled water that i use in the water compartment \( at an ounce or two per use a gallon will last a long time \) this prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum \( keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum therefore speeding cooking time \) every three or four uses i wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down after cooking everything i remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water then remove the egg with the plastic fork i use store brand spray oil and have never had an egg stick in the pan i have found that if i want toast an english muffin a bagel to be pretty crispy i have to run it for two toaster cycles all in all this is a great product butter consumption in my house has decreased dramatically and i m not making a huge buttery mess on the stove every morning plus there no dirty spatula and frying pan to deal with every day	positive

i m very happy with this mixer it arrived in pristine condition even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints i bought it mainly for bread making and after a certain amount of practice i m turning out great products i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard my only gripe is not with the machine but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured i got the hd i have researched as much as i can and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting but i just don t understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying seems kind of elementary to me	positive
i bought this unit because the humidity in my apartment on extremely dry days and nights was 15 20 the air o swiss 7135 was rated top by every web site i visisted and researced before buying this product it is also rated to work in rooms up to 600 square feet and the biggest room in my apartment is less than 500 well to summerize hygrostat consistently says 25 even though my bedside hygo says 15 the best i can get out of this machine is 30 humidity according to my own hygostat as the one built into the unit does not move past 25 the above situation is in the smallest room in my home which is 170 square feet so the 600 square feet rating is totally not true to close please be ware that this unit does not work for extremely dry apartments and homes like mine the other reviews must be in homes that are already at 30 40 humidity this is not worth the money you pay for it i will try running it non stop for a few days to see if it helps but if not then this unti will be going back	negative
i read the review for this product on amazon lindsey who is one of the 2 reviewers of this product actually had posted a video of the product usage and i was very much convinced by that i thought the product is good and ordered it immediately the product arrived in 4 5 days and was in good condition the most important problem with the roti maker is 1 the roti tortilla is not cooked properly it remains very much uncooked even though you see it puff and everything from the inside it remains uncooked which actually causes a lot of acidity problems 2 also such an uncooked tortilla when left for a few minutes becomes very dry and difficult to eat you have to eat the tortilla immediately within 10 15 minutes of the making just imagine if you are making 5 7 tortillas the first one will be come dry and difficult to chew 3 the product works as described but the tortillas are not at all good for health since they remain uncooked in the inside	negative

we love the omega paw litter boxes to death but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box our cats don t like the paw cleaning side they refused to walk on it so we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor we leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those but our new boxes are doing fine without them the cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves you might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws but don t buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it	negative

i don t know about the other reviews that say this knives aren t stainless steel the labels fall off or the filet knife breaks but what it s for sure in my case is that these knifes work great i don t go by fanciness nor brandy items i want knives that cut nice and easy and the miracle blade iii are the best it s true if you love your things just follow what says in the instructions manual don t dish wash your knives because in addition that they rust they start to reduce their original sharpness even more any knife will reduce their original sharpness no matter what the manufacturer says do not wash knives in the dishwasher or hand wash them with hot water all of my knives preserve their labels and looks like new and i use them on a daily basis once again it s a matter of following instructions my filet knife is in perfect condition common sense don t do everything what the infomercial shows don t bend the filet knife to verify that the guy on the infomercial s testimony is right this knife cuts beautifully without too much bending finally i own this set of knives for two years and a half and they still cut as good as the first day i received them by mail i live in colombia south america where this product is not too cheap so i had to think several times before i decided to make the call today after two years and a half i don t regret of making that call and i am very happy cooking with my miracle blade iii knife set furthermore i do recommend this knife set to anyone just follow instructions that s all	positive

have to disagree with the other reviewer here i purchased a baby biorb recently for my new betta after having my first betta living in an airless bowl for a couple years i simply got tired of cleaning a stinky bowl every week as a result i went shoppin for a new tank with a bubbler and filter system and found the baby biorb while i agree that the maintence costs are significant at 132 year \( if you need to change a filter every 4 weeks \) the costs balance with ease of maintenance personally my experience with cleaning the baby biorb was a snap with the optional suction hose took me fifteen minutes to clean the tank drain the grimey water and add new water couldn t have been much easier and i am not sure how anyone could have a problem swapping filter cartriges unless they have motor skills issues i also built a noise dampening box for the air pump my only real complaint is that the whisper quiet pump sounds like a mini jackhammer after about five minutes great product and looks awesome	positive

i did not like this product i m not aspiring to learn how to be a coffee expert i tried this out a few times it takes 5 mninutes or longer to boil the water its also a pain to clean and scrub this is a good option for people who want to learn how to make a perfect espresso a better option is to use the aeropress coffee and espresso maker it s real simple to use and worked beautifully the first time and tastes as good or beter than store bought espresso you can buy this on amazon put in the filter add some coffee add some hot water stir then press down in just a matter of seconds put this device over a coffee cup its real easy to clean	negative

the fan does work fairly well as an intake fan however in exhaust mode \( the mode i need \) i can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit it simply doesn t work as an exhaust fan therefore to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2 470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan i m returning it by the way the packing slip from air n water states that a 15 restocking fee that applies to all returns i am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with air n water if they try to hit me with a restocking fee	negative

this is a great maker for american coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso this will not pass for a full time espresso drinker the machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso	negative
i bought one of these for my girlfriend then read the reviews in my opinion it appears to work fairly well the sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage to the far left seems to work best for normal walking as i said in terms of accuracy i think it s pretty good the radio portion of the unit is reason for the 4 out of 5 stars the sound is tinny it s not stereo there s no frequency disply and the super mini plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones \( earbuds \) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size though overall when comparing price to features this little fella will probably suit your needs if you already have a walkman \( or don t care about audio \) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet	positive
sure it looks nice enough without anything on it but if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it pick something else it s tippy and it doesn t hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off it s cheap but you re getting less than what you pay for it couldn t last a winter when being used by only two people	negative
these rings are much too big and too lightly made for egg muffins and the eggs spill out the bottom of the rings total junk don t waste your money on these ring	negative
this fan is an excellent value for its price it gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds additionally it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level i bought this fan because my old one had died in the middle of a hot summer this one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room the only reason that i did not give this fan a rating of 5 is because it has begun to hesitate when it swings to the right this has happened to other similar fans i have had but not so soon after purchase if you re mechanical you can probably correct the problem by yourself i do recommend this fan for anyone and any place oh did i say the remote is perfect because i am handicapped it saves me from getting up and down too often	positive
this was my third foil cutter in one month the other two were flimsy but cost about the same they each broke in about two weeks i have had this one for five months and it isn t broken yet	positive
don t buy this fan unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed also if it has green lights \( like my blizzard fan did \) it will light up a dark room at night also you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling low speed is quiet enough for sleeping but high will disturb you the angle tilt adjustments are not precise and are difficult to do there are better choices	negative

i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it s extremely poor design mr coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers first of all the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless it s a filter it s supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly otherwise the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter clogging the drain and then voila you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty grainy water all over your counters i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234	negative
i baked six loaves in this machine i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don t turn out just right my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time \( 70 minutes \) my loaves were only marginally acceptable they were not sufficiently baked i was using a nearly whole wheat recipe the machine was quiet strong and had a lot of bells and whistles but with only partially baked bread i had to return it to amazon amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back and were quick enough with the refund	negative

until a week ago i d have given this coffee maker four stars because it has brew strength control last week though the clock face turned entirely black and this morning the unit completely malfunctioned the shut off alarm sounded after only an hour but when i went into the kitchen to salvage the last of the coffee i discovered the unit was still on draining the pot i attempted to shut the unit off manually and it kept coming back on i finally got it shut off and 10 minutes later it turned itself back on again after unplugging it the unit went into the trash i strongly suspect steam was able to get into the mechanism causing the electronics to short circuit obviously it is a fatal design flaw or a clever ploy to force people to buy more coffee makers in all it lasted about eight months	negative
i bought this set for three times for serving 12 people i also bought a lot of the additional to the set for my whole kitchen great investment i love the feel of these dishes very nice smooth feel but all the bowls look slightly different the slight inconsistancys make you feel like you have a set of hand made set	positive

i have some nice nonstick cookware that i needed whisks for so i got these my main reasons for choosing them were the brand and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone rather than silicone coated steel unfortunately that is not the case this is silicone coating metal this is acceptable though because the 5 year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off and 5 years of cookware safe whisking for this price is worth it to me the whisk is wonderful and i d recommend it to anyone just don t believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above	positive

i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best only problem is that they rust i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior i don t imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so but any serious tea drinker like me knows that s unrealistic i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn t last long at all i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i m officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot	negative
we have owned this machine for a little over two years for the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying however since then it has stopped drying such that 5 hours of drying \( yes 5 hours \) yields wet clothes this has persisted despite 4 repairs replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board which i assume is next prior to this machine we owned an equator brand washer dryer combo which was a disaster that broke after 3 years unfortunately the lg is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines \( equator asko maber and other brands \) available in the us all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115v the bosch combos available in europe but unfortunately not available in the us are 220v and thus dry more quickly this is not a machine for a family but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most when it worked it worked well however no one should invest 1300 to have it break in such a short time and no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry if you must purchase one of these machines \( for reasons of space \) buy an extended warranty	negative

i have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it it will overflow very frustrating as we like strong coffee because ours has overflowed so many times the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it won t hold water i ll never buy this frogware again	negative

like many people i have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on despite talking to the neighbor politely and such they still have no concern for the noise pollution i was losing sleep and the barking was getting so bad that i even considered moving in desperation we looked online for something to stop barking dogs we came across viatek s super bark stop and decided to risk the money wow talk about being worth the money my husband affixed the device on a piece of wood and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard it s unsightly yes but we re the only ones to really see it more importantly it s right in line with the barking mutt the first time he tested it he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin we laughed gleefully could a good night s sleep actually be on the horizon it s been several days and super bark stop has worked amazingly the dog will lie as far as it can away from the device when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor s yard if it starts to yelp a little it stops almost immediately it s as if it s afraid to bark yay you can select the volume tone and number of barks to help eliminate false activation \( say from talking or loud bird squawking \) audible and inaudible both work fine but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting the device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 d batteries \( not included \) to operate it i am so thankful we found super bark stop my nerves were really getting jangled and i was dreading early mornings when they put the mutt outside it s amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are just because you may want a dog doesn t mean i want saddled with its noise while you neglect it p s after using bark stop for 2 weeks \( yes it did work \) we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more \( not as bad as before though \) we had it on silent and realized that it had stopped working apparently it s not 100 waterproof despite the claims of the manufacturer the person i bought it from said that once it s opened we find that it s not 100 waterproof well guess what you gotta open it to put the batteries in it either buy a faux bird house to protect bark stop or house it where it won t get wet otherwise you may find yourself in the same position we were in we got a refund and fortunately for us our neighbors got rid of their dog so we didn t bother getting a new one	positive
after remodelling our kitchen i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out when i saw the picture of the towel holder i thought it unique with its scroll work and wouldn t look like everything else i saw when i received it the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible i tried with no luck to remove the stains the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt all in all i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	negative

i was very disappointed in this item i own the farberware 8 quart pot that this insert is supposed to fit inside but when i set the insert into the pot it didn t fit the insert handles which are plastic sit on the metal side of the 8 quart pot \( that can t be good \) and the little feet on the insert may or may not touch the bottom of the pot the ridge around the insert which i assumed would hold the insert in place in the 8 quart pot don t fit on any part of the farberware 8 quart pot has farberware changed the diameter of their classic 8 quart pot if i was trying to fit a non farberware item into my farberware pot i would have had no complaints but my 8 quart pot and the 8 quart insert were both farberware classic pieces believe it or not i had a cusinart pot which the insert fit i e the ridge held the insert in place so i ll use it with that pot but the insert sits some three inches above the bottom of the cuisinart pot so when i cook the boiling water seeps over very very disappointing if i d bought this item from a local store i would definitely have returned it	negative
while cute this little pan is difficult to use there s no room to use a spatula so you d better like the eggs cooked through you can t flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it s so small that it won t fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers	negative

the vacuum has great suction however suction is the only good quality about this vacuum i purchased this vacuum at sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale but i have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one the 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break the 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off this vacuum is hard to push you have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting on hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too this vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections the small compartment in the back of the dust cup is \( 1 high x 5 wide x 6 deep \) for the dirt the large front section collects the hair crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home however dirt and fine particulate dust is what i collect in my vacuum and hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter you spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet today i had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up i have tried kenmore eureka and fantom in the past i plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once i get my dyson i purchased from hsn	negative

i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer s comments mine too arrived broken sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces combined score 2	negative
yes it sits in my drawer and that s all it s only useful if you have a real dread of trace garlic aroma on your fingers instead i cut off the base of the garlic with a widish knife then put the flat side of the knife on the garlic and whack it with my fist it s so much quicker and easier the skin comes off no problem plus crushing garlic releases more flavour than merely slicing it	negative

we too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned we already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem now a month after using the new one its espresso pump is loud and noisy sounding like its broken also for some reason or another it won t send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso it ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out but then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine its been going for the last couple of days but its such a iffy thing on the plus side it does look nice and it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work my husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow but he says that about everything	negative

got one as a christmas present great concept but the performance falls well short of the promise as another reviewer noted wine from my wine fridge \( 56 deg \) registered as 74 deg when placed into the unit wine at room temp \( 72 deg \) regularly registered 78 deg or so although the unit ran through it s cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was in fact if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier i tried about half a dozen times over a couple days but it never worked properly we returned the unit to the store for credit	negative

i normally don t write reviews but after owning several toasters in the past and being very disappointed i just had to write about this one i owned an old toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years it never did brown evenly but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke got my money s worth i have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions amazon and others and many people haven t been very happy with toasters they have bought costing nearly 300 00 \( dualit \) toastmaster ge rival dualit most kitchenaid and sunbeam models were poorly rated i found one review on this sunbeam \( this is their top of the line model the chrome and black model costs more but currently not in production \) and the person really really liked it so i ordered this from amazon directly this was the very lowest price i could find order something else so as to get their free shipping \( over 25 00 \) so what happened when i got it got the toaster plugged it in dropped two slices of bread in and excitedly waited for my toast a few minutes passed then pop its done or so i thought when the toast came out it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted this goes for both slices right then and there i was ready to send this thing back well had been busy that week and continued using it day after day each day was as disappointing as the first then after a little over a week the bread started toasting uh well perfectly after owning this for nearly 4 months it still browns evenly on both sides of each piece of bread crisp on the outside soft on the inside i don t know why it started working right wouldn t think that it would need to be broken in to work right i am so glad that i didn t send this back right after the first several toastings procrastinating worked out in my best interest for the first time i have not tried bagels in this don t like bagels but it does well for what i bought it for i think the style is rather funky but many people have liked its looks if this toaster works for you as good as it has for me i think you will like it if it doesn t work well right out of the box you might give it a few days maybe the toast fairy will bless you too	positive

somehow i stumbled onto this item while searching for quiet and fan now that i review the item description i don t see any mention of quiet oops the fan s primary flaw is that it only has two speeds both of which are insanely high i don t need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over heated workspace a gentle breeze would be great instead i have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado on the bright side perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight and then one day frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan i can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window thereby cooling the office naturally everyone wins also while the fan looks identical to the holmes fan pictured it is branded as a westpointe really westpointe with two e s	negative
the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised it has three nested work bowls the inner smallest one takes a special blade \( a smaller version of the standard processor blade \) it s perfect for pulverizing mixing small quantities of things pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest 12 cup bowl a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box \( finally a way to keep everything together \) the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl it s the kind with the rotating hub \( two hub sizes are included one for lemons and a larger one for oranges etc \) while it seems to work it s not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black decker but what the heck it s worth trying the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it at first i was disappointed that there weren t any fancy front panel switch options but after thinking about it you only need the provided on off and pulse would i buy it again absolutely would i buy it again from amazon again absolutely the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised	positive
the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer s design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly	positive
back in the mid 1980 s i bought a patton 14 inch high velocity fan although this fan i am reviewing uses the same name it is not at all nearly as good as the original the original actually had three different speeds while this one uses three speeds they are hardly distinquishable from each other the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version the original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version oh yes the original s lowest speed was actually quiet whereas none of the speeds on this new version is quiet bad substitute and mediocre fan	negative
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products the enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently for this reason it is recommended to use on low to medium heat there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay otherwise cooking with high heat may cause food to stick discolor the enamel coating or cook the food unevenly remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide \( rust \) doesn t add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain it adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically this pan holds 5 1 4 quarts of food measures 9 3 4 x 14 x 3 inches internally and weighs 10 2 pounds 5 1 4 quarts will typically feed 8 10 people when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3 4 full any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac n cheese while not so desirable for other dishes add the le creuset 9 x 11 1 2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash lasagna scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials heck cast iron doesn t seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of pros extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10 2 pounds	positive

i had a small version of salad shooter it was great used it for so many years but now the blade was dull and i kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them i decided the next salad shooter i buy should be slightly larger so i bought this salad shooter professional series which is great having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day multiple cones to change large feeding place for the veggy fast light eassy to clean including in the dishwasher still small enough to store in small spaces efortless to cut and shread your veggy no need for knife and cutting board what i like the most about this product is the fact that when i put veggy in it to be cut shread the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut so i do not have to push it in probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades this way your work is done in no time in my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen	positive
i enjoyed this wholeheartedly mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula instead of mimicking the one time use of the flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around all the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable then every wrestler gets their own match some of which overlap which makes things interesting although we do see some perennial best of favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage who would have guessed sal bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000 s if wwe continues releases with rarer footage i think they ll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase	positive

my first viewing of this film was a great disappointment i expected another jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy film with chevalier substituting for eddy and i emphatically did not like the film then i viewed the film a second time this time with the play by play voice over analysis by miles kreuger which comes as a extra bonus on this dvd suddenly i was seeing the film in a completely different light and absolutely loving this film this dvd is an absolute gem and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by miles kreuger not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s it is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming \( because he s talked to those who were \) kreuger s commentary alone is worth the price of this dvd after seeing this film for the first time you must go back and see it again through miles kreuger s eyes	positive

melanie griffith rachel leigh cook and hugh dancy star in this straight to video film about one female transporter who gets into trouble because of someone plotting against her well that s all about it apparently but the film tries to give something unique to the otherwise unoriginal plot i mean the slightly original character of sarah by melanie griffth who plays that smuggler in trouble given a special job by malcom mcdowell with his customary i could be very baaaad smile sarah agrees to carry a pack hidden in her bag but as you know someone also wants that package and well that s nothing new but she is attacked on the way don t expect any thriller however the film s focus is not about that it is the relations about sarah and jack \( dancy \) who live together in a fancy paris apartment but while sarah is away from paris on business jack is attracted to a younger lady jenny \( cook \) who also falls for him thus the film makes an effort to include both love and crime nice try considering this interesting point about the character of elder lady sarah but if the factor is taken away from the film the end result is nothing but a flat tired suspence suspence as to its relations and its crimes alike either way the film is emotilnally very void ok two fatally bad things one too incredible characters see sarah is a professional courier who must know the rules of the job which could be dangerous but instead of renting a car \( and it s europe where that could be pretty easy \) she takes a train \( and a night train \) in which she becomes an easy target in this way the film misses every chance to make it more suspenceful when some character \( s \) must die they die like characters in old video games they fall that s all the other one acting let me be honest it was painful to watch the one dimentional performance of melanie griffith who was very good in another day in paradise maybe she is not the greatest actor but certainly she can act but as far as tempo is concerned no i don t think so only the location of paris saves this film from utter forgettableness forget about this one	negative
a star is born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons by failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star s tragic downfall the film displays a schizophrenic quality there is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen this is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors it s the nature of the material itself perhaps if we were to see the james mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living the audience would understand what the garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters instead we see garland s character despairing over a not very likeable washed up drunk and we re left feeling as empty as the film itself	negative

i m making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back the performances are thin and uneven the plot is inconsistent and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of friends to be fair this movie does face several major obstacles it has the misfortune to depend on the acting of glorified ken doll freddie prinze jr and the vastly overrated julia stiles and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges it also attempts to survive the intrusion of ashton kutcher it fails on all counts i do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre nor do i hate the teen movie sub genre under which some would place down to you \( in fact can t hardly wait is one of my favorite movies \) i simply hate bad movies and this movie is a true abomination if you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull then by all means buy this dvd if however you value your sanity then please do not make the same mistake i did stay far far away from this movie	negative
filmed at new york s improv in 1971 we see a young pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous more polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album craps after hours however witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother s prostitution then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said this scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come	positive

small town america only this isn t the pleasant and white picketed small town america of film noir fame it s the gray and colorless small town america of neo noir and there s the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it a bum who s being approached by that famous man in a black trenchcoat hard eight \( aka sydney but i ve yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title \) is a debut pretty much as promising as blood simple to the brothers coen paul thomas anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want \( or expect \) them to do but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout anderson also uses neo noir color to great effect allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir that said anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies and despite the long takes and steady cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies he focuses most of his time on the characters faces and just lets them be if he hadn t already done the amazing and always stunning later work of magnolia boogie nights and punch drunk love i d say that this is a promising debut that makes me impatient for the next anderson picture to come out but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt i must say see this to see anderson at his roots and man i can t wait for his next feature polarisdi	positive

this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it s a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one	positive
this movie is definitely one of the better thrillers to come out since it s release it s action packed and full of tension in it s 90 minutes of right on time kurt russell always good does a great job and this is no exception the late great j t walsh in one of his last performances plays one of the best bad guys i can t recommend this film enough for those seeking thrills action and suspense i can t really say what is wrong with the film but i just felt that it didn t belong in the perfect category although maybe it should because it does answer on every call a movie to watch again and again	positive
i can t wait to see the original film again i remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea thus was born the inspiration for the great pc game lemmings yes i know that the lemmings were manipulated into suicide nevertheless i love this movie i hope that they don t cut the lemming sequence disney has promised a full restoration other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an arctic blizzard the hardships of an arctic existence were beautifully photographed	positive

first of all let me tell you this is not a date movie this is the most brutal graphic rape movie i have ever seen and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over for me that s exactly what i want when i see a movie one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be i loved this movie because it is very very well made and the acting performances are incredible yes the rapes are unforgiving in every respect and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times this is not a gory movie except for the last ten minutes it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity however it really needs to the untold story and ebola syndrome offset much of the carnage with humor but red to kill has absolutely nothing to smile about it is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending the story is pretty simple a psycho rapist is on the loose and he s going after a mentally retarded young dancer in the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality her plan succeeds to a certain extent but not like she planned it and the rapist comes after her full force the actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational and i might add the musical score is perfect the music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts the actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing one of the best performances on film you will ever see to end this this is a must see movie for fans of this genre and i m just getting started myself not the gore associated with the two previous cat iii movies i watched but something even more terrible and unrelenting and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it red to kill is flatout a good movie even considering the subject matter i highly recommend it	positive
in this movie based on a true story we see jerry stahl played by ben stiller jerry is a geek hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing jerry has it all a hollywood mansion liz hurley a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some heroin jerry s heroin habit costs 6 000 a week but he is only earning 5000 \( \) per week one does not need a phd in advanced mathematics to realize this this spells trouble jerry eventually gets clean with the help of maria bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book one can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the drug scene i give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has maria bello in it although i still can t figure out why she finds jerry the geek so interesting his story is the same as any street junkie they all look the same to me when they are injecting heroin into their veins on the street	positive
there are some good things about this film it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the nazi propaganda machine was for one thing it also shows the main character antoine moreau a \( fictional \) famous french mime having his eyes opened to the reality of the nazis final solution to the jewish problem brought to a czech town that has been given to the jews by the nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the swiss red cross delegation hopefully persuading them that the germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed moreau changes his original idea for the performance hoping to get a silent message to the red cross that will let them know the true fate of jews \( and other undesirables \) at the hands of the nazis i ll briefly mention a couple of less than positive observations and then get into my main problem with the film the production values reminded me a bit of a made for tv movie and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture the image quality on the dvd could have been much better as well also the shanachie dvd release is version of the film that has been dubbed with english this is in the case of this film not very well done the cabaret singer for instance comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn t match her face or ethnicity in the least everyone in the film winds up with an english accent which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children stella \( portrayed by linda jablonska \) her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl she develops a bit of a crush on antoine which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show with her as one of the leads who is kind and supportive and friendly to her who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect the problem i had was with one scene in particular stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police she bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence in the process of getting away she gets muddy scrapes herself bloody in a few places and tears her clothing she goes to moreau s hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window when he opens it he is shocked at her condition lets her into the room and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes asking what had happened he then draws a bath for her so she can wash herself as moreau sits down still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her she steps into the bath just before she pulls her dress over her head she says to him no looking he shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says of course then repairs to the adjoining bedroom where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy a moment later he hears a noise and looks up to see stella emerge from the bathroom completely naked in a full frontal nude shot moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers suggesting that she warm herself she climbs into the bed he covers her up and steps away to the other side of the room there is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred he has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy this shot only lasts a few seconds but i feel that regardless of the director s reasoning for shooting it in the first place it could have been left out if the point was to show that moreau has either had morals all along or that he has acquired them it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways earlier in the film stella had witnessed one of her caregivers semi nude in moreau s hotel room \( stella saw this from outside \) given her schoolgirl crush on moreau it seemed natural for her to become upset over this as a result however the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour this combined with the adult voice dubbed over stella s makes the scene even more disquieting there are some viewers who might argue that in europe standards involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the us in many instances i would wholeheartedly agree with them there is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of american culture and moral values and not a little bit of neurosis however the sexual objectification of children is something about which i feel very strongly and i think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that don t get me wrong i m not so prudish that i turn away from even full frontal nudity in a film if it s not gratuitous and it s an integral part of the storyline but here it involves a prepubescent girl and could have easily been left out it worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can t recognize an instance where it s not only unnecessary but potentially harmful i m glad i ve seen the film and i d recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations as noted above with all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the holocaust never happened i think it s vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen the czech film all my loved ones is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves seek it out n b this is the second time i have posted this exact review i noticed today \( 6 april 2006 \) that it has for some reason been removed from the site i ve re read what i ve written and i don t see anything

many people criticized this movie for having no plot which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex there s just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain dougray scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of scottish actors john woo uses some wonderful australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes the gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow motion which robs them of any realism or hardcore seeing as how this is a pg 13 the action is also pretty damn tame which is a shame since woo is a pro at this you hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit it s all done off screen if people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire woo to direct it s a bit puzzling although it is tame it is still darker and harder than the original but the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap i can t believe robert towne had a hand in writing this it s like a rejected plot to a solid snake ps1 game there s seems to be some focus on making it a james bond die hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set pieces another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is zimmer s score for a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music but none of that is present in mi 2 this was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass produced soulless stuff which is also a shame it s the wrong plot the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots they really under estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one john woo s original cut was 3 5 hours long none of that footage is on this new special edition dvd what a waste	negative

for me this movie is very different than other holocaust movies in that it explores the issue of what happened to jewish spouses of aryan women the story itself is based on a true occurrence and the movie begins with a wake the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime berlin shows disapproval at her daughter s choice of a non jewish fiance the daughter then discovers there is more to her mother s past than she was ever told and travels to germany to discover her mother s past the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences and basically focusses on the plight of aryan women in berlin whose jewish husbands have been confined in a place called rosenstrasse i won t give too much away but i must say that for a slow paced movie it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the jewish spouses as for the acting the characters from the past did an excellent job their performances were very realistic and heart wrenching especially the actress who plays the main role of mrs fabian fischer the aryan wife in the present day the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother s past wasn t very convincing but all in all the story itself makes up for other lacks in the movie and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot	positive

this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film s mood i m not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition s music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition	negative

this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives not unlike our own but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity it avoids going too far into the subjective it doesn t try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute stagey displays of animal interaction instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments but by the sheer genious of editing and writing one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama the movie wisely lets the animals behavior do the talking and doesn t try to push the viewers judgement one way or the other it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals emotions and the nature of our \( and by our i mean all of god s creatures \) existence	positive

we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me it is one of the best films ever made now with red dragon i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is anthony hopkins the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter i don t think this movie would have been as good if hopkins wouldn t have played the role of lecter i own the original manhunter which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role this is a great thriller film edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham when a series of serial killing style murders start graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as the tooth fairy he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is like silence of the lambs we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence this movie holds true to the book with the same name we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s o t l without going further into all the details of the movie i ll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s o t l and the movie hannibal also ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon for anyone who hasn t seen this movie it s a must see	positive
1 2 when it was released in 1967 guess who s coming to dinner was acclaimed as a breakthrough film for its lighthearted yet serious depiction of an interracial romance in the years since society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so called mixed marriages that any remake is bound to feel at least to some extent superfluous and anachronistic and that is exactly the case with guess who a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the stanley kramer original the screenwriters first alteration involves switching the race roles so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in law rather than the other way around bernie mac assumes the spencer tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a caucasian boyfriend \( ashton kutcher as a white sidney poitier \) home to meet the family on the distaff side we have judith scott taking over for katherine hepburn as the understanding mother and zoe saldana replacing katherine houghton as the freethinking daughter since interracial marriage is no longer the hot button issue it once was the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non race related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama thus we have kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may in fact be the target of a securities and exchange commission probe indeed with kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father in law guess who feels more like a remake of meet the parents than of guess who s coming to dinner the real problem with guess who is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn t pass muster even on a third rate sitcom for every scene that is incisive and daring i e kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table there is another that is pure hollywood hokum \( mac and kutcher sleeping in the same bed together mac and kutcher having a go cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo etc \) all of the performers are fine especially mac and kutcher in the lead roles however they just haven t been given very sophisticated material to work with here guess who might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine hard edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality still it s been 38 years since guess who s coming to dinner first shocked the nation with its in your face defiance of miscegenation laws and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition which is why in the year 2005 brokeback mountain was a breakthrough film and guess who was not	negative
i would argue that since we really haven t evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out and despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace in mary harron s american psycho it comes out in all the wrong places the film is a character study of one patrick bateman \( christian bale \) a wall street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him it s not just the suits and the empty conversations either it is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card he tries to talk about his problems he really does but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period to their ears murders and executions is interchangeable with mergers and acquisitions the film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980 s this particular gordon gekko is overdone and overacted by christian bale in a great performance he is robotic phony arrogant and absurd he is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so \( all the while flexing his biceps \) more than anything he is militantly materialistic he is dexter mixed with jim profit only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co workers head the whole point which is made clear in the final scene is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts just because these people make enough cash to swim in scrooge mcduck style doesn t mean that their behavior is excusable harron paints the modern businessman as an american psycho and it is all too fitting to make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off you must be turned into patrick bateman the film is a great success as a horror movie villain patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever every scene has great energy to it and even though bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can t stop watching him there is something of a conflict presented when willem dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of patrick s murders that storyline is interesting while it lasts but it is never quite wrapped up i would also admit that after awhile i got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters he may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but i eventually did the character is endlessly fascinating \( what is up with his love of cheesy 80 s music \) and the scene where he kills paul allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized the male need for aggression isn t going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it otherwise we are going to have a lot more patrick bateman s and iraq wars on our hands 3	positive

a film that s a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism since nothing is as it seems we may as well be inside a fictionalized world like the unicorn story the main character cathryn is writing this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination however the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem \( hugh is played by rene rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn \) insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance	positive
i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash and godsford park and then stink up the joint with this what s up with that	negative

i really forgot how good some of those first season early episodes were until i bought the season 1 dvd skin deep is probably the most entertaining episode of the series other standouts are china doll and j digger doyle what i enjoyed most was the 1982 crossover episode as the featuring gerald mcraney and jamison parker from simon and simon from season 2 also the simon episode emeralds are a girls best friend and although not as big a fan of later seasons the 2 part season 5 opener w a young unknown sharon stone playing a psycho big surprise there i found it neat with the discoesque theme song for the first 10 episodes too you could see how the 4 main characters found their niche as the season progressed	positive

for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his her dirty secrets covered up i feel that it s the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government don t really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i can t fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i don t feel it s right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values his her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to his her mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it s alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who s rich do we wait until then to change the moral that s pathetic and so is this movie	negative
i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by living in oblivion the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener one of our most overlooked and under appreciated hollywood actresses she once again did not disappoint but the entire cast was extremely good you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason i m glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem	positive
i live in colorado one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand this movie is about a town called farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they \( literally \) wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods some live 20 to a house and have cars coming and going every day \( imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home \) the aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out in the open the video documents the two sides \( the ones who support and oppose \) the situation the side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their exasperation at their own city s inability to instill order and law as women who go to the neighborhood 7 11 are whistled at they become nervous \( as a women offered in the video unfortunetly it was not shown \) the thick misogyny in the mexican aliens was especially disturbing \( example a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her as in the mexican culture \) some create groups in support others create and claw for order eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement it is especially poignant to watch as this everday american women brings the situation to her counsil members they call her a rascist and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support it was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town i don t believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly they had every right to be exasperated our we not in a terror war since when does mexicos problems come before our own maybe because it was made by carlos sandaval it was more unobjective i felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing \( against illegal immigrants \) as mean rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws weren t being enforced when does the nations people not have a voice in their own country	negative

i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness but this movie is not in the same league first of all the plot is slow and boring bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move this really hampers the action aspects of the movie the dialogue aspect is not much better if you like bruce my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of jack of all trades episodes it is a lot more fun and has the real bruce	negative
this is an adorable movie it s low budget and the acting is not spectacular but nevertheless it s a cute story with sexy characters and an impressive unique plot conrad is a successful attractive man recently heart broken venturing into the unknown he hires a sex worker for the night as it turns out his hired man ian is quite the catch a young charming sexy australian trying to save money to stay in the country soon enough ian is in conrad s life every day though not as you may think as ian moves into conrad s social life everyone s issues come to the surface love stories unfold and redevelop problems at home collide with life at work the truth behind ian s need to do sex work comes out and everyone is in for a wake up call about life and what they need basically it s genuine it s cute and charming and it deals with real life problems most of which just happen to be gay a definite plus in my book so give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film well worth seeing	positive
those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been material for vh1 s the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple and when she does have more than 3 lines at once the complete lack of feeling expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang nails that is all i can say i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again	negative

i m not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre however most of the drills that i used with my team were effective this video is for the first or second year junior high coach \( like myself \) or any coach on the recreational level \( ie cyo and or pal coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter \) they are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough the narrator uses the expression dual purpose drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills for instance a drill with 3 players one shooter one rebounder and one passer a simple drill but after the shooter shoots he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot the timing is such that when he gets back to his spot the passer is already passing the ball thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when i tried it it worked great other drills also worked well like shots across the lane and a few of the rebounding drills the explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the x s and 0 s added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video the drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long the sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach the video could have been more detailed with more theory \( which i like \) but in truth it gives you just what it says some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy	positive

this thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours characters weren t given clear introductions or motivations they react in ways that don t make much sense and the accents come go and change into new accents altogether while the format reminds me of a primetime soap the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	negative
the military courtroom drama a few good men is one of those films that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it s own but even with countless viewings it retains it s emotional power and speaks to us about issues that have become more important than ever in the film we meet lt daniel kaffee \( tom cruise \) a young successful military lawyer who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases that supposably he s never even seen the inside of a courtroom he is assigned the cases of pfc louden downey \( james marshall \) and lance cpl harold dawson \( wolgang bodison \) they are accused of murder and a host of other charges when at the guantanamo bay military base they performed a code red \( an illegal form of discipline within a military unit \) on pvt william sandiago which unintentionally resulted in his death while the two accused marines admit they did the code red both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors which includes base commander col nathan jessup \( a brillaint jack nicholson \) a powerful highly decorated officer who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command with both time running out and a lack of legal evidence kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy through a brilliant script \( based on the play by aaron sorkin \) rob reiner s steady direction and the cast s dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as code honor discipline should a soldier always follow orders no matter what whats more important our ethics principles \( on which this country was founded \) or our need for security is col jessup right can we not handle the truth it s hard to believe that this film was made way back in 1992 in this post 9 11 post abu grebbe world where our country is on a war footing the questions that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever the film is filled with great performances while i am not normally a huge tom cruise fan i have to admit that cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer the same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from demi moore kevin bacon and kiefer sutherland but what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant dynamic performance that comes from jack nicholson when cruise puts nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on you just watch in awe as nicholson just continually builds the character s palpable anger until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous you can t handle the truth speech even though the speech and nicholson s performance has been endlessly quoated parodied when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance if you are interested in seeing a well made movie courtroom drama that is both thought provoking and entertaining then i highly recommend a few good men	positive

this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don t look now back in 73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	positive

i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i wasn t surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much once he did start playing gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in by the time things settle down the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface the mix is horrible the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the concert experience there are high points in the show but the low points are rock bottom comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart two versions are provided on this dvd from the concert and in the bonus section neither of the guest singers \( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff \) know the words have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience the very best thing on this dvd is oddly enough in the bonus section screamin jay hawkins i put a spell on you a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland almost makes the dvd worth buying almost watch jonathan demme s beautiful treatment of neil young heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show that is the gold standard	negative

this dvd is amazing perfectly puts the blues on display through the high points and the low points of the season the best thing about this dvd besides the flying is the respect they show the crew yeah the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff but they are faaaar from the stars of the show the maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide this dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do they truly go through the mill but they don t do a single thing with those blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly this is finally a dvd that shines the light on the pilots but makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots great job unlike the retired one who reviewed also \( great review by the way \) i would not like to be a pilot after seeing this i would rather get faaar more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it	positive

let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language	negative

i was just using this tape and ended it half way through to write a review the cueing stinks and is frustrating i am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using firm tapes on and off for about 15 years this one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is so frustrating you want a work out where you actually work not waste your time trying to read the instructor s mind and falling all over the bench	negative
i started watching it and couldn t stop i read the book a long time ago and i still think that s better but the movie is really good too highly recommended	positive

this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals so if you re in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view five on the black hand side and breathe in the culture	positive
an exact copy of ang lee s wonderful eat drink man woman frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i d already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i d seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you haven t seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	negative

this is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor it is also a story of cross cultural misunderstanding of the highest order kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part the scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema the cinematography and editing are a masterpiece unforgettable	positive
i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is what a waste of time maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in 1973 that time is past \( even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new \) now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated	negative
i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series	positive
this is a great movie and i got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much	positive
first let me say i love koyaanisqatsi the original film in this trilogy koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth the second film in the trilogy powaqqatsi wasn t as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war instead it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation nothing more if not for philip glass music i would not have given this film any rating at all i write this criticism in hopes that godfrey reggio sees it he should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us as clearly as he did with koy why war \( the topic of naq \) is so horrific if you want an effective critique of violence try clockwork orange naqoyqatsi is simply a mess	negative
the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not a 5 is because not everyone will be happy with all 5 films in this collection point blank is that this a must get you cannot beat the price for a good selection of quality american films very satisfied	positive
this effort shows it s age in addition there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo scientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele i suppose it s possible for it to be taken as tongue in cheek by those at the post graduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology however i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing	negative
i grew up with the original ds i also saw the two spin off movies house of dark shadows and night of dark shadows needless to say i was extremely excited about the revival and i wasn t disappointed i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera i looked forward to 3 30 every day after school it s too bad that the gulf war killed it yes it did i was there after the sunday monday miniseries that friday was to air the first episode however it was pre empted by coverage of the war too too bad i taped it but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over i am so glad to know that i can order it now in it s magical entirety i m ordering it right now thank you amazon if you are a fan of things that go bump in the night you will love this series	positive

director denzel washington cast denzel washington derek luke joy bryant salli richardson malcolm david kelley cody hodges leonard earl howze novella nelson running time 120 minutes rated pg 13 for violence language and mature thematic material involving child abuse based on a true story and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book antwone fisher is at heart a study of psychological disturbance laced with reasonable amounts of hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit it s a peculiarly american medicine swallowed less willingly in some markets than others which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused denzel washington s directorial talents \( which are generally good \) with the various workings of his film s plot which can be argued about antwone fisher s story starts in the navy where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate and is hauled up before the captain sent to navy psychiatrist jerome davenport \( washington \) he begins to work out issues of anger that it turns out stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend at the same time fisher \( played exceptionally well by newcomer derek luke \) struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting cheryl \( joy bryant \) in a parallel plot thread washington s character the ever reasonable dr davenport is having marital problems in due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and fisher is a catalyst for his own change fisher s screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience he was hired by a sony executive to write his own story a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft although washington s direction papers reasonably well over many cracks the most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character these include the psychiatrist s ironic domestic problems as well as fisher s tentative love life one is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt on elements leavening the appeal of a central harrowing personal history the fisher cheryl romance for instance while in context necessarily clumsy is also ultimately gauche and once consummated it is left to languish without further comment as if further exploration of this side to fisher s maturing was unnecessary perhaps sensing this central weakness fisher s script introduces another element into the young african american s tortured life as a foster child during flashbacks he has to deal with slave nation justifications from mrs tate \( novella nelson \) suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting significantly such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself and soon disappear from view on the plus side is the central performance by derek luke as the hero a perfectly judged acting job that neatly balances inner rage and confusion i don t know what to do with lack of self pity washington s role is also well done given the difficulty of the actor director role he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss either in front or behind the camera this is washington s directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing it s still a film that delivers all the emotional goods arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role despite its flaws antwone fisher is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged enigmatic individual it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn t have to endure such horrors	positive

how could mr cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody the production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos but the script and dialogue are so banal the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another \( including leo who was so good in what s eating gilbert grape in 1993 when i didn t yet know who he was i thought he was really a cute little retarded kid yet in titanic there s just nothing there or nothing permitted \) talk about a ship wreck only the two studio backed block voting resulted in the record tying oscar wins nominations	negative
even though amanda is quite attractive the camera work is bad the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga dvd a bitter disappointment there are few close ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window a bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better if you are looking for an accidentally soft focus dvd of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost this is for you	negative

the reviewer who called this a disney bait switch hit the nail right on the head i too remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid then later on disney channel and was awaiting these to be released on dvd as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together third rate offering i never cared for the elfego baca story i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the swamp fox episodes above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war who with his compatriots probably contributed as much as george washington thomas jefferson or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom i really loved this story just for itself not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set i have even gone as far as removing it from my wish list to save the funds of my family and friends as well i shall wait to see hopefully if disney will ever release the entire swamp fox story in a complete set for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price	negative

i was also disappointed with this dvd as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers i think the title yoga for beginners is misleading as this dvd contains many advanced yoga routines also on the back of the dvd it said it contained a core workout 20 min but no such workout is actually on the dvd i purchase the pilates for inflexible people at the same time as this dvd and i much prefer it although i wish i d known that two of the workouts from the pilates dvd were on the yoga dvd before i bought them both	negative
pick any house on any street pick any random two people \( man and woman \) give them a script and let them go wild i promise you could make this movie work better than the producers nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring the acting and settings in this movie are just horrible by the end you want everyone to die just to become interested now i don t usually give bad ratings and i really like b horror films but the lack of effort here is unbelievable just nothing to interest me	negative

what is it with the british film scene and its distinctly gritty style it seems that if we re not producing trashy ealing comedies it s a shocking reality drama with the likes of ray winstone in it well ray winstone isn t in this one but he could well be as the rat catcher is another one of those you either enjoy challenging films or you don t pieces i personally love them i guess i must be a miserable bugger of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate but it is unique \( well probably not unique \) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy played by william eadie who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him we learn that no matter what environment children grow up in they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow without wishing to give too much away it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since i watched it in 2000 worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things	positive
this movie has a lot of meaning behind it the actors put on a really good show movie is lacking special effects but that does not hurt the quality in any way story keeps on unfolding in unexpected ways	positive

die hard fans of writer director david cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in this sci fi horror tale that accounts for so many 5 star ratings by other reviewers that was not my reaction to this film it was slow uninteresting and the ending was a disappointment i give it only 2 stars the characters stumble through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are gamers duh cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles william defoe is completely miscast as a gas station attendant jennifer jason leigh s wardrobe looks like retro 1980 s jude law does well except for a couple of unexplained accent changes beware of the tag line that says existenz makes the matrix look like child s play this film is no where near the caliber of the matrix if you are not a cronenberg fan i recommend that you pass on this dull film	negative
the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people i d say that about half of them get shot in this movie usually when a movie runs over 2 hours it s because there s a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in in the case of hard boiled the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo s desire to get into the guinness book of records for most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture chow yun fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff he shoots \( usually with a pistol in each hand \) while diving headlong over furniture while swinging from a rope while sliding down a banister \( \) while being hurled through the air by explosions sometimes he even shoots while standing still and he shoots and shoots and shoots and the bad guys shoot and shoot and shoot and yun fat s fellow cops shoot and shoot and you get the idea there are some fine action scenes in this film but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended there wasn t enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine gunned from the next and it became painfully repetitious personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled there s plenty of yun fat s balletic shoot em up action but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire	negative
perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln s various works such as the sacred place the messianic legacy and holy blood holy grail or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books however it is simply not successful as a stand alone video or as a video about the da vinci code the narrator mr lincoln takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the languedoc home to the cathar heresy and the albigensian crusade and points out some interesting details in his wandering yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture as well he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals \( many inspired it would seem by lincoln s books \) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions i finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark i cannot imagine what else mr lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour	negative

if there s a worse movie than this i haven t seen it looks like it was made in a day the quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits sort of like it was copied from a vhs tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6 000 times the actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad twilight zone episode if you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes the musical performances are obscure little known doo wop flops \( except for frankie lymon \) look i wasted 14 99 plus tax plus gas to run out and buy this bomb the only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in swedish send it to a greenwich village art house and pass it off as a foreign film come to think of it don t bother to dub it the sound is so off it looks dubbed already important update please read this i later discovered after i wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50 s i understand that it is used constantly at the international institute for sleep disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi comcious near sleep state for incurable insomniacs and so as i write this update i ve been watching the flick again and i must admit i \( yawn \) oh excuse me where was i oh yes i must admit that i \( bigger yawn \) oh my goodness i m so sorry this is so rude of me \( yawn \) but it seems like \( snoring \) i \( snoring \) i just can t seem to \( intense snoring \)	negative
my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school it wasn t until years later that i saw it and i was horrified this was a movie aimed at children what does a children s movie need a sexy bunny for the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and strutting her stuff on the basketball court in a very provocative manner until the male characters were panting drooling and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick depraved perverts this scene was highly innapropriate for children and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls not only that the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities this movie should be kept far far away from children and was truly deserving of zero stars	negative
the strange and baffling career of cuba gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of denzel s training day unfortunately cuba s not denzel and this movie is way below the quality of day filled with enough foul language to fill the pacific ocean the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie filled with bad cops where s the good ones clifton collins jr so good in capote is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of cuba who is going to testify in internal affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust all though this cuba swaggers like a rap star and collins has to try and act tough with him there s an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film	negative
better than submerged but that s not saying much my wife and i have seen almost all of stevies movies and next to the foreigner and submerged this movie ranks up there in the horrid category what is up with the voice dubbed over when stevie was mumbling we kept trying to guess whose voice that was \( burgess meredith the guy who played the other terminator on t2 etc \) that was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film i can t see why blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe maybe there are more of us die hard ss fans than i realized even so save your money do not buy rent steal vie	negative

i had heard about this flick being talked about as the chinese charlie s angels it took me a while but i finally popped it in wow this has to be on of the coolest movies i have seen in a while i was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why i liked it so much the story is about these 2 women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living sweet i am not going to lie i wasn t paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever all of these girls know martial arts or at least they can put their legs up really high and director corey yuen puts in some of the best wirework i have seen this movie certainly isn t going to win any awards for it s high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that i wish i could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot posters so on top of this being an amazingly fun movie yasuaki kurata shows up for the finale corey yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie if you have seen some of coery s 80 s stuff like yes madam or even the newer fong sai yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema \( example ninja in the dragon s den \) kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever legend of a fighter which was made in 1981 well at 56 years old he looks just as good i was so amazed by this movie i have watched it 3 nights in a row and i will continue this routine for a while \) the picture quality on the columbia tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles also good 5 1 sound cantonese track the original mandarin track and a horrible english dub	positive
sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie but peter sellers did many better films than this dr strangelove was the masterpiece being there is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington the world of henry orient \( at last on dvd \) is priceless but virtually unknown with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors finally the pink panther series is much better slapstick than after the fox which has many famous talented participants but is mostly silly unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau co one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations as if we might not notice them otherwise i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted and martin balsam does okay with his stuff too when watching this film i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money	negative
this movie is typical hollywood anti war anti military anti american trash the show biz liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the left wing tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as baby killing drug crazed monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers a much better and far more honest film	negative

patton oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance it s because of comedy central mangling the dvd version the show was originally broadcast on comedy central and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one hour time slot with commercials the dvd has the original show and then in the bonus section it has deleted scenes which are the parts of the full length concert that were cut for time so you can watch the time edited show or you can watch the out of context segments that were taken out but what you can t do and what i have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do is see the original full length show in its entirety so cheers for patton boos for cc i won t be buying the dvd and that s why	negative

this dvd was the first one released by michael buble and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances there are segments of performances but the editing and fast wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect the performances get largely lost what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking clubbing gambling womanizing and generally acting like rowdy frat boys if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like i highly recommend caught in the act this dvd lives up to it s name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster caught in the act is slick glossy flashy enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience i ve seen buble perform live twice and i can attest that caught in the act is just about as good as being there	negative

denzel washington is probably my favorite actor even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate he shone tom hanks well lemme quit hating the guy this is a well intentioned movie tom did a creditable job and we had extreme close ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy a passionate one though since he s still a latino after all actually this is a hollywood message movie and you know what that means it s about as subtle as michael moore those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie those who don t agree with the message stay as far away from it as possible there s a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy the way they stared at him reminded me of lao wei in china experiences denzel s character was reminded of segregation even though he s too young to remember it and started to care about tom hanks character aids discrimination is bad actually any discrimination at all is bad and that s the movie s message i agree with the message but still that s all we ve got as a totally irrelevant non sequiter if the name sam francisco means anything to you you ve seen subtle commentary on discrimination i love a great courtroom drama this one was merely good with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two hour film they had to take a few shortcuts here sad ain t it but even so a well intentioned film that i m glad i saw once not twice once is enough thank you	negative
i have never understood why people find this to be the pinnacle of british comedy once you get past the numerous jokes about mrs slocum s cat and a flaming mr humphreys you have very little left to justify it s long run except that it was probably the right show in the right place at the right time in retrospect it is lacking many will disagree with me but that s life	negative
a pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family you can count on me tells the story of sammy \( laura linney \) and terry prescott \( mark ruffalo \) siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young years later and sammy is a single mother of 8 year old rudy \( rory culkin \) she works hard at her job at the bank now run by over critical brain everett \( matthew broderick \) and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is \( josh lucas has a great cameo as rudy senior \) when terry shows up after months of no communication sammy is immediately thrilled but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw up and is just using her again terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend s abortion but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with sammy and rudy over the course of a few weeks terry has made a deep impact especially in the life of young rudy who idolizes him this film follows the changes each of these siblings make changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make it s a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it shouldn t be missed the performances by the two leads are outstanding and young rory culkin is adorable and mature as sammy s son but the real shock to me was matthew broderick who played the demanding philandering unlikable type brilliantly and he s not one i m generally impressed with	positive
very short game took about 2 hours to finish it \( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it because as always their system is unavailable please try again later took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy \) as to the game you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary gameplay was average for a shooter it seems episodes basically translates to really short game which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something	negative
these are great films and the set is lovely but boo to criterion anyhow for not sticking up for cassavetes scholar ray carney whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with cassavetes widow gena rowlands buy the dvd set anyhow you must but go to the cassavetes pages find carney s links and read his account of the troubles he s had trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of faces and shadows he himself tracked down sorry to take sides gena rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does but i greatly admire carney s contributions to keeping cassavetes memory alive and exposing people to his films he put an amazing amount of work into cassavetes on cassavetes too it sucks that he kind of got stiffed here	negative
i m not a big fan of bruce campell but i was appalled while viewing this film i know it s a b horror film but there was no orginality in this movie i know it s suppose to be funny but come on people was it really the only part that was slightly funny was when campell s wife was going after the gypsy for the first time needless to say i think it s interesting that this movie was a book going off subject however on a late night talk show bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a pg 13 horror film i ll conform with that	negative

dont take me wrong i do love mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me i mean mariah doesnt seem very interest to play in this movie this movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed come on but then mariah seem to be better in another movie called wisegirls but again i honestly dont think that mariah should be an actress herself i mean i think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the attention and show off like saying in her mind look at me i am in the movie i honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her work with her actions in the movies not like this and wisegirls movies i feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but i had to say what s my opinion about this movie anyways wisegirls was alittle better than this one	negative
i can t believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd take advantage of the low price and buy this now i m no expert on the hot rod scene but this was very enjoyable the footage of pinstripe artist skratch is worth the price alone i would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this you get to see the creative process of some great project cars as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members i will definitely be watching this one a few times	positive
what a mind numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror comedy of all time the re animator continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re animator series for his own and to convince us that he can direct producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite beyond re animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna directed bride of re animator that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story as with dagon yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film unfortunately the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast this is a story set in massachusetts for crying out loud why would the warden of the prison the reporter coming to cover the story the guards and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents it wouldn t be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act but they can t simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast but their acting is so bad and their adr afflicted lines so glaringly off that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes \( witness the gratuitous nurse nipple scene in this film or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re animator \) and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry based on yuzna s shoddy history with actors one might be tempted to blame it on the director but the fact is that in this film jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment basic elementary acting his every internal and external beat rings false his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre most high school students do better than this jeffrey combs as herbert west seasoned pro that he is gamely plays along but the script puts west s character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit inducing pataky andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film on a strictly technical level the cinematography looks good the score is all right \( though often too serious minded for its own good \) and the film doesn t look low budget but when the story is such a mess and the actors so inept no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film yuzna really should stick with producing because on the stuart gordon directed dagon at least there were some good moments but beyond re animator is beyond salvaging possibly the worst film sequel i ve ever seen and way up there in the list of worst films i ve ever subjected myself to	negative
i won t go into the movie itself as other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that suffice to say that i have always enjoyed cloak dagger despite the hokiness of some of the scenes \( not to mention the laughable visuals at the end \) this movie still rates at least 4 stars from me however amazon reviews are supposed to cover the entire product and not just the movie itself in two words it stinks no trailer no subtitles no scene selections no extras of any kind not even a menu when you slide the disc in the movie starts right up when the movie finishes it starts over again if you press the menu button on your remote nothing happens personally i d prefer it if after the movie finished playback would stop and you d go to a scene selection menu even a still image telling you the movie was over would be better than playback looping back forever i suppose i should be glad universal even bothered to release this movie on dvd it s just disappointing that they obviously didn t put any thought or effort into it	negative
truth be told i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively when this thing gets going though the descent easily attains not to be missed status and on top of all the incredible special effects oppressive atmosphere and grievous bloodletting \( made with a pretty limited budget by the way \) one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner are you kidding me blood gore a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn t believe and subtlety how could i not give the descent five stars so you ve got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky extreme activity white water rafting for example everyone has fun but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women sarah \( shauna macdonald \) forever still recovering from her terrible loss sarah joins her friend beth \( alex reid \) in america where mutual friend juno \( natalie mendoza \) an alpha female if there ever was one has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored joining in the fun are holly \( nora jane noone \) juno s new gung ho sidekick and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians \( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk \) then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure once they descend into the cave system though things start getting more intense fairly quickly their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses that s when juno a woman with more than her fair share of secrets admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before supposedly to help reunite the group well it does just the opposite but they just have to keep going if there is a way out they re going to have to find it the hard way things are already creepy enough at this point the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets making the viewer feel as if he she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic but the real fun was just about to begin in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you ll ever want to squirm through sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them no one believes her at first when the crawlers attack though all hell breaks loose two miles under ground these gollum like creatures are some kind of blind albino humanoids who hunt by sound can scamper and climb like monkeys move unbelievably quickly and really tear into whatever flesh they can find not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light and when the girls fight back it s cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy bloody gruesome department and even as characters are fighting for their lives a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences didn t get to see the true final scene of the film for some pretty questionable reasons a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference don t worry though as the dvd has both endings available the descent draws deeply from the well of man s most instinctual fears making it one of the most atmospheric heart pounding movies to come along in quite a while the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film and plenty more on top of that if you care the first thing about horror you must see this atmospheric tour de force	positive

this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices he hit the time the place and the kids perfectly this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday its a great movie and i d recommend it to anyone you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn t as bad as it sounds plus great script dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950 s over this era	positive

uhmm yah this is a low budget film but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck i ve seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art it s impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing sideline secrets for even untrained actors this is bad it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn t supposed to be someone in the backgroung i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom a garage into what was supposed to be a club and at the end of the home movie i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive \( quite so too \) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever so hard to be a soft core porn thriller in all seriousness this thing gave me a horrible migraine if you are stupid enough to actually buy this \( thankfully my roommate rented it \) invest in either a bottle of advil or a sledge hammer you ll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins	negative
this would be a steal at twice the price i don t know what possessed spike lee to offer five of his best movies at such a low price do the right thing is a brilliant movie capturing both the rhythms and tensions of lee s beloved brooklyn which he would return to time and again lee is at his best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character driven movies jungle fever and mo better blues stand out in this regard because they are first and foremost about people jungle fever introduced the great samuel l jackson as well as launched wesley snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an inter racial love affair jackson stole most of the scenes however as the drug addled brother who simply couldn t get his act straight no matter how hard he tried mo better blues exposed lee s love for jazz moody and atmospheric with denzel washington delivering a solid performance the film tries to recapture the spirit of the harlem renaissance clockers was his crime drama with plenty of tension crooklyn revolved mostly around amusing family disputes with alfre woodard as a strong mother figure it was probably the least satisfying of the five but fun to watch just the same lee embelishes his movies with such rich cinematic color and offers numerous fascinating camera angles such as his now famous walking scenes in jungle fever not since gordon parks had someone done so much for black cinema rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70 s	positive
this movie is just terrible even more than most of the predictably terrible films in this genre women with terrible haircuts dirty homes filled with poor taste in furniture jobs a 16 year old would have or no jobs at all awkward behavior barely able to function socially uh gh the truth is there are gay women out there who look great have beautiful homes have very progressive and meaningful careers have talent and are entertaining and sexy who says this is representative not in my world it isn t i am so sick of these painful displays of us anyone who gave it over 2 stars is childishly defending the genre in general and not talking about this stinker of a film the filming is poor the sound is dull don t waste your time	negative
i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you re thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate \( which is why i gave it 1 star instead of 0 \) however if you re still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it	negative
i am not a spring chicken so i get introduced to anime through my daughter some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day full metal is none of these the characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor ed and al are young boys their mother dies they desparately want her back they do something forbidden they pay and they learn what the costs are the world is a confusing place they navigate sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way not everyone is who they seem at the start finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules through the story there is humor and growth the story is told from their point of view they do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other i highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies \( that s me \) much better than most things available for teens these days i rank this up with dante and faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives	positive
this is one of the great biopic films ever made more often than not film biopics are too rushed they try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives this is not one of those films it just covers woody guthrie s adult life from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer and his passionate defense of the working man the look of the film is deliberate in that it s washed out the hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film they re really lively where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves the film has a real genuine feel to it like you re actually watching real people david carradine is amazing as woody guthrie he makes you think you re actually watching woody himself he did his own singing and stuntwork on the film ronny cox is excellent as well and he does his own singing too \( remember cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in deliverance \) randy quaid and melinda dillon offer great supporting roles as well this is a fabulous film and it feels short at 2 1 2 hours	positive
this is a wonderful show and very true to the band s recent live performances albeit with a condensed songlist i give it only 4 stars because i had the pleasure of seeing mr winwood and band live and the sound stage gig seems just a tad below that experience which is admittedly an unfair comparison nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso \( actually a band of virtuosos \) consider it 4 5	positive
where to begin cliched pretentious flat static maudlin melodramatic homophobic and finally just plain boring start with an over the top caricature of a deaf mute patsy cline young drag queen arriving the big city pile on cardboard colorful characters like typical aids patient porno star and loud mouthed latina hot mamna and whaddya get an amateur film populated with some of the most unlikable unattractive characters ever all spewing some of the unbelievably bad dialogue ever written and to think the \( formerly talented \) director made the whole wide world also with d onofrio go figure nice cover art though	negative

this is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl it is better than the average for this genre due to several factors mostly it is because is well done the subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here instead the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy the time of the film is the 50s society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will in this case the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen he is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on the nice girl meanwhile the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek the geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits the loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special the unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch everyone winds up happy except the town bully rich boy it is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that kelly preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off doug mckeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself catherine mary stewart is the nice girl that i wish had lived next door to me and jami gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle the cast is rounded out by chris nash each does a good job in the role teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results it was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured	positive

the movie is one of my favorites works on both a romantic level and a comic level but where s the widescreen todays consumers are more educated \( thank god \) and they ve almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen you lose the top and bottom of the movie they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd it is for all intents and purposes incomplete who s going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible	negative
i stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago having nothing better to do i watched it my first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens i was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot you don t have to be stoned or even a stoner to enjoy this movie one reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film like your actualy there scrapping through life with the characters i guess i can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie not enough bells and whisels but if your up for something differnt give it a try by the way the movie was based on a book of the same name also very good and differnt	positive
this is an amazing dvd i read reviews online all the time saying anyone will like this but seriously i even showed it to my mother who laughed that s a big deal this dvd follows these four comedians on their two week tour their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city also throughout the episodes it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in america during her time of need interpersonal relationships and anything else they could think of this dvd makes me laugh to tears every time literally	positive

i am a sci fi space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley the cast was solid the director has talent and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well right nope this was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense the formula kept repeating over and over something goes wrong houston advises astronauts do something all is well lather rinse repeat boring very boring i never once flet any real tension except for the initial problem which obviously was not that bad because everything went well in the end the problem is that all of the issues the men faced were handled so matter of factly rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked it was just yeah attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be ok i never felt that the astronauts were really threatened maybe a few times but only for a minute or two some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting how so i must ask nothing really happened it was not emotional at all since the struggles of the men were so poorly portrayed to each his own i guess but 4 1 2 stars geeez just because tom hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks the family interactions were pretty standard crying wife kids asking questions annoying media attention etc etc yeah i could feel for the characters to some extent but again this movie needed a lot more real tension and panic to be meaningful i will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and star trekkish special effects too bad i had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored not recommended	negative

the only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it the writing was terrible the plot so unrealistic and the special effects horrible this is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made why haley mills agreed to star in it is beyond me	negative
this is an imaginative take on the jack and the beanstalk story while it was apparently made for kids the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested \( i m 19 \) plus as a female i appreciate the fact that it s one of the few stories where \( possible spoiler \) the damsel \( who s in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women \) rescues prince charming well acted it features some great chemistry between sara and modine but i still can t give it 5 stars here s why \( spoilers ahead \) 1 i m no math person but why couldn t the writers be consistent with when jack s dad died one minute they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when jack was 14 since jack is 37 it shows that the writers can t do simple addition couldn t they just take two seconds to do the math 2 how the hell does siggy know about goose and harp i got the impression from wilhemina that jack s dad didn t believe the story of the original jack but apparently jack s dad told siggy not to tell him about the family s dark secret until he was ready i wish there was a more believable explanation for siggy knowing a lot more than he should 3 if siggy is smart enough to know the all the robinson secrets i think he should be able to catch on to the fact that jack is in love with ondine fairly quickly i always wondered why he didn t try to kill ondine when he was so against jack having an heir i understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones don t get me wrong i don t want ondine to die i wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and jack but shooting her \( or at least threatening her \) would have been a great way to kick up the tension suspense 4 siggy s accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that completely fell flat it was not funny and was a bit gratuitous but if you re a fan of romance adventure or just feel good movies in general those things shouldn t keep you from enjoying this film don t think too much about the plot holes you ll go insane if you do	positive
i really loved this dvd there is some information for everybody beginners as well as advanced there is also a nice presence from paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album i was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing this dvd without being too personnal made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man i also enjoyed the discovery of the south african music their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country the many footages of the countryside were a pleasure which worked perfectly with graceland songs the anecdotes are meaningful witty funny deep depending on the situation none of them self indulgent or egotistical this dvd is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer s i would rank this dvd up there with the clash west way to the world and u2 the making of the joshua tree	positive
i was stunned by this movie i learned of it and purchased it in 2003 for various reasons it remains for me the best most emotional movie i have seen about musicians and their music the producer chose well he found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years townes van zandt rodney crowell steve earle guy clark steve young john hiatt charlie daniels and a tribute to the late skinny dennis immortalized in guy clark s la freeway i wish david allen coe had been left out but no film is perfect the songwriters are shown at their best and worst a drunken funny tvz falls into a rabbit hole and silent night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics this movie was made when i was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in tampa at the university of south florida the difference is that most of my friends and i got straight jobs we still tried to make a difference but these musicians changed the world just a little i married the singer business major i met at usf and divorced 30 years later i still play guitar write and record at home and dream of making it in music but mostly i learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me when tvz sang waiting around to die he brought tears to the eyes of his 70 blacksmith neighbor while cindy comforts him it was magical tvz does a medley of my hit and sings pancho and lefty and rodney crowell sang bluebird wine both covered by emmylou steve young s alabama highways was wonderful too it was a look into my past and the past and future of the intelligent emotional music i love best	positive

one only needs to watch ball of fire to realize the depth of barbara stanwyck s incredible talent i d match her up against any actress of her era or any other era here is a woman who can rip your heart out even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi dimensions of her characters sugarpuss o shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive good looking gentleman but she also shows her love to the other professors 1941 was stanwyck s greatest movie year she made meet john doe and the lady eve in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything from drama to comedy to musicals and of course westerns while stanwyck s singing is not on a par with her other talents \( her singing was dubbed in ball of fire \) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film \( this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer \) bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting she couldn t sing or dance \( as barbara did in ball of fire lady of burlesque this is my affair and banjo on my knee \) katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical she couldn t sing \) joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she couldn t sing doris day was brilliant in comedy musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy the same with judy garland rare is the talent who could do it all i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all drama comedy westerns musicals heroine or villainess stanwyck s work is always first class even when applied to material that is not she was simply the greatest and i m sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in 1941 for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses the movie ball of fire is great fun from beginning to end stanwyck and cooper are unbeatable and the other professors are hilarious to watch as well there is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch	positive

i admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film i was expecting a spanish reworking of noel coward s famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living the advertising for volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation maybe this is why i found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing but even on it s own terms i found volver a difficult movie to enjoy others see a celebration of strong women i see a movie about murder incest deceit and theft every main character here is a criminal raimunda her mother her daughter all commit one crime or another some truly monstrous who is there to admire this is empowerment i m trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this there are numerous loose plot threads here the whole subplot concerning the jerry springer like tv show didn t really make any sense the restaurant owner seems to like raimunda but nothing comes of this in fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out with no resolution when the movie ended my first thought was what that s it it s over people might say well life has loose ends but this is a movie not life it should have an ending i know i m definitely in the minority concerning volver my wife thinks i m nuts for not liking this film but i really think the emperor has no clothes here	negative

intimacy isn t about titillation or tanned toned hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays instead it s about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely physical relationship both are empty individuals and briefly find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding the relationship and the film only falters when the film moves outside the seedy flat that the liaisons take place in the wordless arrangement can only work while everything is strictly anonymous and once jay \( rylance \) delves into claire s \( fox \) personal life their apparently simple relationship becomes more complicated it s also here that the film briefly slumps jay encounters claire s taxi driver husband played by an uncharacteristically off form timothy spall speaking nonsense and totally over the top his scenes are almost unbearably dreary i can certainly see why claire would want peace and quiet and intense sex after listening to that intensely boring man twitter on still it doesn t make his scenes any better to watch despite that though the film regains it footing and ends strongly even timothy spall s character shows some hidden depths however intimacy works best as a comment on the relationships people trap themselves in it s easier to stay in an unhappy relationship than walk out and starting something new takes courage jay and claire are unable to escape their empty lives except in their sexual relationship really both are cowards neither is happy but neither makes a serious effort to change their circumstances sex is a temporary answer to a permanent problem and until they reach out for something more neither will be happy the film had an increasing energy which i liked and i m sure you would like it too if you let yourself inside the film	positive

this is one of the best movies starring children i have ever seen ozu embraces their viewpoint often litterally from their eye level often in other ozu films like tokyo story and early summer we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and often times humerous perspective now in good morning we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family like all ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions it is not as masterul as tokyo story of floating weeds but it gives us a better understanding of ozu and how he saw the world very charming film	positive

born in steventon hampshire in 1775 jane austen was one of two daughters of the reverent george austen and his wife cassandra she was educated in oxford and in southampton finally attending a boarding school in the abbey gatehouse in reading berkshire the environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth jane austen s works are imaginative full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time jane austen wrote about society about propriety and about etiquette she was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters jane austen wrote pride and prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world the first time i read this book i read as a child back in cuba orgullo y prejuicio the writings of jane austen shaped my perception of true love as i identified with the love between elizabeth bennet and her one and only mr darcy with this bbc adaptation completed in 1996 i have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic one of the best books ever written with this bbc miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book for the adaptation faithfully follows the author s writing the filming is magnificent offering us a view of gorgeous scenery magnificent castles and locations that bring the book to life for we can see what we expected after reading the book the love story presents the struggle of the times as two individuals fall in love regardless of class differences or status and yet the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences darcy is a wealthy single man who upon meeting the family of elizabeth boisterous non polished and simple believes her to be beneath him the meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with elizabeth sister but darcy thinks he knows jane s heart not to be true to these emotions elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant darcy keeping her distance and yet without her awareness falling in love with him jane austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of elizabeth family make the wrong choices the dialogue is almost verbatim to the book making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work jennifer ehle as elizabeth and colin firth as darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives as with most dvds that we own we watch by selecting english subtitles which enhances the viewing by allowing us not to miss a single word said by the characters who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the english language there is a documentary as an additional bonus where interviews with cast members are included simply awesome interviewed are jennifer ehle elizabeth colin firth darcy we also get to see those who played mary bennet lucy briers mr collins david bamber mr bingley crispin bonham carter and mr wickham adrian lukis	positive

the only reason i m reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on so no let s be fair i did enjoy analyze this i really did though it wasn t a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life or even for the rest of the day and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie i didn t have very high expectations though because i rarely expect too much of sequels once again i was proven right analyze that illustrates perfectly why sequel sounds like such a dirty word the original film had a spark of originality the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again but of course that could never work it s the same problem with almost every comedic sequel those who haven t seen the original wouldn t understand the jokes and those who have already heard them before and that is why they fail time after time so what does this movie have a great comedic duo a couple of really funny guys yeah and fathers day had an even better pair look what happened to that a couple of good mafia jokes sure sure i even cracked a smile on several occasions but that isn t enough there are thousands of comedy films out there not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable and producers think they ll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas newsflash think again nobody watches these movies there s no reason to when you can just watch the original again	negative

i had higher expectations when i purchased this dvd i was not disappointed technically but i was extremely disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of rachel york she couldn t seem to decide whether she wanted a pop jazz or traditional musical theatre sound her voice was all over the place furthermore i found her character very annoying she was screechy and not at all vunerable i preferred kathryn grayson s performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable witty and charming as well as screechy demanding and somewhat tyrannical truly i could barely watch this entire video and at the end i could have cared less if fred and lilli got together i think that was the most powerful statement for me the production was acted \( or directed \) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top can today s directors please leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves everything need not be a commentary i wish i had seen marin mazzie because i heard she was incredible rent this before buying it or better yet do what i did and buy it used it hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth	negative

this is a great show and very entertaining the story isn t the greek classic but it s a fine riff on it the songs are good and they grow on you as you watch i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character it s just a cartoon for pete s sake like some other reviewers i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing go the distance over the end credits but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version no importa la distancia sung by ricky martin and it is killer this one is well worth the money	positive

this dvd teaches the history of tai chi and the history of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form it explains that these two tai chi forms were originally a martial art style and that now they are usually done for health improvement then it shows the 24 posture form from the front and the back and with breathing instructions im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements but when i am this is a great guide it then shows each of the 24 postures and their original martial art applications which helps you have a strong intent during the posture and keeps your arms and legs in proper position then it teaches the 24 posture form step by step with very detailed instruction this is a much more expanded version of this video by master liang than the original vhs the dvd also shows the 48 posture form which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form and has other movements from other styles it has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average it has also improved my confidence and people keep saying i have a glow about me i just feel healthier and happier too this dvd is easy to learn from quickly the chinese bamboo flute music is nice oh actually my favorite part is at the end it shows a slideshow of photos of the master doing each posture move by move with great music i like to do my form along to this section because it is a bit slower than the actual form and you can exactly match your movements to the master its like having a one on one class with him i find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly i remember the form now without having to think so i can try to turn my attention inward a great dvd	positive
having only seen seinfeld s series on tv that goes by the same name it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on dvd i d never seen the dvd before but some of the material sounded familiar perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the seinfeld show you may notice that in his speel about the chinese he lets the word shovel out too soon \( when talking about the chinese s perseverance with chopsticks \) and thus spoils the joke a little bit but seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib so he managed to work around it a thoroughly recommendable dvd	positive

george sluizer s original dutch french version of the vanishing \( aka the man who wanted to know \) offers one of european cinema s most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you ve seen that version you probably still can t get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its lady vanishes plot \( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive \) and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from dok tah e ville no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they don t even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they re given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the high low mood shifts in the couple s relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he s probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame let s end on a joke like a tv cop show moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score can t do anything for this one	negative

i remember going to great lengths to fit a matin e showing of heaven s prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera our little filmgoing party of detective film fans and alec baldwin groupies \( a k a my mom my stepfather and me \) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment baldwin who also served as co producer brought james lee burke s new orleans ex cop recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke s characters and have some tangy tough guy gal dialogue they re hampered by two things 1 \) the film s slo o o ow pacing maybe the louisiana heat got to everyone not just baldwin of all the actors long island native baldwin sweats the most so much that it began to remind me of the sweating bullets gags with albert brooks in broadcast news and robert hays in airplane 2 \) a plot that as rendered in the film \( whether it s the fault of the screenwriter or the editor i can t be sure \) never quite follows through on any of its elements it s too bad because these elements could ve made for an exciting movie drug dealing illegal alien smuggling rival crime bosses \( one is played colorfully by eric roberts before he became a parody of himself essentially playing a southern fried version of his character from director phil joanou s 1992 thriller final analysis \) an adorable little salvadoran orphan girl \( named alafair by the robichouxs after dave s mom late in my pregnancy at the time i liked the name alafair so much i nearly changed my mind about naming my then unborn daughter siobhan \) and a bevy of beautiful beguiling women including earth mother kelly lynch vampy teri hatcher in a full frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time and mary stuart masterson looking like a young jessica lange in what was then a change of pace role for her a troubled stripper who loves robichoux despite the sexy promises in the movie s ads none of the ladies share anything with baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and or embraces maybe the climate was already so hot the filmmakers didn t want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor baldwin collapsing from heat prostration as my mom put it at the time i thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy dashing alec baldwin but he came up sweaty rumpled tired depressed and moving as if he was in slow motion if he d made love as many times as he got beaten up it would ve been the sexiest picture of 96 to be fair there are a number of strong characterization and action scenes but there s just too darn much talky molasses paced lag time between them and yet oddly some of the scenes end abruptly just as they re about to become intriguing perhaps joanou baldwin co could ve dredged a tighter more involving thriller out of this if they d whittled the 140 minute running time down to 105 minutes or so as heaven s prisoners is now well read james lee burke s books instead	negative

so why give justice league the full 5 stars because it appeals to every generation in my family i bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with superheros as we hung out together watching the shows i was as engrossed in the story as my son then i noticed that my wife was intrigued and so were the grandparents the characters and plots are very well developed for a cartoon so it is more like watching a dramatic series watching the series allows you to pick up on sub plots too like the attraction between batman and wonderwoman jean jone s struggle to find a place as the last of his people and the entire groups struggle to work together as a cohesive team another excellent buy to consider would be the spiderman the new animated series	positive

this series represents the second attempt to revive tz and is vastly inferior to its predecessor the series began with some built in problems particularly the choice of forest whitaker as host narrator mr whitaker is a fine actor but a poor choice to host the series and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes often walking around while delivering his opening lines after watching some of these episodes one can understand forest s discomfort he probably regretted accepting the job another major problem is that this series came out on upn which has never been \( and never will be \) a leader in quality programming although there are some interesting story ideas they usually fall flat in the end it s still a good life is a noteworthy example intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series and featuring original cast members cloris leachman and bill mumy \( with the addition of mumy s daughter liliana \) this episode gets off to a good start but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn leading to a rushed nonsensical and unsatisfying conclusion this sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing this series resembles the original in name only and even the worst of the mid 80 s episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly poorly written lame stories the kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged enjoy it for what it is but as andy taylor once told gomer pyle don t over expect	negative
i loved the artistic topics of art music in this particular little people dvd and i have to say this is one of our favorites but i do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each dvd if you have other lp movies then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there i also agree that the menu setup could be better with all 10 episodes playing back to back rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are otherwise this is still a great dvd much better than the lp storytime collection	positive
first of all who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds this is terribly anoying especially when every third shot is of the same audience members this may be fun for a home video but not for a mass marketed commercial release the dance hall crashers are an awesome band much of the fun of seeing the dhc in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence it would have been great if this dvd had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate and since the dhc are supposed to be the focus why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience it gets on your nerves i love the dhc their live cd has a permanent place on my playlist but this horribly made dvd only made it through three songs perhaps if i had been at the front of the stage that night i would appreciate it more	negative
hey angry young man if you re going to just sit there all smug mr yeah i used to have a tv but i busted it cuz i just don t care doggie and make fun of this nation s fine secret service why don t you just go to an axis of evil nation and see how funny it is then when you re sucking on rocks to stave off the inevitable side effects of dehydration when if you want to go to the market to buy more rocks to suck on you have to whip yourself with metal shards tied to the end of long leather straps as you walk and just because you saved the sorry excuse for a young lady who will become a drug addict bag lady once she gets old enough to lose hope of realizing her dreams earns you no points in my book freedom doesn t come for free so quit whining about the draft dick trickle the moonlighting tie in is cute but quickly turns sour as bruce willis seems to have been off working on another die hard installment while the episode was being filmed and it s just not the same without those sarcastic wing dingers bet you didn t know lou ferrigno was scorsese s first choice for the lead but he wasn t willing to thin down for the role and he kept firing his language coaches	negative
it s as good if not better than volume 1 of cartoons that time forgot the episodes are a bit more wierd in this volume hope there will be a volume 3 coming out soon	positive
there s nothing you can tell clearly about this movie because from the very beginning to the end i ve just heard lota f words f this f that typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness or if they thought by simply using this big f word and they could kill thy kingdom come then america might not look like what we re seeing now maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what they re just using that word to kill each other or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big f word to talk the talk i don t have any clue man	negative
crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three australian soldiers in the boer war accused of killing prisoners and a dutch minister the british command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the germans who seem eager to join the war on the side of the boers to stay out the men claim they were only following orders orders which went against normal military practice this is a new type of warfare the boers fought as guerrillas not in uniform not by the rules the australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms the morality of war itself therefore is just as much on trial as these men they all lose in the end the trial scenes are well paced and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting well worth a watch	positive
this is simply one of the best detective story ever made and jerry goldsmith s sound track \( which i also own \) is probaby the best sound track it was his favorite jack faye john are at their best	positive
no spoilers we had enough of lame japanese films this new wave of horror movies like the ring pulse and now the grudge 2 doesn t seem to have an end the genre is played out but that didn t stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow up of the decent 2004 first version to understand this film which is nearly impossible until the end you would have to see the first movie brief story the film has basically three plots but in a way they are connected to each other the first plot is a follow up of what happened to karen davis \( sara michele gellar \) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house mrs davis \( joanna cassidy \) asks her other daughter aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister karen she travels to japan to bring sara home now in japan she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house but something terrible is about to happen the second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house one of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don t know about suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child she tries to get out but the door jammed they all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost unfortunately they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited the third plot takes place in the us where a new family moves to an old building a young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the strange lady that lives next door has something to do with it people are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence review less scary and sillier than the original the grudge 2 takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience the movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them we have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other this time around the ghosts are outsourcing from japan to the us they don t care whether you visit the house or not now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason these ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way even a young little boy just to show their rage the so called scary moments are not scary at all they are lame mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version what s sad is that this time around the writers have to make the actresses show some skin to please the male teen audience this is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie in the technical department the movie doesn t do a good job either the editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion we have three plots that are poorly mixed together sometimes we are in japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the us the photography of the film is identical to its predecessor but that s the only thing that resemblances the original in the sound department the movie will make you laugh we hear sillier noises than the original instead of getting scared you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make we personally like the angry kitty sound the verdict a terrible sequel of a decent horror film the grudge 2 could have been a straight to video release if it wasn t for the beautiful sara michelle gellar no scary moments but many funny ones unintentionally of course	negative
so i decided maybe i ll give this exploitation thing a try considering i love gore violence and horror movies the reason i give it a 1 star is because it just isn t that good of a movie it s very boring for most of the movie about the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said then the guys just rape this woman several times then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge it s very slow paced and doesn t live up to the hype it isn t all that gory and it isn t scary either also the rape isn t that convincing i m not saying i need everything shown in detail but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal oh and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her and he was practically mentally retarded the guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad that is not grounds for what she did to him which in my opinion was the worst of the killings anyways not that good of a movie don t let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not	negative
i think i just don t like pilates because i really didn t care for this workout plus you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you ll have a round hard belly this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes so that s the main reason i just didn t like this video	negative
if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust the grindhouse release is well worth the money however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful the picture quality is horrendous the movie is lacking any redeemable quality there are a few violent moments but just a few one of the absolute worst italian horror exploitation films made if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films then ferox is the plan 9	negative
i hate to admit i actually own this thing on vhs and unless my mind is going more than usual i have this cut of the movie too double \( and more \) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of dvd we get at least four issues of terminator 2 but none of robinson crusoe on mars i personally am sick of it director s cuts unrated editions and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet no wonder i ve taken to borrowing nearly all my dvds from the public library no you generally don t get them the day they come out but honestly when was the last time you purchased a movie from hollyweird that was worth keeping don t do it	negative
my dvd had english subtitles the first act is the best watching the young japanese couple interact is very rewarding there is so much subtlety and silent communicating no surprise since it is revealed in the booklet that jim jarmusch \( director \) created this movie around the japanese actress \( youki kudoh \) life is beautiful star \( and wife of roberto benigni \) nicoletta braschi stars in the second act more great quiet acting she is a true beauty funny role by the late screamin jay hawkins also appearing in the late joe strummer of the clash	positive

this minnesota filmed movie reportedly has a cult following and the reason is not far to realize joe mazzello joe is a 1990s and 21st century motion picture phenomenon his presence in this movie is so realistic and life life that you forget that he is acting he was pivotal in carrying this movie how so may i add that joe s axiom for acting is simply just make it look real he achieved this to a stellar degree in the cure and also in the later fare simon birch incredible acting and i know good acting for i was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical score for it no i am not going to name drop the cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social geographical educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly forged and may i add that it is a friendship of rare mutual concern honest caring and warm affection no matter how many times i watch it tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film joe is the best	positive
i really tried to come to this movie with and open mind i m a huge fan of jane austen and i thought the 1995 bbc miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel still i was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story jane austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst this film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of austen s humor for example an unmarried man and woman would never greet each other in their pajamas a man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown when these rules of propriety are ignored by the film how are we supposed to understand or believe that it s a big deal when lydia runs away with wickham another example is lady catherine this is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions yet in this film we see her barge into the bennet household in the middle of the night and wake lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning \( when lady catherine wouldn t have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark no streetlights remember to the bennet household \) because no one adhere s to societies rigorous and for the most part arbitrary rules the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things another weakness lies in the casting granted these actors had big shoes to fill colin firth and jennifer ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries but as i said there are other ways to interpret and play the characters unforunately here everyone seems as if they re reading lines with dramatic inflection not acting you can almost imagine keira knightly s script having notes saying insert spunkiness here while the scenery is lovely the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a bronte adaptation more than a manacured austen setting overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity	negative
season one of nelwlyweds is hilarious you will enjoy watching nick jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage the extra footage on the dvd s gives you even more insight from the lovebirds themselves i recommond newlyweds to all the nick jessica fans out there	positive
i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at it includes some great interviews with johnny shines robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r j s the parts where keb mo re enacts segments from r j s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features however that doesn t stop me watching this film again and again a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen	positive
i caught some of this on pbs and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast reba mcentire as nellie musicals are for people that can sing not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch i m a native of arkansas by the way and it hurts my ears to listen to reba s voice reba s country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is	negative
dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless	negative
saw this on the box last night i sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve it didn t i kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film the dialogue is wooden the plot is pathetic the whole set up is unconvincing it looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole vegas craze which ranges from csi to the cooler \( incidentally the cooler is another one to avoid \) i would give this zero stars if i could	negative
okay i gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it didn t play right but after viewing it without the technical problems i would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter a good addition to any collection ancient muscle conditioning not many dvd s out there on the subject i ve edited my original review and it won t allow me to give it more stars but i d give it 4 sorry mr keen if i cost you sales on this i commend you for putting this out	negative
i m not sure why i never watched ghost before until last night for some reason i didn t pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on tv i m glad i gave it a chance because this is a good movie what makes it good is its skillful mixture of suspense romance comedy and the supernatural that would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance i was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where i couldn t wait to see what was coming next there were a few convenient capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work i m a rather pragmatic person but by the time these things came up i was so caught up in the story that i wanted these things to be possible obviously the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well i wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching ghost i was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with whoopie goldberg so i want to confess that i thought her best supporting actress oscar was well deserved i figure that i was one of the last persons in america to see ghost but if there are others of you out there who still haven t seen it give it a look it s well worth it	positive
this film is boring so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop this is a soap opera about politics oil companies it s weird jump around style is confusing pointless do yourself a favor and don t bother w this garbage	negative
the latin moves in this workout seem strangely like american aerobics to me you can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves but if you re interested in latin dance my advice is to buy brazilian dance workout with vanessa isaac instead this workout just isn t as energetic and fast paced as it looks	negative
i had the distinct pleasure of seeing richard jeni live a few years ago and i gotta tell you that i really almost peed my pants he was astoundingly funny this dvd definitely captures his comic genius although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed it was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which from what i heard was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get which is itself really sad he developed what i think is the best comedy which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are ultimately pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world he will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do and by doing so how we should and can be a lot better than we are	positive
ahhhh what a great movie i cry at the end every time i remember when i was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of apollo 13 however i am severely dissappointed with the widescreen dvd those who created it did not use the original film but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen vhs version there are many instances when this is evident but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the lovell house after the walk on the moon when jim says i want to go back there when the scene opens he is cut off at mid thigh and you never see below his knees on the fullscreen vhs you can see his shoes when i buy the widescreen i want the whole movie not less than the fullscreen vhs tape bad bad bad bad bad buy the vhs	negative

a dvd with a message that pulls at the heart and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer strong singing cast with excellent voices a must see	positive
i could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety i think i made it about 45 minutes in despite many fine actors esp the always interesting jeff bridges who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles i simply could not connect and did not care about these people it was this huge budget american movie shorthand we re supposed to care because we ve been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else but it just doesn t work for me if i don t care this far into the movie it just won t happen visually beautiful and sky high production values on costumes and sets it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of but why don t we get faces like that in the major characters of course chris cooper has that kind of face but many others \( esp all the size 2 women in the supporting roles \) seem to have stepped out of a commercial the chicago tribune called this film sleek and beautiful i will completely agree with that but so are music videos i kept asking myself what is wrong what is misfiring i really wanted to like it some of it is the short hand story telling but the look was almost too pretty when the cinematography is this gorgeous you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger a mini series ultimately i began wondering if the original length was much longer and it was cut down so much that it became fractured and if that is the case my apologies to the director this is the kind of film that makes me ponder what is it that european film makers get that we lose in our big budget studio films is the system itself hurting some films by sanitizing and conforming them when they need to stick out like an unruly horse s nose at the starting gate very beautiful but no connection and not satisfying well that s a lot of things in hollywood in a nutshell isn t it there are lots of special features on this dvd but if i can t sit through the film i don t care about the extras so glad i borrowed this instead of buying it i hear the book is something wonderful	negative
our one year old loves this one and so do i the music is wonderful the creative incorporation of vivaldi s four seasons and monet s masterpieces are entertaining and educational the children little puppets and sequences with toys and nature makes this interesting for our child we watch this one most of all the baby einstein s that we have	positive
as the reviews below indicate arthur has a lot of fans when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful screwball comedy \( although over time times readers perhaps more discerning than vincent have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars \) and bravo listed it 10 on its list of best comedies \( see below \) i first saw dudley moore in foul play thought he was very funny based upon that i bought 10 and arthur as it turned out a downward trajectory what i dislike about arthur is moore playing a loud obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes and minelli playing a salt of the earth working girl who loves arthur for himself not for his 750 million fortune even john gielgud who was great in the loved one a much better comedy can t resurrect this turkey okay folks start casting your negative votes in the meantime here s the bravo 100 best comedies list 100 anchorman 99 the birdcage 98 school of rock 97 happy gilmore 96 four weddings and a funeral 95 harold kumar go to white castle 94 waiting for guffman 93 the aristocrats 92 father of the bride 91 revenge of the nerds 90 clueless 89 slapshot 88 team america 87 the kentucky fried movie 86 zoolander 85 dirty rotten scoundrels 84 silver streak 83 sister act 82 tootsie 81 half baked 80 lost in america 79 three amigos 78 bananas 77 flirting with disaster 76 ghostbusters 75 dumb and dumber 74 trading places 73 city slickers 72 moonstruck 71 roxanne 70 the nutty professor \( eddie murphy \) 69 the blues brothers 68 broadcast news 67 kingpin 66 dazed and confused 65 office space 64 this is spinal tap 63 manhattan 62 the pink panther 61 election 60 when harry met sally 59 police academy series 58 private benjamin 57 swingers 56 young frankenstein 55 bull durham 54 ferris bueller s day off 53 dr strangelove 52 meet the parents 51 national lampoon s vacation 50 the princess bride 49 american pie 48 american graffiti 47 9 to 5 46 the incredibles 45 raising arizona 44 sixteen candles 43 what about bob 42 harold and maude 41 austin powers 40 monty python and the holy grail 39 mrs doubtfire 38 best in show 37 dodgeball 36 good morning vietnam 35 beetlejuice 34 rushmore 33 clerks 32 groundhog day 31 the big lebowski 30 the 40 year old virgin 29 legally blonde 28 annie hall 27 a fish called wanda 26 wayne s world 25 meet the fockers 24 bill ted s excellent adventure 23 big 22 beverly hills cop 21 shampoo 20 the jerk 19 wedding crashers 18 stripes 17 m a s h 16 old school 15 fast times at ridgemont high 14 napoleon dynamite 13 naked gun series 12 the producers 11 pee wee s big adventure 10 arthur 9 ace ventura pet detective 8 blazing saddles 7 the wedding singer 6 airplane 5 south park bigger longer uncut 4 there s something about mary 3 shrek 2 caddyshack 1 animal house my suggested additions the loved one leap of faith used cars eulogy and drop dead gorgeous	negative
one of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again maybe i m hoping the movie will get better with time unfortunately judge dredd does not i m a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre cgi an action hero star a comic relief and a beautiful love interest but please don t mess with the storyline maybe thiis is the case for future shock and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person s humanity and dredd forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary in fact i feel two stars is gviing this movie too much	negative
the musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when i saw it for the first time my husband is no square and he enjoyed it all seniors would love to see it again the film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd	positive
truly his greatest film i have seen thus far not only is one taken in by this movie but it allows one to forget that it s filmed in black and white the boy elvis of course is even more beautiful in king creole which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture the soundtrack is admirable he delivered it with such effervescence such pride one can t help but fall in love with him and this movie too bad elvis was so loyal to col parker he could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be this film certainly promised it	positive
i give it 3 stars for porn and 2 stars for a movie therefore collectively you have your single star by all means i suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn beat off and then watch a real movie caligula blows literally and royally it is a little under 3 hours which seemed like 3 days and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film the small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn the most triumphant scene in the movie is where the roman soldiers attack the phallus humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro this movie is ridiculous in order to enjoy this one must be completely perverted and dimwitted	negative

we must thank the director and salute sigourney weaver s beautiful performance this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle yet ferocious giant mountains gorillas it is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of rwanda secluded from the world she lost much of her sanity as well as her life in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas without her work who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction thanks to her work and dedication a lost cause had been heard at last the struggle for the survival of the great apes is not totally over though one must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders that happen with or without government officials approval in each country involved and the continuing deforestation and fauna s loss of habitat can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved one must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like diane fossey conservationists around the world and the rwandese people in particular who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures all hope is not lost	positive
as the other reviewers make clear this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ruined her so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation problem is having just watched the movie i am not convinced there is anything below the surface prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy \( as fantasy it is \) is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility not that i can see	negative
this has to be the best of the alien films this film although not as scary as the original \( i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien \) it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first also this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series go on buy the collector s edition of the first and this and enjoy	positive

eric stoltz give s a kick ass performance here how 80 s is this movie very which is why it rule s gotta love elias kotes as a skinhead punk he look s a bit like henry rollins back in the day i like the storyline a lot as well thing is though i dont know why he decided to go for his more friend of a girl as oppossed to tomlin s charachter maybe because he knew her better this a real good view into the 80 s see it today	positive
overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal s performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it wasn t making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing didn t like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it s normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	negative
this was a hugely disappointing film i did not see it on stage nor do i want to if it is ever resurrected it trivializes illness death god heaven range of human emotion and love in all forms i have grown up in a post aids world and can see so many problems far worse than aids i am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits while america focuses on such banal subject matter larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality	negative
while the dubbing may be a little annoying i still love this movie the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book don t expect the deepest movie in the world but do expect a quality martial arts film	positive
great movie delivery of the order came in good time this 2 disc collector s edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions	positive
the movie is a piece of art one of my all time favorites the extended edition dvd is very badly compiled the bonus features are sub par with bad video quality the alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film and do not have the bi look and feel other special features are small and without much substance the extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended it is not a director s cut \( the dvd states this upfront in the opening credits \) so it not fun to watch don t get this if you are looking for a lotr style extended edition	negative
i am from india and megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following here from the few bootlegs of live shows that i did manage to get hold of this seems to be one of the best gigs ever mustaine s singing is as good as it gets live \( if you think it is bad then you have nt heard him elsewhere \) but such minor foibles aside the gig is f in awesome the setlist is almost perfect the biggest pro is that most songs have been improvised i love that i used to hate the fact that megadeth played cd perfect versions of their tracks which was not fun i d rather listen to the cd with better production and singing but here they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience a stellar musical show jimmy de grasso \( tho he looks a bit nervous in my opinion \) is unbelievaly tight he looks like he is appearing for a test when he s playing the solo on she wolf \( you can see the tension on his face \) but wotta solo the sticks alsmost blur out the sound and picture quality is great too my only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there s very lil bonus stuff on the cd some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rocked they need to learn a thing or two from the tallica guys about this but that apart brilliant gig a must for any metalhead	positive
the film seems to focus on 70 s punk exclusively anything post 1980 is glossed over clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this documentary i think the film does well documenting the roots of punk seeing as how letts was steeped in the scene at that time \( although the misfits weren t mentioned which i found odd \) the interviews with henry rollins and jello biafra were great as well however in order to claim to be a documentary the evolution of punk rock is just as integral \( perhaps more so \) as its origins i think basically letts based the film on his own opinions likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk i was disapointed	negative

csi miami having evolved with some pains over the first three seasons dips in quality in season 4 after a very solid 3rd season anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio unlike gil grissom or mac taylor is the true star of the show the rest of the csis are entertaining but the show is truly about him this dynamic when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul make this an entertaining csi and reportedly the most watched show in the world plotwise season 4 gets too involved in personal character arcs to the detriment of the enjoyable crimes and mysteries horatio has a bizarre relationship and marriage with delco s sister a mole infiltrates csi miami and the mala noche gang picks a fight that carries over into the fifth season and causes a death to someone close to caine these arcs were handled poorly especially the storyline of the mole which when revealed was utterly anti climactic especially considering the mole will be a series regular in season 5 emily proctor and rex linn continue to shine as calleigh and detective frank tripp adam rodriguez has a sleepwalking performance as delco and johnathan togo as ryan wolfe does little to distinguish himself from gregg sanders on the vegas cast david caruso contines his acting by mannerisms technique perfecting the hands on hip move the put on sunglasses technique and the dramatic pauses every four syllables style that has made him the great scene chewing overactor of the year watching caruso is a drinking game s worth of entertainment the extras of season 4 are a bit pedestrian with some audio commentaries and three featurettes covering show production from shooting to post production if you are a fan of the show you will pre order this one those who don t like this csi will be happy to know that vegas and nyc come out within 30 days of this release a g corwin st louis mo	positive

it s strange this just came on fx and once it was on i was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing even though i ve already seen it \( in the theatres during its initial release run \) and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around even for all of the bad press that this movie got and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror this truly is one of my favorites from m night shyamalan this along with lady in the water \( another must have for me \) is a movie that i feel compelled to add to my collection as the other reviewers state it s not truly scary but more a suspenseful film as i actually find all of shyamalan s movies to be in my humble opinion he s not trying to provide movies best suited to halloween scare fest marathons but movies that are suspenseful and thought provoking as annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers there s thought put into each of his films unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like hostel and those damned saw movies \( enough already \) at least after seeing this in the theatre i felt that i d gotten my money s worth for the ticket price and this is definitely a movie that i feel i could watch repeatedly in my opinion the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film don t buy this if you re looking for a horror like the exorcist if that s what you want buy and watch the exorcist if you re looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen buy this movie even if you know what happens in the end i m sure you ll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time	positive
the only good thing in this movie was ms howard s performance she is innocent and believable i can t understand how good actors like weaver hurt and phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this the plain dialogue among the elders is painfully numbing choppy and stilted and the directing drove me crazy especially since m night insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through or following them without ever bothering with close ups these scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera if you like the back of william hurt s head you ll get plenty of it in this film the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague which is too bad since when he finally has a good speech we are deprived of the anger i imagine was in his eyes i agree with others i would have worked better as a 30 minute twilight zone episode rent it first before you buy and save some money for a classic thriller like psycho	negative
sure this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics but the question you should be asking yourself is will it appeal to the average person the simple answer here is a loud and resounding no here are the reasons 1 \) unless you re a well bred blue blood who knows all about edward ii and loves shakespeare this is extremely hard to follow not just because of the archaic olde english speake but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence result if you re not lost you will soon will be and worse yet you won t care 2 \) don t be fooled by the lure of annie lennox she is an itsy bit of a bit player in the overall run of this movie and is for all intents and purposes inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an mtv commercial rammed in the middle of your programme 3 \) let s be clear about what you re getting for your 10 15 dollars it s not a movie at all but an arty pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie further the period is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short not what cutty edgy trendy theme within a theme are they trying to promote who knew such a tantillizing heart wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull	negative
let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie 1 it is incredibly beautiful animation 2 the music is amazing 3 i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i don t like about the movie 1 the characters are not developed at all 2 you get the feeling your only skimming the surface like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3 it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 well that is becuase of the story line and plot the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end i just kept thinking there has to be more but there wasn t the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn t find its parents this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don t buy it rent it first i m not saying its a bad movie by any means just a bit empty for me just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good don t let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series	negative
even though tsui hark is one of my favorite hong kong directors this movie did not at all show his skill the story was poor along with the actors performances i may be a little biased since i love john woo and tsui hark killed their friendship by making this movie worth checking out but i would nt buy it if i were you	negative

wow i just viewed spun the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous this is sort of a guilt pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards spun has an impressive cast of recognized actors the film is essentially about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts there is the cook \( mickey rourke he truly makes this story worth watching \) who makes the drug \( speed \) and sells it to spider mike \( john leguizamo \) a dealer with a junkie girlfriend cookie \( mena suvari looking infinitely less attractive than she did in american beauty \) one of his clients is ross \( jason schwartzman \) who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend nikki \( brittany murphy \) i was surprised at how funny the film was at times it doesn t drown us in anti drug messages nor does it become one of those equally tedious drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party the humour is dark certainly but funny nevertheless a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee patrick fugit who is caught by a couple of tv policemen \( peter stormare and alexis arquette \) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get spider mike i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead this is a film with a lot of energy that seems like its characters not entirely sure where it is going but determined to get there and quickly although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too the director jonas kerlund has directed music videos in the past and it shows in his impatient filming style as he plays around with animation speeded up camerawork and such like i m not recommending the film for its style though although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen i am recommending it because i liked the main characters which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki or spider mike and cookie or even just ross who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours days what makes spun better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community and we feel as if we are watching their everyday speeded up sleepless lives simply amazing	positive

most people can t get enough of this movie i even own it on laserdisc when i saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on dvd i had to have it i am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality it lookslike there was just a transfer from vhs to dvd there doesn t seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality i recently saw it on hdnet movies and thought it looked much better do buy this movie because it is an all time classic don t buy this movie if you think that the 20th anniversary edition is going to get you anything better	negative
this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it isn t what a shame it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense buy or rent on your own if you dare i wouldn t	negative
a provocative and surprising thriller \( fangoria \) yeah it is surprising surprising ly bad it s also provocative it provoked me to write this bad review from the beginning i could tell the director chris fisher was attempting to create a stylistic film however after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work i gave up if you re using style have a reason style without reason is not style this film is one thing if nothing else a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots \( also known as crossdisolving shots \) drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you ll get the same effect as the camera work editing of the film there s so much overlapping shots in this film there s probably 2 1 2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is it s full of tallent bad tallent it s more about naked women sex and drugs than the actual story i expected a cheap nock off of the life of david gale i would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this this is bad annoyingly bad some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing annette davey the editor should have her name removed from the film unless for some unknown reason she s proud of her work if i was studio head at silver nitrate entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film i d have everyone and anyone associated with it fired immediately without question sony pictures home entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film if you enjoy good movies and great camera work stay away from this film	negative

seriously the sound is the worst i have encountered on any dvd release a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles there is a lot of video jittery things going on it all adds up to my conclusion that the dvd version is transfered from a very very bad analog copy on top of all the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled dont buy this unless you are a fanatic wkw fan who already own all other releases	negative
is larry an actual redneck or is it all really a joke inside larry s mind i sometimes think that dan whitney \( larry s real name \) knows what he s doing i think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him he is openly mocking them and when they might get a tad uncomfortable but then he ll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine and they love him again dan larry started out as a normal comedian \( there s footage of him on youtube before his larry incarnation \) and wasn t really getting anywhere with that so he became a redneck and is a multi millionare now but all his redneck fans think of larry as a regular guy despite the fact that larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only nycers live in \( for the record nycers don t all live in fancy houses there s a lot of working class people in nyc who live in regular houses and regular apartments \) so larry is taking advantage of illiterate easily amused rednecks just put on a flannel shirt fart wear a confederate flag and say you hate liberals then fleece the rednecks i don t think larry really has a redneck mentality \( even though he s originally from nebraska so he has some hillbilly cred so to speak \) i think he s just making a ton of money off of easily amused people	negative
absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen i saw it first in 1995 on video i believe never saw it or heard of it on the big screen anyway it s proof positive that a great directorial job with actors \( human and animal \) who believe in a story about real human failings lightheartedness and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life i had to see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as good as i thought it deals with real suffering \( including death revenge and anger \) and then redemption don t look for the classic happy ending but an ending which is consistent with the themes in the movie and is very satisfying after a little thought the movie completely pulls you in \( without your realizing it \) and works its magic on your mind but don t expect it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently throughout the movie often unexplained at first fluke also seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and compassionate toward my family especially i sort of got it the next day and you will love fluke the dog the movie is about a dog but it s really about so much more even though the dog scenes are great the subject matter at times is rather charged and there is violence and death \( human and animal \) so please be prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with you	positive
this box set is worth every penny this is an absolute must have if you meet the following eligibility requirements 1 you have a decent tv \( at least 32 \) and are able to watch in the dark 2 you have surround stereo sound 3 you love 3d i bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately i made a big mistake i bought the horror collection which works except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently \( encounter alien adventure haunted castle \) and i was simply blown away now i can not stop watching these 3d movies the movies are all made by nwave pictures and boy have they done a fantastic job informative fun and of the highest quality this is the definitive 3d package kids will love and so will adults also once you have the lcd shutter glasses they will work on any field sequential 3d movie you can get your hands on these movies are thrilling though especially the non stop coaster rides in each one do you hear what i am saying buy this now you can thank me later 100 stars if i could and of course highly reccomended	positive
it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment considering the makeup of the cast nicolas cage bridget fonda and rosie perez among others the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the ny state lotto decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day the acting is surprisingly \( \) below average the dialogues are way below average while the plot is not bad at all nicolas cage s character is too naive and too slow and that was just sad pitiful bridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland rosie perez s character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing they don t seem to belong subsequently they are not convincing in their roles at all finally somebody shoot the narrator please though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here if nicolas cage is what you had in mind check out the amazing movies city of angels and or the family man	negative

six degrees of separation is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture not that that is a bad thing the script by john guare is brilliant it simply seems a little static with its marvelous plays on words repeated phrases and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art \( stockard channing and donald sutherland both in peak form \) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young african american con artist \( will smith \) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as kitty carlisle ian mckellen artists chuck close and kazuko mary beth hurt bruce davidson etc a really fine ensemble there are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made this was one of will smith s entries into film as well as one of the gifted stockard channing s finest roles highly recommended for repeated viewings grady harp october 0	positive

the original candyman sucks so bad but everybody praises it and i kept wondering to myself am i missing something so i tried watching it again and it still sucked as i could not even get through it so i figured maybe i should watch the sequels and maybe i would find something that i liked about this series well after watching candyman 2 one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish again the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme the villain in candyman makes me want to laugh because he is so not scary if you want a good laugh watch the candyman series but if you want to be scared you would even do better to watch ren and stimpy in all seriousness watch halloween and halloween ii if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn t try to send a social message lol some people call candyman 2 farewell to the flesh a horror movie i just call it rubbish	negative

this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great including a phenomenal cast lead by cate blanchett and great scenery and cinematography the actors playing elizabeth cecil and walsingham spoke and acted admirably each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling but the words themselves rendered the performances useless the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material they should have read elizabeth the first s biography by elizabeth jenkins it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain had the author and director been more historically accurate they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth who is in turn hysterical defeatist overbearing childish tyrannical who never shows her core intelligence her great love of her people who had a private core described by her motto semper eadem be always one elizabeth ruled with her advisors she was not totally ruled by them she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table nor would burleigh have allowed it cate blanchett s wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity much less truth how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna i suggest that he should have first read some english history	negative

this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the lonesome dove the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering small talking yammering blah blah blah from the first second to the last minute just like mcmurty s novels all the characters were just kept talking talking talking in meaningless small talks almost talked your ears off it s so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in lonesome dove gus talked and talked but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic dead man s walk and the comanchi moon the more logic one is the real sequel the street of loredo at least gus was dead and call remained not just silent but more quiet by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book scripted by the author the whole movie was doomed to be horrible because mcmurty simply couldn t omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel page after page blah blah blah and we have to find the storyline among those conversations dialogs and dug them out of those garbage like paragraphs watching this movie was no different those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut blabbering day and night even during the comanchi attacks what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in lonesome dove because from the very beginning everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens drive me nuts how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the lonesome dove once a moron a coward an idiot always would be a one no matter how old you have become adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron coward or an idiot how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me at least the lonesome dove movie adaptation was close to what the novel read like and the street of loredo movie was also an adaptations from the novel	negative
this movie is a disaster there is not one single memorable performance by the cast of stars if you want to see a little boy happily running to school get hit by a car walk home injured and die have at it there is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by amazon criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it they should be is ashame	negative

the hand of fear is not top notch all time classic who even producer philip hinchcliffe doesn t like it very much the only reason it was likely selected for dvd release over such classics as the seeds of doom or terror of the autons is probably because it s sarah jane s farewell story many stories during the hinchcliffe holmes years of who sometimes referred to as the golden age of doctor who sometimes referred as the gothic horror period were based on movies the seeds of doom was based on the day of the triffids horror of fang rock was based on and then there were none if not based on an actual film many were inspired in general by the look and feel of the hammer horror films the hand of fear was inspired by the hands of dr orlac the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer the story starts out great beginning with a fantastic in joke rock quarries were very frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets here the doctor and sarah land in a rock quarry on earth and sarah thinks they re on an alien planet after an accident with a detonation sarah finds eldrad s hand and starts saying she he it must live a lot eldrad must live \( high note on must \) she takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating the story thus far is excellent and sarah jane possessed by eldrad is genuinely creepy though why she s dressed as andy pandy i ll never know extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core also extremely effective is eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant s core and then slowly emerging the show goes downhill quick once eldrad doctor and co head to eldrad s planet producer hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch i agree for some reason once eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge furthermore sarah s farewell seems entirely forced the hand of fear overall is still good stuff though and is well worth owning it is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the tardis interior \( why they didn t stick with the awesome jules verne ish interior i have no idea \)	positive

this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you d expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a special edition	negative

the truth about cats and dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable refreshing movie janeane garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical depressed miserable pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want of course she s not really acting that s really her lock stock and barrel the miserable pessimistic vicious act isn t an act at all the fly in the ointment to this movie is that uma thurman is not a knockout of course some men would prefer the tall thin blonde over the short brunette but the basis of the movie hinges on uma being the gorgeous woman and janeane being average but it doesn t work when you believe it s the other way around uma thurman has certainly looked good in some movies but she looks haggard here bottom line a good film about the ugly duckling getting the guy based on the classic cyrano de bergerac story just like roxanne starring steve martin	positive

as i stated before i have a fabulous thing called digital cable one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off sometimes that happens with digital cable but it usually it will right itself in the end as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore i tried everything to fix it including switching channels turning on and off the tv and things of that nature i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining but even that was a wasted effort i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs width away from haymakering morris well even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this because it might not be completely his fault for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices or it might be because it s his first movie who knows but howard s mind was made up rumble in the bronx was to be rented from what i saw so far on digital cable i possibly found a person i could call my mentor when i enter the world of stuntmen when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what the dvd was messed up as well the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on digital cable i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy telling them this dvd was broken i returned home again and tried to watch it what the heck i yelled is the world against howard tuttleman you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window \( i rented it on my father s card so there is no recourse to me \) after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica i was still determined to see this movie i ran up to best buy in troy and i found a copy i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version hoping that it was a new pressing i was happy with his answer and purchased it well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights finally tuttleman will have his moment well to keep this clean and short let me say that that night ended with a baseball bat three \( 3 \) stitches in my hand a broken window and a hefty grounding sentence \( we are talking weeks here \) in conclusion some movies can t be good no matter how cool the stuntman this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot later	negative

it s difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of alfred hitchcock s masterworks especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950 s until the 1960 classic psycho but 1946 s notorious is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film first there is a sharp intensely plotted script by the estimable ben hecht that focuses on alicia huberman the daughter of a convicted nazi spy and t r devlin an american agent hired to convince alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo nazis based in rio de janeiro this means she would have to seduce and eventually marry alex sebastian a key group member who has never gotten over alicia in his heart this triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers a primarily poker faced cary grant portrays devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance in a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism devlin falls in love with alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her claude rains on the other hand imbues sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a nazi war criminal a year after wwii ended quite a daring feat within the film s historical context at the vortex though is ingrid bergman who probably gives her most accomplished performance as alicia at the time she was deified as the chaste mother superior in leo mccarey s harmless the bells of st mary s with bing crosby bergman turned a smart corner here as a loose woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for devlin at which point she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the na ve sebastian to her alluring charms ethereally beautiful and constantly pained she conveys much of her character s feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and grant portray two people who can t admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it their failure to communicate leads to alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy the chemistry between the two legends is palpable especially in the then controversial three minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy however above all this is a hitchcock film the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at sebastian s mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into alicia s hand clasping the cellar key which she passes to devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles there are intriguing performances on the sidelines with louis calhern as the head of the american agency in rio and the intimidating madame konstantin as alex s ice cold mother both displaying a machiavellian spirit to get what they want the criterion collection has done another masterful job with their dvd package including an alternative audio commentary track featuring renowned hitchcock scholar marian keane providing insightful scene specific analysis and film historian rudy behlmer as was common with movie hits of the day the movie was recreated in condensed form for radio and the 1948 lux radio theater adaptation starring the voices of ingrid bergman and joseph cotten is included as well there are also lots of still photos a collection of trailers and teasers and even production correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and alternate endings for the more anal retentive among us this is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of hitchcock bergman grant or rains	positive
this original version is much funnier than u s version the humor is dry and intelligent and the characters are very complex at times you feel sorry for them other times you love them and laugh with them and mostly you think they re idiots what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience it s not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over but this is one that i ve enjoyed each time	positive
the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame like bergman s scenes from a marriage fanny alexander von trier s the kingdom fassbinder s berlin alexanderplatz kusturica s underground and petersen s das boot the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers attention on the large screen via a limited art house run unlike these other series kieslowski s was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block \( and characters from one episode may pop up in another \) the stories of the dekalog are morality plays but they are not re enactments of the ten commandments but rather inspired by them and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two kieslowski piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves \( instead of contracting 10 of poland s best up coming director s to do each as was initially planned \) and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories i won t comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them so i will comment on kieslowski s style kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature his films often tackle issues of political import however he intentionally avoids making issue films but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected as he feels that politics solves nothing that films do not really change the political culture his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before during after the solidarity movement initially he started as a documentary film maker but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film making has an impact on the lives of its subjects he switched to his unique fictional style this facets 3 disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2 disc version previously available in that the picture quality is a little better however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series first facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu to add to that you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch after the end of each episode very annoying then the picture quality isn t as good as it could be not only is there evidence of flaws in the film \( scratches and blotches \) but the film isn t a true digital copy of the original series but rather a copy of someone s pal tape of the broadcast so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape the picture is also cropped from the original especially on the bottom the picture at times jitters especially during the ending credits the english subtitles are minimal at times missing dialogue and can not be turned off there are some nice extra features particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub use subtitles instead apparently all of the other \( imported \) editions of the dekalog are of better quality offer more extras than this edition which is inexcusable given the price	negative
david cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of stephen king s novel and christopher walken was superb in his portrayal of johnny smith \( no middle initial \) the supporting cast added to the film martin sheen was a convincing greg stilson \( was this a warm up for his west wing role \) i m a big fan of tom skerritt and i didn t recognize herbert lom from his pink panther role this movie \( and the book \) are put in the horror genre but i would consider the story to be true science fiction smith s character was in a coma for several years and the story s premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities there is nothing supernatural about the villains they re just normal bad people this movie is not completely faithful to the movie some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie \( 104 minutes \) instead of a 400 page novel some of the changes add moderate suspense keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first i do question the need for some of the changes i don t know why johnny smith s psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie \( he could learn things touching people s clothes or a geographic spot in the book \) and i didn t think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book \( this made for what i considered weaker parts of the movie \) true science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person puts them in an abnormal situation and thus investigates the person s character due to the time constraints of the movie it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience smith had but they were not absent either as a result the story \( both book and movie \) have a feel of a classic tragedy this movie is not for children though it could have easily gained a pg rating \( this movie came out the year before pg 13 was introduced \) the r rating was gained by one usage of the f word a couple of seconds of a revealed breast and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character \( cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies like scanners videodrome and the 1986 remake of the fly this movie had him more subdued but very effective \) besides the r rating there are aspects of the story \( equally true in the novel as in the movie \) that i find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister this is because of its dependence on situation ethics adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of johnny smith because of the situations in spite of these misgivings i think this was an excellent movie i think it was worthy of several awards such as acting nominations for walken and sheen for adapted screenplay and for best picture	positive
in america is a near perfect movie dealing w grief and learning to live again after tragedy it is also about hope the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks besides a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child s camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see if for nothing else than the performances of mateo and young kristie just amazing	positive

i look at the average raiting for this movie stars now thats supposed to mean its ok well ppl this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves i read some review saying the musicwas good and well from my perspective it seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment and i would almost barely knotice if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense it was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here save your money i bought this after seeing the first which was lame but i though it was ok and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something well this was in 6th grade huge mistake i hated it when i first saw it it seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it and about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play good considering its live but lame as far as movies get oh and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing i really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made but that was untill i saw reptillian which is kinda depressingly awfull	negative

in 1973 director nicholas roeg took a daphne du maurier story about a strained family situation added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction cast wonderful talented actors such as donald sutherland and julie christie and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror the unmissable don t look now six years later cronenberg obviously oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared down imagery and understated elegance of the roeg picture decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme with disasterously boring results to synopsise the plot frank carveth s estranged wife is crazy and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist s controversial institute suspecting her of abusing their daughter he removes her from his wife s care to the strenuous objections of her shrink several people connected to wifey s emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead and carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother s other set of kids so it s david cronenberg so what performances and direction as well as screenplay are all simply mundane there s barely a shred of the sleek polished talent we have come to recognise as david cronenberg and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic american horror movies as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer director it s almost got the sense of isolation of the shining but there are too many incidental characters it s almost got the same sense of murder by numbers as hallowe en but lacks the decisive action of that movie it s close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood gone awry as carrie \( and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to piper laurie \) but samantha eggar s performance is too overblown makeup effects too are over ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama in that they just look silly of course you could say the same for the exorcist nowadays but where that film still has the incredible strength of ellen burstyn s and linda blair s performances all the brood has to go on is some deformed alien figures that hiss a lot it s not good in short where a movie matters most the brood fails wholly to deliver instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema a note on the subtext it s difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein sure topics like the state of the nuclear family and the negative effects of a mother s love are riveting things when handled properly unfortunately when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone who could care less about subtext i couldn t	negative
charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly played role as england s king henry the eigth who infamously married six different queens divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty capacious king laughton as ever is a marvel skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly cariacatured lout and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point this is all about the cleverly rendered script which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads and on the classy ensemble acting which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print \( i m writing in the year 2003 perhaps criterion or some other class act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon \) still fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot	positive

dracula how dare you call yourself a horror fan without even seeing it you don t have to like it but damn it you should at least see it you can thank dracula for all the gothic imagery that s been used time and time again in movies throughout the years right up to this very day you can also thank dracula for all the goth chicks running around and that s either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes dracula s not my favorite movie from universal s golden era but i ve seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before i buy the farm lugosi managed to create the dracula they even discuss this in the documentary on the disc but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of lugosi s dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of dracula up even with all the different actors who ve played the role over the years \( some turning in wonderful performances some not so wonderful \) they all seem to be in lugosi s shadow somehow coz he just was dracula lugosi gave a voice to dracula ever do a dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one what voice did you \( or they \) use lugosi s of course however i don t think i d like this film half as much if it hadn t had been for dwight frye as renfield frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle he is to the character of renfield what lugosi is to dracula sorry tom waits just didn t cut the mustard for me this film is many years old and probably wouldn t be considered frightening by a five year old kid in fact it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with lugosi s exaggerated stares hand movements and dialogue not to mention frye s overacting as well but the fact of the matter is this movie scared the pants off people in it s time when was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them who knows and it s not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society in fact i doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film anyhow you owe it to bela dwight and yourself to check it out as for the other films in the set it s kinda hit and miss but none of them are bad by any means apparently somewhere along the lines dracula fathered two kids \( \) coz we have dracula s daughter and son of dracula neither movie is all that bad dracula s daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse dracula s son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle chaney makes a decent enough vampire but this son didn t inherit his father s suaveness and charisma the spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version house of dracula s kind of the odd one out as it s really a sequel to house of frankenstein which itself is a sequel to frankenstein meets the wolf man house of dracula is best viewed as a double feature with house of frankenstein like the frankenstein and wolf man sets this one has an interesting documentary tracing dracula from bram stoker s novel right up to the frank langella film version also sliming his way into this set is stephen sommers flapping his gums again about how dracula influenced his piece of crap van helsing movie don t ask me why i watched this feature maybe i was looking for a reason to get pissed anyhow with a price tag like this and five universal classics it certainly sold me	positive
i was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one star someone even accused them of not being young at heart well i don t like this film and i m young at heart i m just not immature so try not to confuse the two some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing having said that on to the film julie and friends are simply dying to be included in the in crowd their first year of high school so on the night julie has a sleepover they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a scavenger hunt which is basically one huge dare game the group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by \( drumroll please \) sitting at the popular lunch spot that is a picnic bench by the school fountain that s right popularity is not guaranteed by who you sit with but where you sit pick the right spot and you may just magically become queen bee for the rest of the year in case you couldn t tell by my sarcasm the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times we all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick flicks but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it granted a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film in fact the movie s beginning surprised me with many clever and well written clips however there is such a thing as going too far the movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like well the dumbest scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet not that all the boys are like this mind you there are a few of the god like types that the girls practically kill themselves for it got worse however when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes if the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time it might ve worked instead the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction for example there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says julie i know you can do this i believe in you in a tone which implies that they re talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game the worst serious scene however is when julie attempts to get into a dance \( therefore fulfilling the final dare \) and the ticket seller won t let her in because she doesn t have a ticket suddenly inspired julie gives the ticket seller a sickening i know who you are speech telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now because of her former nerdiness she s become a poor ticket seller julie ends her speech by wailing i can see myself being you in four years if i don t go to this dance the ticket seller leaps to her feet but instead of punching julie suddenly breaks into a smile and says go ahead and go in um what whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity isn t everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans \( not to mention that nice sock in the mouth i was hoping julie would get \) is this what we want to teach our kids that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life i personally think the nerds are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything it was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion i m not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange i recommend never been kissed and mean girls far more than this film they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor oh before i finish here s one more valuable lesson from this film girls if you want to win a guy who s never noticed you all you have to do is strike a cool pose hop on a skateboard and ride it directly in front of his car \( don t forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you re at it \) do this and he will be so in love with you that he won t even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear the things we learn from movies huh	negative

this 1971 offering stars giancarlo giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison dipped needle before eviscerating them the production is above average slick and the performances are fine especially from giannini but i just didn t find it involving suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward it s not bad just average the climax and the killer s unmasking is particularly weak and anti climactic fans of the genre seem to really like this one but i suggest a rental before a purchase	negative
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie s fans live the life nowhere close to cher s and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she s supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she s like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out	negative
in this cynical day and age it s truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant \( not to mention amazing \) but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage this film works as a eulogy to arthur killer kane a synopsis of the dolls early years and a buoy for rock n rollers lost at sea it s all things to all people but it s never boring or condescending i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not simply because it s a great story well told and stands up to repeated viewings	positive
i have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv i had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and i have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out the gradual awakening of young ta to which girl is truly right for him and sammy fong s attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out during late night broadcasts the ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from james shigeta to a professional dancer afterall it s the music and the story that make this great	positive
whenever i think of the second world war the two places i usually think about in terms of carnage is the eastern front and the war between nazi germany and soviet russia the other is the pacific campaign between the usa and japan one of the reviewers wrote i m glad the russian won so am i and what a bloody war it was the number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe except asia seem pale in comparison the russians suffered greatly at the hands of the germans and the german army paid one hell of a steep price also it was in the east where the germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind it was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of jews the german program of the final solution everything i have ever read about the second world war concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind boggling it s as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last this documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies from barbarossa to berlin it is one of the best documenatries out there at least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front i don t believe this is the definitive documentary as more and more information is being released now that the soviet union is no more but for now i highly recommend this film stars 4 5	positive

ils se mari rent et eurent beaucoup d enfants \( happily ever after \) is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love lust marriage infidelity and the single life writer director actor yvan attal has come up with a winner an entertaining funny and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering three men work together in a car dealership vincent \( yvan attal \) is the apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife gabrielle \( charlotte gainsbourg \) and child georges \( alain chabat \) on the other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with nathalie \( emmanuelle seigner \) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and negatively influence their child fred \( alain cohen \) is single bedding every lovely woman he encounters balancing trysts between mornings afternoons and evenings and is deeply envied for his don juanism but fred actually longs for the sense of belonging that married men enjoy the men s lives intertwine on many levels most important we discover that vincent has a lover \( angie david \) despite his idyllic married life and while it is georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover he remains faithful to his nagging wife gabrielle senses vincent s affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop \( johnny depp \) who begins to preoccupy her thoughts she is a real estate broker and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains faithful all the while she daydreams about her brief encounter with depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily decides to leap into the married fray the only adults sharing advice here are vincent s long married parents \( anouk aim e and claude berri in very welcome comeback cameos \) and it is this standard that adds the final humor to the film the manner in which all three men deal with their living situations asks as many questions as it gives answers attal finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what provides them happiness this is a smart movie with terrific twists there is just enough slapstick \( an all out food fight between vincent and gabrielle real life husband and wife team attal and gainsbourg that proves to be one of the fun loving bits of silliness that binds their marriage \) to keep the mood light not a profound film but a joyous french comedy handled by total pros in french and english with subtitles recommended grady harp october 0	positive

this thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 buster keaton movies 2 shorts from early and late in his pre feature period and the feature seven chances show a wide range of comedy styles from slapstick to more refined visual humor to what we would today call situation comedy where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters the earliest in the collection neighbors from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set although keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with fatty arbuckle the backyard love affair for example that opens the film resembles arbuckle s 1915 classic fatty s plucky pup in neighbors there is more story revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents and the eventual need for the couple to elope there is sweetness youthful energy and innocence in the entire movie as well as great acrobatics including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men the balloonatic \( 1923 \) near the end of the period in which buster was making short films is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film there is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props and this film is full of them still for once keaton seems uninspired perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story the feature in the set seven chances from 1925 is based on a single theme buster the rich boy down on his luck must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars this absurd premise induces for much of the film a hal roach like situation comedy rather than the visual acrobatic style that is more associated with keaton as buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers the variety of embarrassing rejections that buster must endure has funny moments but may not satisfy all of buster s fans the climax however returns us to tried and true keaton formula the lone man being chased by a thundering herd in this case of angry women in full wedding apparel fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by buster s colleague unbeknownst to buster the chase has satisfying moments including buster dodging large bolders although worth seeing the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature the result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with keaton s genius	positive
i was so pleased to find this movie on amazon com i had watched it as a child and pinned over it when i could not find it in stores over the years this is such a pure love story with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real there are too few unpretentious untampered romantic movies around these days most reveal too much literally but this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre	positive

we bought this to use with our ws 300m to record a class we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording in the end we set the recorder to mono \( hq \) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other good quality but distracting save your money and buy the mono mic the quality is excellent in either setting buy the way in case you miss it this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder	positive

compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000 this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy precision what i find to be a drawback is the mouse s light weight and small size the size comes in handy if i need to flick but be sure to keep the wire out of the way as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments the change sensitivity button is in a strange spot \( at least if u have large hands \) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you re reaching with not an efficient movement therefore not applicable in games \( you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary \) these are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and i would highly recommend it	positive
i have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on op tech came up with the solution all you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go super easy to take off putting on takes a little more time but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt water etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots it is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used	positive
for the price these speakers are well worth the cost of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice only bad thing i ll say is that m audio s tech department is really bad emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer \( my inquiry was about a different m audio product \)	positive

i m a fanatic for duplexing since i move a lot of paper around sometimes amounts which i have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds the brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well maybe even the best this particular machine has wireless g built in but it costs over 100 more than the same machine without wireless and for well over 100 you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper maybe even better and for my office wireless is inappropriate \( it also should be stated that if you go outside briother itself then the wireless combo is cost effective brother essentially competes here only with itself \) that said it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone s printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router there are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you it s a complete standalone fax copier if someone in the house doesn t even have any computer at all i m a long time brother customer and they ve made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone there were a few bugs in earlier machines by brother \( comparable but older machines i ve owned like the 8500 and the 9700 \) such as faulty out of toner warnings and all of these seem to have been worked out this machine is clearly out of beta earlier machines were difficult \( though not impossible \) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual and this machine is far better on that aspect as well you can have faxes arrive two sided which doubles your paper tray effectively and you can scan or fax a two sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting this last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease of use you wouldn t use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two sided page unfortunately the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the brothers is the ink aspect unlike some competitors you have to replace a toner and a drum and at differing intervals i assume they do this to keep the costs low but the costs still aren t particularly low the non wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over 400 and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners i don t understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a gas tank you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper but in most instances the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer the brother is a superbly functioning modern machine at a great price but don t imagine the price ends when you buy it this is true of all printers however and the news with most printers is worse than here	positive

this armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen \( stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector \) it works well for jogging and working out the neoprene \( better than leather for sweaty workouts \) armband fits well on my upper arm \( 6 200lb \) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms it is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place i first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so i now just clip it in which seems to work fine it has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but i think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband i have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and i am satisfied at this point i am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included also on another note apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors i have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception the button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly all in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it s a solid value	positive

i got this yoke to use with microsoft flight simulator other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke but what did you expect it s just a computer game controller it s not meant to feel like an actual pilot s yoke if it were it would probably be much much more expensive yes the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick but i ve had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems with it also i rarely need to reconfigure it so there s not an issue of wandering from the centre point all in all this yoke is fairly good and works well with flight simulator it certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you re a real pilot but don t expect to feel any g forces or anything else like that	positive

this is a great card reader for the price why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have personally i only use compactflash and sd cards it reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably the shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards which you ll want to do a bit carefully it would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the sandisk logo on the card reader it is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first but once you get the feel of it it beccomes quite easy and routine this sandisk has led indicators that are helpful one amber led to tell you the unit is connected to your usb and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert \( solid green \) or that it s reading or writing \( blinking green \) this card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and i feel it represents a good value i would recommend it	positive
i received this product from an amazon com seller for 1 2 the price of what best buy was selling it for it was new and in an unopened box upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere i had spent over 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd \( directv does not have local hd in my area \) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 reception with it this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94 98 reception depending on the channel \( directional antenna so reception varies slightly \) i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio but i also get locals with over 60 reception from cleveland \( direction antenna is facing \) but also pittsburgh \( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing \) great product and no issues with it so far the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector \( if it has a built in hd tuner \) or tv for best results	positive
maybe i m bias because i really like yamaha maybe because i have kinda good ears or it s the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub woofer i looked around a long time for the right sub and i like to think i got a good one here you want power ok it s only 250 watts not 1 000 watts like velodyne but in my room \( 30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling \) it rocks i love music all kinds loud or quiet no matter i like both but i do like depth more than volume however i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it and let me say you can feel music if you want to one of the things i love most about this sub is it s range it can \( maybe \) reach 20 hertz 20 hertz that is astounding 20hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear in fact it s starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard maybe i have good ears and maybe i don t but to hear rich airy low end and bass notes yes bass notes bass is not one big boomy lump of noise it s huge open grazing pasture of distinct sounds in short music sounds great even hip hop \( which i don t like \) sounds well better also their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement at very quiet levels too you can hear good clean bass notes but if you do a lot of quite listening we re talking back ground music levels disable the auto on feature and manually turn it on and off because if you happen to be listening to something quiet even if you still can here low notes from this it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto on well on it improves movies as well take something with a lot of dynamics like the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy or sky captain and the world of tomorrow there are a lot of sudden loud and very low sounds in those movie s and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb with most of the controls are on the front set up is and tweaking is made easy and if you are wondering about the bass button if the button is in the music position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the movie position \( i think music is a flatter frequency response \) as this review seems to be getting a bit long i ll some it up yes there are far better subwoofers out there \( like from b w \) but i don t have the money for those and if someone gave me a 1 000 watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat but i wouldn t want to give this one up too it s a absolute pleasure to listen to update i have run some test tones on this subwoofer and well it can not reach 20hz 38hz seems to be the limit for usable bass although it is still audible to around 32hz 20hz is a stretch if 38hz sounds to high their are not many movie s or cd s that have any sounds below 35hz and very very few have sound below 25hz although it does not go as low as i would have hoped it is still a good sub for the money and still worth a five star review	positive

the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i don t accept having a wireless access point that hangs \( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang \) this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine	negative
we purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house with all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft at first it worked like a charm but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason we take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working then last week i added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke useless	negative
this is my second set of garmin radios i have had the 120 s for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530 s first of all i really like the new color screen and the added features the altimeter has been upgraded over the 120 s and seems to be more accurate my old 120 s sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes i would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models we do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top the new compass is also helpful with the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right after calibrating the new compass \( turning in a circle \) it will work just like a regular compass i still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down you can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go the 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can t see your next way point as with all the rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side i really think it s because of the waterproofing that they do if you don t put it close to your mouth when speaking it s really not that bad i did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications lock up problem i have experienced this once or twice the first time i used them i did the garmin update and have not had the problem since overall these new 530 s are great i have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week now that i have 4 of these \( 2 120 s and 2 530 s \) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group looking forward to the ski slopes this winter we always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours if you do a lot of outdoor activities or any geocaching with more than one person these are perfect	positive

this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design they don t tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea the portable dvd player is great the tv is horrible when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken don t buy this for the tv we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in this one was a total waste of money	negative

hard to believe this product is still being sold when it s not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods also the claims of good design i feel are overstated finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won t be long until they re shaking this may influence what music you ll end up playing through the system all said though i d be happy with it for the price if only they d update it to fully handle my ipod	negative
i ve found the befsx41 \( v2 0 \) to be very problematic with firmware version 1 50 18 some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes bringing down the entire net with the newer firmware version 1 52 10 it fixes this problem but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server \( passthru tcp port 80 \) making the router totally unusable tech support was friendly and helpful and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1 50 18 for our websites and upgrade each time to 1 52 10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking so now we upgrade downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week and each time we do it brings down our net i ve also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands you cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips also it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number even though they map to two different computers this makes it impossible for example to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time	negative
the only thing i don t like about it is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use i did like the way xp found this scanner right away with no disks or software i have a cannon scanner i just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with xp with out cannons software the cannon was so bad that i purchased this one all in all i like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers	positive
i loved this printer the print quality is truly phenomenal i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months exactly one month after the 1 yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp won t do anything for me after speaking to 8 people on the phone \( only one of which i understood fully \) and 3 supervisors they just said that i m sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts	negative
i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially but when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network there really weren t any issues just following the directions \( and avoiding the easysecure option \) worked fine i would highly recommend this printer the quality of the printing is excellent the feature function set is quite high for a moderate price and it s a great home office printer that has lots to offer	positive
if you want a budget home theater system for under 200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony ht ddw700 this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room considering the price sound quality is actually better then expected for me the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren t and are a bit heavier then they look the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin they are fixed and can t be replaced also if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you the 8 subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under 200 it isn t powered is very light \( only 9 lbs \) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs it should be enough in most cases an extra digtal input or two wouldn t hurt but again the system is under 200 setup couldn t be easier you just hook up the included microphone place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance delay and volume levels the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don t really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all basically if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under 200 then there isn t much better then the sony ht ddw70	positive
very simply put the sound is wonderful the design stinks i too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones that lasted 2 days and they fell off i don t know what bose is thinking clearly they are not doing any end user testing update bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently don t fall off pretty cool i gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to	negative
i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office i had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i d get some good listening along with the good looks my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem i was very disapointed	negative
i had the tx sr304 everything sounded great however certain times when i played my dvd the onyko produced a loud high pitched ear piercing sound sounds almost like a record scratching the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu when it replays the music theme the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again then making that loud sound everything was great but this one problem made me return this item which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise	negative

great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that clear easy to read display and instructions menus and interface are self intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it no downloads activations or learning required satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast accuracy is impressive with spot on instructions and updated maps even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand all manufacturers seem to sell them as options \( garmin included \)	positive

the only good thing about this product is its price \( i saw it being sold at 160 on some other site \) there are several shortcomings though the greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu there is no home location also there are only two navigation options available shortest time shortest distance so if you are caught in a traffic jam for example there is no detour function also you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa the maps are probably very old i used this device in nj va mn in every state i faced problems multiple times when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead it would not tell me to keep on left right or it would ask me take turns when there were none the unit was very slow in calculating routes \( i dont know how the sirf star iii chip helps \) also it would freeze often i would need to reset it at critical junctions the viamichellin website is only dedicated to europe when i went to register my product i had to register it in viamichellin uk since there was no option for us i dont think they have any support for the us models the pois are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range i returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months it was great on part of amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy \( although they deducted 20 restocking fee \)	negative
i m very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i m very happy	positive
do not buy this system for the money there are much better systems out there i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers the main problem with the system \( which bose has corrected by the way \) is that the acoustimass component \( bose s fancy name for a subwoofer \) is not active \( or powered \) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges the result is that you get a very tinny sound out of most applications including dvd s i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely and the size of the cubes is nice still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system but hey got sucked into the bose marketing machine	negative

to my eyes the printer s rendition of colors is above average it isn t horrible but neither is it the best pricewise it s an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature we ve been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via tray 2 \( the default paper supply \) and haven t any problems the manual \( electronic file \) advises never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels so it s a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label a wonderful quality of experience is the near instant on \( very minimal warmup \) feature and it s quiet my previous okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing its time delay was also a disadvantage i think most people will be very happy with the hp	positive

for the price i doubt you could do better true there are higer end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance but if all you re after is a significant improvement in the quality of every channel and dvd you watch you can t beat the ads for it s price the biggest flaw is the device s inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my philips plasma set to black out for moments this aside i m very happy with the ads especially it s under 300 price one day maybe i ll upgrade to a unit by dvdo but not until they come don to the sub 500 range	positive

i have owned this backpack for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in nyc \( my home town \) and traveling on business across the us a place for everything and everything in its place first this thing has 3 major compartments and a 4th open compartment a padded laptop compartment large enough for a mac 17 with enough room left over of books or magazines the second compartment has an internal file folder compression panel that keeps your paperwork flat orderly and compressed against your body \( if you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your backpack you know how great this feature is \) the final main compartment contains an integrated open top mesh bag for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body each compartment has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose the forth open compartment is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff your book newspaper umbrella rain jacket lunch magazine camera ipod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go a great feature finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5 additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets inside of pockets and a separate gear bag as well as a cd rom sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap the styling is professional enough of serious meetings you can also carry the bag to the side with its well padded handle this is key in elevators and subways all and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back final notes zippers are high quality with big rubber grips the black grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear fits snug under airline seats good padding on shoulders and back panel did i mention all the pockets any down side having this bag becomes an exercise in self control for pack rats when full this bag is big but if you don t mind looking looking geeky and knocking people over when you turn around fill it up and your good to go other wise just limit your stuff	positive
i was happy with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works great for airplane rides really helps cut out that background engine noise my problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by targus \( cheers to them \) the second set broke too in a different place the deisgn of these just isn t very sturdy i m gentle with my stuff too so either i had bad luck w two defective units or they re just not made well	negative
when you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate it really seems to run out of one color much quicker than the others personally its usually red it has caught me with my pants down a couple times going to print out a project the night before its due only to run out of red or blue ink i would definetly suggest to always have an extra one around just in case	positive
i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i ve found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i m amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa s ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa s lasted only a week be warned that these aren t quite the bargain they may initially seem	negative
i have been a subscriber for 4 years back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving 3 calls a day for payment i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment payment was made calls stopped for another week the radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm they offered me 3 months of free service to come back anyone who cancels can get this by the way and i refused the 3 calls a day continued for the next week i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system 2 more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that 40 dollars i call in and state i never reactivated my radio thus i don t owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of 2 weeks later i get another bill i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything so then last month i start receiving collections notices you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back this apparently has taken care of the issue though i never received the call back this week i called 6 times 3 of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason and was told each time that it had been resolved so hopefully this time it really is to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp3 player	negative

this was my second netgear product i bought \( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed \) the idea of a network storage appeals to me but this drive just is not good in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well but that is where everything started to go down hill midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages \( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors \) and suddenly my computer reboots figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot tried again same thing happens started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 you need to look in to your own computer to quote netgears web site scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives many newer computers use promise sata drivers my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers back in the box the sc101 goes and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and none work this is where i get really frustrated netgear support i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i d have to pay to have that cr p yes he said it from my system i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill i have to pay to get this junk off my computer way to support your products netgear the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again i was freaked that this person knew my home address all in all this is a great concept after reading up on it and now experiencing it i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market maybe by a company with better customer service it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer	negative
this is my second iriver product the first one was fine but it couldn t survive a trip through the washing machine this one works well is easy to navigate through good sound the case is rather cheap the other one was rigid plastic this case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries the software leaves something to be desired so i use windows explorer to add songs and rearrange the order all in all this is a great little mp3 player	positive
i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2 0 gb compact flash card i like it but the flash card doesn t slide in easily sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they don t i d much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process not a quality reader other than that it works as expected surprisingly the reader doesn t topple over as easily as i thought it would it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in removing the card is extremely easy that s a one handed process eject the card from the pc s drive and then remove it data transfer from the card to pc is very quick overall i m glad to have it but it s an annoyance to use it i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader	negative

this was terrible i returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with apple support desk the product will probably be better with future software updates but in my experience it was fairly unreliable in its current state examples of problems wouldn t download drm managed content online had problems when downloading itunes purchased music \( the first time i ve had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes \) couldn t connect to my corporate vpn and finally just as evidence of the lack of qa on this device the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the apple extreme the images were of the previous white button shaped device this was a genuine disappointment and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad qa others seem to have had more success but i m back on my 802 11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared	negative

the product does not work in my view i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 of the cases it is not much different than entering the information manually the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective does not even recognize that wireless is the mobile phone number one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years the only good thing is once you scan the cards you can throw them away but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand	negative

this keyboard folds out well and i liked the feel of the keys however the ir connector needs to be in direct connection with the ir port in the pda for the ipaq this port is at the bottom of the handheld the 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area in order to have the proper connectivity you have to turn the handheld on its side this then requires another software program download \( not freeware that i can find \) to rotate your screen to the landscape view unless you can read sideways without getting a headache before buying this product check your handheld to see if your ir port is between 4 8 o clock if so this may be a difficult keyboard to use	negative

let me start by saying i was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going i imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up or find them if we got lost \( or god forbid worse \) i bought two from amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the amazon order to arrive i took my girlfriend s niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked five minutes later mine locked up i went and found my niece uncle xxxx why does the screen look all funny the units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up so i exchanged them but then so did the two i got in exchange i thought perhaps i got a bad batch from the local store but when the amazon units arrived they had the same problem we took them out for a stroll with some friends from mba school the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers dude these forget locating the people in your party even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks \( i should know i was so excited when i ordered the radios that i applied immediately for a gmrs license with the fcc \) the rino 530 s simply don t work well a combined gps and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product but at 400 a unit they are pathetic 1600 for four units bought me disappointment frustration trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem frankly the gps is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes you have to stop remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot then it happens all over again a few minutes later the product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity you wind up thinking how great it was when you had 20 radios that worked i spoke with three garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected every seven minutes come on windows 95 was more stable than that finally i got a guy on the phone who said oh yeah there s a problem with the 530 s you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can if not we can send you some more but i can t make any promises he explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the lcd and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution reading the other reviews i d guess they ve been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now and through multiple software releases i am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair i ve certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases \( linksys routers for instance palm treo s \) but this is no 50 router \( or generally stable 400 phone \) and frankly i have to reset my router once every four months at most this product is really bad i wish it were better because the concept is great but i would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache	negative
got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable don t even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty	positive
i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it 4 s and 5 s so i expected a lot out of them the truth is you really shouldn t they don t sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to 30 00 after shipping and stuff the mid highs and highs sound fine but i had issues with bass and mid low response especially when i plugged it into my computer plus they are not super comfortable either the hinges nip at your neck when you don t have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses all in all i wished i had spent my money on something else but they do look pretty cool	negative

the material and ergonomics of this phone is average the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience range the range of the phone is very good i can be 80 100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop call quality average i have a plantronics cs50 wireless headset that is on the 900 mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear when i have switched during mid conversation from the handset to headset or vice versa callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call the uniden is much more muffled and less clear it is however comparable to most cordless phone not exceptional but not bad durability average i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn t scratch the hardwood floor special note i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm the base unit will not boot up this appears to have happened to other reviewers this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house on this issue i have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars	negative

this univeral dvd player comes packed very neatly in an oppo cloth case and is very sleek the finish of the dvd player is excellent however the remote is not up to snuff in this department this player can play pal dvds it upconverts it to ntsc 1080i it s loaded with features that you probably won t see on most dvd players out there the upconversion works well though i m not sure the color handling is the best the audio controls in the setup are awesome people have complained about the disc tray being flimsy cheap but i think it s just fine it s very quick to load and play you may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won t be able to control most of the features the hdmi cable that is included with the player is of good quality probably worth around fifty bucks in the market price to performance features you can t beat this universal dvd player buy one and you ll know	positive

this is a surprisingly good radio at this price it is small compact and yet very robust and quite heavy it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store here are three things i really liked about this product 1 \) the am fm reception is outstanding i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure 2 \) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function this is something sangean seems to get very well 3 \) the multi level display lighting can be turned off or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright a few things i didn t like the pilot light for on is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night i had to put black electrical tape over it the aux input is a mini jack instead of rca connector minor inconvenience here and finally the cabinet is nice wood but the finish is not as good as i think it could be this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price it s a keeper	positive

i purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my bose main speakers for my surround sound set up at that time i felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as i listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups i came to realize that the bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par so last year i purchased a polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane the polk speaker which costs the same as the bose \( 199 \) was far and away the better product the sound is cleaner crisper sharper it made watching movies much more enjoyable i couldn t believe what i had been missing out on all these years the only reason i purchased the bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound i have now with polk center and bose main is excellent depending on who you ask the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system if that s true then i wouldn t recommend bose because all you re doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that s a waste of money i know because i made that mistake	negative

consider another receiver before buying delorme s delorme s receiver works only with their software \( the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers \) the delorme software itself is not very accurate just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme s software sometimes is unable to find it \( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesn t seem to accomplish much \) real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages	negative

i recently purchased the pacific breeze laptop cooler and so far am very impressed with it now this review should be taken with a grain of salt because i have only had the cooler for a few weeks but i feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate the reason that i was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps i installed notebook hardware control \( free temperature and power control utility \) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55c at my hard drive worried about how this would affect the hard drive s longevity i started looking around at coolers i choose this cooler after reviewing several of the mat variety but chose this one because of its design as the previous reviewers have already mentioned this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook this allows the cpu fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air after setting this cooler up i was feeling pretty good about the purchase qualitatively the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook quantitatively the notebook experienced a 5c temperature drop at my hd and at my cpu now my hard drive is running at 40c 45c instead of 45 50c i would definitely recommend this product	positive

things that i like \( 1 \) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it but really do like it also this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles \( 2 \) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard even if you don t have windows vista you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs \( 3 \) the keyboard has no lag for me whatsoever \( 4 \) i m a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys etc \( 5 \) this is a small change but i m using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop the software replaced the large volume notifications \( onscreen display showing volume level mute etc \) with a smaller more attractive style notification me gusta \( 6 \) the curved keyboard is also comfortable it requires no time nor effort getting used to it \( 7 \) i haven t had any problems with the keyboard being out of range \( 8 \) for the mouse i m switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3 0 which is also made by microsoft to the laser 6000 mouse included this new mouse is more comfortable \( not a huge difference but noticeable \) it is also lighter and slides around with little effort what i don t like \( 1 \) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click start then log off windows i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down hibernate dialog instead i haven t found that option available so far \( 2 \) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others but i don t find it to be a problem it s just different having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width five stars	positive

i wanted a simple printer so i could print a few prints from time to time to hand out on sale for 50 this seemed like the right one i already had the included zoombrowser and photo stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a canon a95 camera so i just needed to install the driver note this requires a usb cable \( not included \) to the printer as is human nature i tried to print without reading the zoombrowser instructions and got a lovely plain sky blue print with the words my album on it but no photo \) then out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines this was from a residual click from my first attempt ok ok so i looked at the pdf printing guide for about 15 seconds and followed the instructions got a beautiful first print of the queen mary ship got a gorgeous second print of flags \( red white blue and green \) againt a clear blue sky and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near mt lassen \( ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints \) so i ve blown through the provided trial 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge and have 3 very nice prints \( with postcard address lines stamp area and canon logo on the back the paper comes that way \) the ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1 2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing i can t compare the printing software to any other brand but setting up a plain photo only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices if you want to add backgounds titles text etc that is available as well \( got another pack of paper film and put humorous captions on kind of funny bad office christmas pix \) printing directly from my a95 takes about the same time as from the computer about 1 min 45 sec the actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times \( 3 color passes and a protective layer \) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot the finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front the unit looks and feels substantial for its small size comes well packed \( survived ny to ca shipping \) has decent documentation and a 1 year warranty	positive
you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same this is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there 1 the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about they are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them these are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way 2 the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front not even standard phono inputs at the back 3 its advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers and in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts \( log relationship \) for some reason this is not even half as loud as my 100 w receiver 4 no user adjustable equalizer only presets possible 5 cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections 6 the receiver sucks even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver i concur with the other reviewer death to sony shame on them for taking consumers for a ride this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it competively with the others meaning fat profit margins	negative
this printer sucks it started out working wonderfully then all of a sudden \( after the third month in use \) it started printing very slowly then it decided it wouldn t print at all unless i completely shut down my computer everytime something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge it also uses the color ink when it s not requested i only needed the color ink a couple of times \( not for pictures \) and it went just as fast as the black i used to love hp they are now making garbage i m thinking of looking at the oki brand don t waste your money on this one	negative
there are some things i like about this others i don t some people have written similar reviews but i want to add my 2 cents hope this helps potential buyers likes 1 small easy to use 2 good sound quality 3 good storage capacity for those of us who don t have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers 4 some people have complained that the creative media software is hard to understand i disagree i found it straightforward you can even change the titles artists and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player yes i realize this can also be done in wmp but sometimes you want to edit later or you missed something earlier 5 replaceable battery if it dies you can get another one you don t have to send it in to the company dislikes 1 the shuffle mode is annoying it doesn t go through the entire playlist on shuffle once a song is over it goes right back onto the potential playlist and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played to the exclusion of the other items on the list i want to hear all my songs at least once before i hear repeats 2 the creative media center software doesn t install on windows vista 3 this is a hard drive player so no running with it that s okay though for people like me i don t run it also makes it cheaper than the ipod nano which is a flash player 4 the cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer i don t like this because i m not always around my computer i don t lug it with me everywhere i go however there are ports you can buy \( here on amazon even \) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports so that s handy 5 not as many accessories as the ipod but not that important 6 you can t view your photos while you are listening to music sometimes this sucks but if you have a camera phone or are in an actual conversation with someone you probably won t be listening to your music anyway	positive
i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i couldn t listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn	negative

i bought two lexar thumbdrives over other brands partially based on their rebate offers despite my methodical record keeping and submission i simply got post cards saying that i did not meet the rebate requirements \( in place of the rebate checks \) the first time it happened i thought it was oh well my fault but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission this is simply frank fraud by lexar on a smaller scale therefore not worth customers time to file a complaint or to pursue it further i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again	negative

i did my research before purchasing this wireless card from amazon to use in conjunction with my belkin pre n wireless router according to every net review i d read this combination of belkin pre n desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card router in its class and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router range is what i needed above all after some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself i now regularly have connection qualities in the 77 90 range a good 200 300 ft from my router which is in another building entirely \( and both have a lot of metal cladding and what not i had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability \) the odd thing about this pre n combination from belkin is that apparently the later belkin n equipment is grossly inferior and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model these cards and the pre n router are becoming harder to find as they ve been superseded by the newer \( inferior \) models currently in the stores so if you have to operate wireless at great distances i doubt you ll beat these belkin models for at least the immediate future	positive

i used to like my viking 512mb cf card a lot i had such a card for more than a year in that period i used it in my camera it s filled up for several times also occationally i use a card reader \( simpletech \) to write read that card to transfer some big files between computers it s all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading i got cf card error on my camera fortunately after i delete a few pictures i could move on i gave the card to other people so i don t know how it s doing now after that i purchased another viking 512mb half year ago i used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet now i am getting consistent cf card error message on my camera even after re format for several times while i don t have that problem if i use another card one theory i heard was that a card reader may damage a card i can not verify though anyway i will have to buy another card now and it won t be viking for this time one month later i contacted with their customer support they gave me a number for return and i mailed back my damaged cf card they sent back a new one in a week the new one is working fine so far the exchange was not difficult they did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt they only verified the serial number that s good	negative
the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette mp3 cd and radio capability so didn t have much of an option but to get this one i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality overall i think its a good buy	positive
the dvds are a rip off although i m counting on the rebate to at least break even \( not counting my time \) the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk \( i d recommend verbatim s dvd r dl product made in singapore \) as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i haven t submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments	negative
the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case i can t believe the case didn t come this way and that s just the start of the problems the dials are fussy and it s not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case if you haven t cut any slits in it and re tune your station in minneapolis st paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown but that station has howitzer power forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city granted i didn t buy this to listen to fm or shortwave it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that won t happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area that s really difficult to imagine being other radios i own even chintzy giveaway promotional radios can pull in most any station in the metro area if this is an example of grundig s work i d say they rely more on their brand name than their products	negative

like the name suggests the m audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first however when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496	positive
i bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn t be happier the phones have the clarity of a corded phone the built in intercom system is perfect the phones allow you to name the handsets as we did \( kitchen basement bedroom etc \) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers they have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in as well as jacks for headset \( though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary one problem with these phones is the batteries in the year that we have had them the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours and we would go through all four phones leave a phone off the charger and in a day it s useless the only solution was to replace the batteries \( which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re programming all the phone numbers \) i recommend the energizer er p240 which is a nickel metal hydride battery and won t develop the ni cad memory effect i love that the base station has a place for 4 aaa batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage	positive

i m not a system analyst so i need really clear instructions for any new device i bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which i could view from the internet at my office troubles i encountered 1 \) set up was impossible i finally figured out that i had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free internet connection i wasn t willing to do this 2 \) i could view from the internet within my home network but not from my office 3 \) had to convince one of my company s it system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera s system took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure which worked until i had to reset my router 2 weeks of use in one year 4 \) i have never been able to have the camera send snap shots to my e mail or ftp folder d link tech support confirmed that i was setting it up correctly but the feature doesn t work i was told by d link tech support that i may need to disable my internet security program no can do 5 \) d link tech support may not have access to this product they are not able to respond to my inquiries they would send me answers but not to the questions i asked 6 \) the weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time i have tried to purchase so i have not been able to install on the outside of my home it therefore must be used inside which is not what i need i could have paid 80 for an indoor camera every so often when i have a few hours to burn i drag it out and try to make the thing work for the couple weeks it was viewable on the internet it provided a nice view of my home but it wasn t useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation	negative

the headphones sound great no arguement there however i was removing the plastic tips \( which need to be changed every several months \) and the headphones broke the company has only a one year warranty so i was out of luck again i thought the sound was great but for this price i would expect them to be more durable i was hardly touching them when they broke off also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times	negative

i just purchased a mogo mouse and i m amazed at how usable it is i was extremely skeptical \( and probably wouldn t have bought one \) until i was able to try a colleague s mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is the one thing and it s a pretty big thing is the lack of scroll wheel technology that s a sorely missed feature in this mouse that said there are always trade offs but in this case that s the only one battery life seems great usability is great convenience is great just add the touch pad and it ll be the mouse for notebook computer users	positive
i haven t had any problems using this dvd cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger in fact setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual it was truly plug and play minor quibbles the open close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case and only the lite version of toast 6 is included bottom line i would buy this burner again given my experiences using it	positive
i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it 1 5 feet onto a hardwood floor the unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price i wasn t at all surprised when it stopped working the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap the touchscreen is very tedious to customize \( i write software for a living and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen \) i can t imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen unless you are very comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit aside from the touchscreen s fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote did i mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months in short this product is crap i might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less	negative

for this price these are a steal purchased mine for 15 \( with shipping \) and let me tell you it was worth it the headphones come with a 1 4 converter too so you can use them for cd players and amps the sound quality is good and the headphones don t hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours these are an amazing deal for the price i m honestly surprised these arn t marked for 50 don t pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones	positive
these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity \( 12x \) at 1 4 the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology	negative

we now have three of the k850 printers in use one with a built in print server second paper tray and duplexer so far the printers have proved to be reliable fast and comparatively inexpensive to operate power on pre print and post print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer capable of using the same hp 10 black and hp 11 individual color ink cartridges as well as replacement print heads as the hp business ink jet 1100d and hp business ink jet 1200d the k850 shares the same low per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph white horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads shipped with the new printer are defective the printer handles paper sizes up to 13 x 19 so it easily handles b size \( tabloid 11 x 17 \) paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters the printer software installs without problem although a reboot will likely be required for network capable k850 printers the software install automatically finds k850 printers on the network and adds a hp standard tcp ip port to the computer configuration for communication with the printer for non network capable k850 printers both usb and parallel port connections are supported positives uses ink that is compatible with other printer models helping to keep operating costs down fast printing for full page color and even faster black printing with spot color large format color printing which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced printing stops automatically user replaces ink cartridge and printing continues separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges heads after ink cartridge replacement larger capacity ink cartridges and lower operating cost negatives minimal install of hp software from the cd requires at least 100mb low capacity hp 13 print cartridges ship with the printer power on pre print and post print noise just like the business ink jet 1100d and 1200d however there is very little noise produced while printing cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges similar to that used on the 1200d large footprint	positive

this is a great product for those who probably don t write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally	positive
the only good thing i can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works but software installation is long and tedious \( and took three times on one laptop to get to work \) installed drivers cause my pc to take 45 seconds longer to boot and sometimes \( about 30 \) stop the shut down sequence \( i have to click end in a dialogue box \) the ink runs out \( even the big black one \) amazingly quickly and replacements are 54 at costco it seems you gotta get only hp cartridges as third party cartridges fail i ll never buy another hp printer	negative
i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it s biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an abc book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use	positive
i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and wouldn t do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it doesn t help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem	negative
received the product it was not fully functional the buttons worked but the mouse would not track i loaded the software trouble shot everything even put up with maddeningly insane questions from kensington tech support \( did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in \) however amazon com was very quick and gracious in the return remarking on the design seemed to fit well in my hand though it was a bit bulky usb cord was very long a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly i m a bit disappointed i was always a fan of kensington products starting with the 90s trackball i also have a cordless optical notebook mouse i ve been seeking a replacement b c it chews through batteries like none other so far i am 0 2 on satisfaction with kensington mice	negative

i m so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i don t have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them very cool	positive
i ve owned two of these now the screen s great and i love the wireless headphones terrific for very small children our 2 year old drove to new mexico and back \( well we drove and he watched videos \) with this thing unfortunately both units broke after less than a year of use the first one just stopped working \( with a dvd permanently trapped inside \) the second one just developed an intermittent white out and screen noise that s happening once a minute now so i am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one all of these little players seem to have reliability problems so my main advice to everybody is buy the extended warranty and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles you will be cashing it in	negative
this is a great product it was easy to mount and looks great the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees this hasn t caused any problems and i m sure this is well within its design strength highly reccommended	positive

i had owned an lg burner and from the time i got it it never worked right i must have made 60 or 70 coasters before i decided that it was nt the media it was the crappy lg brand burner i was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good but as i found out with my lg experience that is not always true my brother has an older model sony burner and although his is slow it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it so i took a chance and purchased the sony dru 810a that was the best decision i could have made i will never buy another brand burner other that sony brand i have had this burner about 7 or 8 months i am a very heavy burner and i have not made one coaster one thing i loved about my brother s sony burner is that i could use any brand of media the same thing is true of the dru 810a i don t have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is this burner loves everything i had looked at the plextor brand but i did nt want to pay 100 00 and i looked at nec brand liteon benq etc but i am so happy that i passed on them all and got the sony it burns super fast some people say that it is loud but it s not loud to me i got my burner from tiger direct for 50 00 my sister s computer came with a crappy lg brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too so for christmas i am buying her a sony dur 810a so she can finally burn some movies for my money this is the best burner bar none	positive

i have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is not true i purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids she and i both have newer nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all with hers we can make a connection and following drections carefully we can get it to energize the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality the printer will not pull the paper though properly \( we have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son in law look at it \) i read reviews by others but feel this printer is simply not reliable i wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase in my opinion canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras i m in the process of trying to return it to amazon we re going to buy an hp which i should have done initially thank you	negative

warning this unit has flaws that can render it useless my intention was to share my dvi monitor with my usb keyboard and mouse between my pc and mac simple enough this unit fit the bill according to the specs however as soon as i hooked everything up per the directions the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop i had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about alright 20 minutes googling for support lead me to the conclusion that i needed to perform firmware upgrade warning don t do it attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from xp will most certainly render it a paperweight there is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails and it will under xp when i tried the update i the utility reported tramsit error note the spelling on the word transmit that is how belkin spells it in the utility if they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader what chance is there the code is quality anyway that was the kiss of death the unit was dead and had to be sent back for rma unacceptable i would not recommend this product to anyone it is the worst kvm ever	negative
this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment	negative
they are everything the other reviewers said they were and i too can t wait until the printing is darker and in color wish it didn t take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade	positive

if you re an anti commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over if however you don t like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard am fm you might like this tuner many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting hd signals the quality of hd is most amazing on quiet passages in classical music there is no noise at all very quiet you do notice the hdt 1 is quite sensitive it will pull in stations that other tuners won t and i m not even talking about the hd2 streams that the stations are starting to feature clear channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with hd their stations sound good and most of the fm s are doing hd2 a few have some interesting formats not heard on most am fm stations i hope the get even more adventurous my only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get hd to lock in on am or fm i don t believe that to be a fault of the tuner it s the hd system and just like fm did i m sure it will improve \( ask someone over 50 about fm drift \) i give it 5 stars it s not perfect but for the price it s very good and for a first generation product i don t think it could be better than this	positive
well i got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker then the rear right channel didn t work at all after calling tigerdirect to see about a refund the first customer service rep was rude and unwilling to help said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown ups box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts after getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough the headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn t sound that good at all	negative

as a musician who s dealt w opening many cd packages for many years let me save you some money you don t need a special tool to open cds just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid rough surface \( like a sidewalk or concrete wall \) a couple of times the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie allowing you to take it off effortlessly getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy too again no tools required you ll notice that the cd cover is hinged at the top bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back it just pops in out held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top bottom then bend the whole thing back toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed so that the sticker becomes straightened out this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece \( try peeling the front cover off the sticker rather than vice versa \) and you re done all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy the whole process takes under a minute and you ll still have the money in your pocket that you didn t spend on an iffy cd opening tool to buy another cd with	negative

i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are user friendly that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons \( sound changing tracks pause etc \) are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and don t fit well i bought a yellow psyc sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is 3 times the product that this one is the sound is near perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i wouldn t write sony off simply b c of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them	negative
i ve had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light so i was happy to find this one however with my first eagle the alarm didn t go off amazon was great about the exchange for a new one \( kudos \) my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won t light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough	negative

good thing first efficient on battery convenient and compact doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge thats it as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony utterly non user friendly i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy i had 1gb of atrac songs on this player from my computer then one day my computer hdd crashed i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me \( a very indifferent group of people \) it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt that it is absolutely infuriating	negative

they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably won t cut the cheese	positive

i bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it the first unit i received would not turn on at all i contacted philips tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense fortunately amazon has a very nice return policy and i sent it back to them instead amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit the replacement stereo arrived in short order and i was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which didn t seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that i was replacing after listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a sony cmt ne3 bookshelf stereo that i own here are my thoughts 1 the fm reception is not as good as the cmt ne3 both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length the philips stereo however would hiss and crackle as i moved around the room my body interfered with the reception this did not happen with the sony stereo 2 the sound quality is not as good as the cmt ne3 playing the same song side by side on the two stereos i found that the philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the cmt ne3 the sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality also there seemed to be significant distortion in the high frequencies on the philips stereo making s sounds sound more like h sounds i also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input 3 the ergonomics of the philips stereo are not so good for one thing the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped if that happens the cd can get wedged in the cd tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove the electronically actuated cd door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top loading cmt ne3 the volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening this means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting finally the stereo is a bit bigger than i was expecting \( though i could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it \) i am in the process of returning this stereo and i will try to find a sony system instead unfortunately amazon no longer sells the cmt ne3 which i bought just about a year ago i don t understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos the only difference between the sony i bought last year and one i bought in 1989 is the ability to play mp3 cds	negative
okay this is not a review of the product itself but i strongly encourage you to consider not getting an n e w warranty they are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things if you had anything to do with the device not working \( e g you dropped it forget about it they aint gonna fix replace it whatever \) they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia \( of course you have to pay for the shipping \) lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n e w warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n e w will take months to pay them for the work they did if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it	negative

this switch works really well i use it between a windows xp and windows 98 operating systems when switching to windows 98 control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly however when switching to the xp os control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds i also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one usb port on the pc it frees up a port using the numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch it also has buttons on the device itself to select which pc to control i rate this product 5 stars when i posted the first time i thought i put 5 stars but i must have accidentally selected 2 i recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price	negative
great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your ipo	positive
i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel 15 klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i ve replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost 20 more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money s worth	negative

i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i don t have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it s the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2 0 sd mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i m very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future	positive
i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v moda earbuds came in they are awesome the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon so i feel pretty good about the purchase	positive
i would encourage anyone in the market for a shredder to first identify where the machine is to be placed if you want something cute and compact then keep looking this sb 97cs is a work horse in every sense of the word consequently it may not appeal to one s feminine traits although the size can be a bit formidable for home use it s power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others i was surprised at just how quiet it was the controls are easy to master and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child having had a lessor \( un named \) shredder i knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste paper basket sized machines for less money being one who regularly shreds credit card bait checks and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years this sb 97cs shredder was a must have i doubt that i ll outgrow this machine i ve had this shredder for only a couple of months now and i expect to have it for many years to come it is necessary to oil the cutters after each full basket though if you are the disciplined and conscientious type this is not a problem however i can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don t read instructions	positive
i bought a netgear wg311t wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed first i coudln t get a connection to the router two conversations with tech support in india produced the information that i had to download a new driver for windows xp sp2 from the internet i installed the new driver which allowed me to connect to the router but not reliably to the internet a third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that i change my web browser \( i m using ie \) instead i bought a linksys card which worked straight out of the box don t buy this product if you re not convinced go to the netgear user forum and read the horror stories there	negative
i installed this unit on my hp amd 64 x2 with a 19 inch lcd monitor installation was very straightforward with no problems experienced the unit has two rows of power outlets eight outlets total all are surge protected but only one row has battery backup each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets the unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line and interacts well transparently my dsl service the unit comes with a usb connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer also included is powerchute personal edition software this software replaces the ups option used under the power icon of widow s xp control panel powerchute pe allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user s needs powerchute pe automatically loads at computer startup and resides as an icon on the right side of the window s task bar it monitors the unit s status and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference in order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly i only attached the pc and monitor to the powered row of outlets transformers seem to use a lot of power and to gain the most time available for adequate shut down times they should only be plugged into the surge only outlet row when a c power fails the unit immediately picks up the power load it will then begin to shut down the pc if a c power does not become available shortly the default method it uses is to place the pc into hibernation mode saving the desktop exactly as is for future start up it accomplished this task with my pc perfectly if i had wanted a ups to keep my computer running for several minutes during an a c power outage this is not the unit i would have purchased however to keep my system from re booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily or to shut down the pc safely should the power outage last longer this is a cost effective solution for those tasks	positive

i reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as i haven t authored or copied very many dvds with it yet however what i have accomplished with it is commendable i can copy an entire commercial dvd \( movie all the extras \) under 50 minutes i have composed a slide show dvd with my own mp3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it so far no coasters i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old 8mm home movies the converter is giving me more problems than anything still recommend the px 755uf for anyone interested in an external burner installation was a snap \( plug n play \)	positive
