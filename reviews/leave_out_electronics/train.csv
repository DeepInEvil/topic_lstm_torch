i have had this unit for 8 months and haven t had any problems it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand and i have very small hands some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin,positive
the top doesn t seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering also the bottle being so narrow it s hard to clean,negative
we bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name we have been using it for about 4 months now it cooks good rice however the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said we ve got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason and the rice was in keep warm mode at all times in addition if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the keep warm mode for a day the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy so you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout i haven t tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice if i were to decide all over again i would stay away from this rice cooker i thought i ve bought a top notched product now i regret that i spent this much on a rice cooker,negative
i bought one of these for my apartment and it s quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it s a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show with that in mind it s a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor \( particularly for indoor environments \) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty s respiratory system,positive
i already had a cake lifter when i visited my daughter and her husband at christmas they were lifting a coffee cake out of the oven using two small spatulas i knew how much easier it would have been with the cake lifter so i wanted to get one for them googled spatulas and was amazed at how many there were finally found one just like mine and ordered two of them one for each daughter i have given one hers and she was delighted will give the other one hers when i visit in march i use mine often and am glad to have it don t believe enough people know there is such an item on the market too bad it isn t sold more widely,positive
i have these sheets on my bed right now they are very comfortable and soft after just one washing the price was great and the striping addds style to otherwise bland white sheets,positive
i have this bowl and the larger one they are perfect bowls for mixing the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put i was them in the dishwasher without any problems,positive
this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart which at best made mediocre toast and had that icky plastic worn out look this toaster is metal sturdy and has a great retro look in today s colors mine is red i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen amazon service has been great and with the 25 off i got some great buys,positive
this product does not work the dial just moves randomly please tell me who to contact for a refund,negative
my husband goes to bed much later than i do until i got this gadget i had to go to sleep with a bedroom light on and he would leave a low light on in the living room in order to see his way to the bedroom i have installed 3 of these units one in the living room one in the hall and one in the bedroom they light up sequentially as he comes to be,positive
a good basic place to hang a half dozen jackets or hats its a little wobbly when loaded but not too bad easy to assemble and looks ok a good overall buy,positive
the unit has nice large digits but the wireless sensors don t work consistantly the system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down we have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re established,negative
i agree with a previous review coating does not hold up comes off if bumped to hard has been used gently and the metal is already showing one thing i would like to know is what is the highest temp this coating will tolerate,negative
it s fiesta ware what s not to love couldn t find this one anywhere else,positive
my cats love this they will play with it by themselves or with each other it is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat but he still loves to play on it,positive
love it rechargeable seems to last better than battery operated ones the design has improved too i have had two of them i love how you can dismantle this one so it won t break if packed away makes good froth too,positive
i was surprised by the quick delivery i opened the box to check the bowls everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present,positive
this is a great heater it warms up the room very quickly it has a nice feature of oscillating it also works as a fan the thermometer is good,positive
everything about our miele \( red velvet \) vacuumn cleaner is top notch including the bags the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner this is just a small detail but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company s products,positive
giving 2 stars on the suction alone hepa filter doesn t self clean turn after one use a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you don t pay very close attention to aligning it just right i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it s heavy and dirt just falls out a lot of dirt when emptying the dirt box i m returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience,negative
love this product excellent cheese cutter three choices of thickness highly recommended,positive
the price went down from 6 95 to 3 95 it s very nice looking you will be pleased with it approximately 13 and a half inch square i was expecting a black cloth loop to hang it from but the loop turned out to be the sewn in label that s okay,positive
the packaging hadn t been so pathetic the tiny pieces of styrofoam that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant the cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame and one of the pipes was broken and leaking plus there was no crisper drawer included i won t be buying a replacement from sanyo,negative
these are so adorable the patterns are too cute and they can be mixed and matched just like boring cups and saucers they even make me happy when i see them in the cabinet they are a great shape and size i am inspired to upgrade my espresso machine because these only deserve the best,positive
our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs,positive
i ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time i was sorely disappointed there is no measuring cup so all water amounts must be estimated \( the unit has three lines to help but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs \) there is no buzzer when the unit is finished so unless you babysit it everything ends up overcooking this is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled,negative
this is truly a great waffle maker to have if you have kids they love to eat them and make their own,positive
these glasses are very cheap i sent everyone of them back when i recived them 2 were broken they are very thin,negative
i bought this as my second fryer the third time i used this fryer the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid wouldn t close properly and that s the end of it prior to buying this fryer i had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine,negative
we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand \( they are made like hotel china essentially homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line \) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave they are both great never been disappointed with fiestaware,positive
i returned the honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed the 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box the first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the high speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings the second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position the fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate the 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier the design defects are so major that the person \( s \) that designed and approved the design of the 6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired the first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink because of this i must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still cannot completely fill the water container to the top the screw on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright the next design defect is that one cannot at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container one can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night the last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just drop into place on the base one must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position angle of the water container to get it to seat properly this is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time i bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service i also selected the 6011i humidifier because of its many desirable features however the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i humidifier i believe that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier thus i returned the 6011i humidifier,negative
first one came cracked second one came chipped gave up,negative
works great i purchase 3 one for my husband and 2 more for my children good design however it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry an ipod and a gameboy the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time,positive
we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand that after 2 years was no longer bouncing back into shape this serta topper is just fine as comfortable as our last one my big complaint is that someone at serta \( though serta isn t the actual manufacturer \) needs to measure a queen sized bed because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides if you place the topper in the included protective cover it s several inches short on all 4 sides i know 1 inch sounds minor but if you re a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed the topper doesn t protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress as far as toppers in general we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed you don t feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper \( though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more \) definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford and the thickest you can afford,positive
2 years ago i purchased these dishes i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star until 6 months ago all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half \( these dishes are microwave safe and no children \) all have broken in the same place 2 broke when picking up 4 have broken while microwaving yet all my cups bowls salad square plates are still in perfect condition but without my dinner plates my set \( s \) are useless,negative
these are nice to keep a martini cold but they re a bit large,positive
i have owned a roomba for several years and have been very pleased with its performance so i was very excited to purchase the scooba however it has been the worst purchase that i ever made the first one that i received would quit working every time it bumped into furniture or the wall irobt did send a replacement but it only works about half of the time the other half of the time it does not vacuum up the dirty water so it leaves the floor dirtier than before i cleaned it i have contacted irobot for help but none of their suggestions have worked honestly i would throw it in the trash if it did not cost so much,negative
received this as a gift and i must say i m very disappointed at its highest setting it takes forever to toast the other issue is that if you buy any bread with non standard width \( like home made gourmet breads \) it won t fit into the toaster,negative
i was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer i have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were i bought them because i liked the color and the red is a very pretty bright color i would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets or dry them on low heat the material of the sheets is fairly thin so i am not sure how long they will last,negative
now i don t know whether you are a die hard hello kitty fan or not but you gotta have this the numerous different settings the awesome design and the fact that it s hello kitty makes it worth it s weight in gold i had been looking for one of these cheap and i ended up getting one for the holidays so that worked well these toasters are cheap as they come online here so grab em and go good luck if ya get one \( the hello kitty waffle maker and juicer rock too,positive
i understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle you may think air only gets in when you pour oil out but that s not true any time the temperature rises the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout when the temperature drops air enters the spout this is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen if you don t use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid if you use cheap olive oil \( and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil even the extra virgin \) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils but it will still happen i would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again \( i learned this lesson the hard way \) a better option though less elegant is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it,negative
this coffeemaker s design is flawed but my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best i ve received from any company in years they sent their new thermal carafe model which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of give them a chance to make it right customer service is part of the equation with any purchase and mr coffee sunbeam has impressed me on that score,negative
my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly it sucks great is easy to clean and light weight the price is fantastic,positive
i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy i would say this table is worth 20 and no more,negative
i purchased this product in november 2003 and still have not had it installed the customer service is horrible i had questions and had a very difficult time finding a service company who knew anything about this haier machine i called customer service over five times and had to have corporate refer me to a company in indiana nobody i knew has had a combo and it has been frustrating dealing with the company i also did not know i could not return this product i honestly regret getting this machine it is pricey and not worth it i was looking forward to the space saving option but i rather have no machine than face the hassles and headaches i read a few negative reviews and do not look forward to the troubles ahead,negative
i was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did i find a nice one with the arched back speaker portion of the stereo it provides a surround sound like atmosphere also it has quite a loud capacity for volume i mean if you wanted to you could really get it crankin anyway it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod the sound clarity is very crisp and clear the only tiny flaw i could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs a soft high pitched whine is sometimes incurred however once the song begins to play this whine disapears immediately i would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price,positive
i usually like oxo products but this one is a real loser not only does it not give accurate readings \( which in itself should deem it useless being that it is a thermometer after all \) but there are other features that further enhance its horrible design first of all the handy \( so they claim \) spin dial that allows you to set the temperature that you want to reach is so flimsy that the slightest movement of the thermometer throws the dial off useless secondly after only one handwashing water seeped under the dial face which is impossible to get out the water then turns to steam which fogs up the display so you can t even read its inaccurate readings 2 weeks later there is still steam under the dial useless again and to pour salt on my already stinging wound i had emailed oxo to inquire about how to return this item and get a refund weeks ago but they have yet to respond to me even though on the package it states that satisfaction is 100 percent guaranteed well i am not a satisfied customer and if my second attempt to reach them proves fruitless once again then i doubt i will ever purchase another oxo product again no matter how good they are it pains me to even give this product one star as a product that s utterly useless deserves no star at all oxo should be ashamed of themselves thanks for allowing me to vent my 2 cents,negative
so far this product is working fine has plenty of power heats food in a flash very good quality for the price i paid for i,positive
while one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles i couldn t get it to work at all i tried it on two different shapes of bottles but to no avail the problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper doesn t slide when it s on the bottle when off the bottle the mechanism works fine it appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general at least that was my experience i found a good 3 00 stopper at sur la table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle it doesn t have the fancy pour spout but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne,negative
had somewhat higher expectations given that this was a lennox got the shaker home tried it out it leaks no matter how hard you hold the darn thing together it leaks i am a materials engineer so i gave the product a more than cursory examination very very poor quality also made in china \( if that has anything to do with quality hint hint wink wink \) do not buy,negative
you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they re doing do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok,negative
the thermometer of this heater is completely messed up it does not measure the room temperature but the temperature of the air that has just been heated up in other words if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so \( according to the thermometer reading \) in less 2 minutes and stop if you do not use this functionality but instead let the heater run for some time \( 5 10 minutes \) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees the thermometer is probably in the wrong location did honeywell do any kind of testing before putting this model on the market,negative
well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic,positive
my husband travels to uk frequently and it s hard to find a good cup of coffee there we ve looked everywhere for a portable coffee press that would work in a hotel room in conjunction with a hot water pot this fills the need completely,positive
the frother works well as others have said unfortunately it broke very easily when i dropped it into the sink while cleaning i ve only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info this device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events,negative
i ve been through four of these expensive units they work great on my great pyrenees dog at least they work for awhile then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with and then i send it back for repair once i got back a unit that worked again for awhile then i got back a unit that never worked again i stopped sending in my broken units after that so in desperation and impending poverty i switched to a shock collar it was either that or what my breeder calls a blue juice special it also worked and yes i tried it on myself and decided that it wasn t cruel at all but the punchline is this the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar at least they were cheaper so i didn t lose as much money,negative
i looove this mug its such a beautiful shade of red very nice looking also these mugs are huge one of mine already has a chip on it but i ll leave that to certain people in my house being very clumsy,positive
sigh was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces i should have heeded the previous reviewer s warning doh oh well live and learn live and learn refund please,negative
worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out guess you get what you pay for,negative
this french press made a delicious cup of coffee the problem is that it is advertised as a 3 cup coffeemaker i returned it and will get a larger size,negative
i received my butter dish in a very timely fashion very well packaged too the product is wonderful it s being used on a daily basis i am extremely happy with the product the shipper,positive
i ve had my juicer now for about 3 years and i haven t had any problems with it in fact after having had several juicers this one is my favorite in the price range i also don t understand the customer service problems one of the rubber feet on the bottom split and i called customer service a week later i had four new ones in the mail pros much quieter than most juicers of its type as well i did a side by side comparison with my buddie s juiceman juicer and my yield was approximately 30 greater cons as with any other similar juicer cleaning it gets old that s probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times day,positive
rapid efficient sturdy and easy to clean must to attached to the edge of a counter and the right edge was hard to find i hand pitted cherries for 90 minutes and completed the same number in 15 minutes with the cherry pitter,positive
i just received this wine tower the other day it looks as wonderful in my home as it does in the picture it s perfect for our needs and takes up so little space the only complaint i have and why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 it was a pain for my husband to put together also it came with 2 bottom shelves instead of one bottom and one top he had to improvise until i can get this corrected with the manufacturer \( fortunately it s not noticeable \) in spite of this i recommend this wine tower for anyone wanting an expensive looking wine tower that is so space efficient at this price i ve already gotten compliments on it from friends,positive
i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail,negative
zero best describes how well amazon supports what they sell great deal on this toaster absolutely and it does a nice job on toast but after using the left side twice it stopped locking down so now we have a 2 slice toaster amazon just takes your money and runs giving the standard answer that you have to take it up with krups krups to their credit at least will look at the problem and repair or replace it if they determine it is a warranty covered problem unfortunately you ll have to box the item up and ship it to one of about krups service centers around the country to see if they fix it or not at your cost shipping cost more than the toaster did save yourself the aggravation go buy your toaster at walmart bed bath beyond or someplace that will at least swap it out for you without all this hassle,negative
i bought this because it was on sale and i wanted to try it now i want to kick myself for not getting it sooner this is a gaget worth having my husband even loves it it makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze it gets plenty of use and it still going strong it is very user friendly and so easy to empty,positive
i bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before christmas 2006 it seemed like a perfect if unnecessary stocking stuffer for my wife since we re both wine enthusiasts i never really felt these gimmick aerators did much that a solid 1 2 hour decanting couldn t do boy was i wrong the device itself is attractive compact and solidly built it appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass funnel with a rubber grip there are two small channels in the center of the funnel which look like cracks in the plastic \( i ve read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable \) wine is poured through the top of the funnel and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel the aerator is easily held and i ve never had a problem with spills now on to the effect of the vinturi i ve been using the vinturi for 5 months now on a variety of wines from a bottle of two buck chuck to a nice 98 vietti barolo to a bottle of 97 phelps insignia in every circumstance with every wine i ve noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the vinturi as opposed to tasted directly from bottle the flavours are more blended the finish is less acidic and frankly it has made most of the wines i drink a more pleasurable experience from sniff to swallow i ve conducted several blind tastings with friends and we all agree this thing works if you re a serious wine drinker or shopping for a wine drinker in your life give this product a try at 40 it s about the price of a decent california cabernet and will yield results for decades to come i plan on picking up a few dozen this christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients,positive
i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go what a disappointment they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments trust me if you have to choose between the two don t spend your money on on cs2 however it may appeal to the \( human \) avid bird watcher \( \),negative
i bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don t work well the manual is not thorough but it does tell you after you bought the product that there is a one second delay unless you buy an ac adapter i just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn t about to buy an ac adapter to see if that fixed it it cut off my mom s voice and i rarely heard her message the units also have annoying beeps that can t be turned off no real volume control either a very overpriced and poorly designed unit also the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them the sound is clear if it doesn t cut you off but the units are far from user friendly,negative
i bought this item about 6 months ago after 2 months the handle fell off on phoning the company they said plastic parts were only guaranteed for 1 month hence they would not replace it after another 2 months the unit stopped working altogether i then got in touch with the company and managed to speak to a very rude customer service representative who said i would have to send it to the company and pay for shipping and handling myself yet it says in the handbook that the company would pay for the shipping i am truely disappointed with the lack of customer care and the appliance i do believe i have a faulty appliance but the compnay is not at all bothered to keep its customers happy i do not reccomend that anyone buy this item save your money and all the hastle,negative
i bought this particular lever corkscrew because i read a very favorable review in consumer reports it is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears the guide and the frame after about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use i actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point end of story,negative
i need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price plus 6 napkins both packets arrived dirty with many hanging threads and i threw them straight into the washer they are 55 cotton and 45 polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free i am very happy with these basic table linens i like the price too made in pakista,positive

the only good thing which occurred when i bought this item from amazon was it arrived with in two days i was quite disappointed when i opened the package only to find it was a typical pop up hamper i could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run i ended up paying more for it i wanted to buy a pop up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed this hamper lacks a lid so i reccomend if you re looking for the same thing not to buy it if i had known it lacked a lid i would not have purchased the hamper it s partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product i gave it two stars because it s still functional and sturdy,negative
i owned this dispenser for close to a year and love it the cereal is always fresh and accessible and i do not have to keep the boxes or reach out to grab few nuts for a quick snack great design,positive
believe me i dearly wanted this pan to work out it costs well over 100 however no matter what i did everything i cooked in this pan stuck i tried using it without greasing it greasing it with oil spraying pam on it putting ghee butter in it etc the following things all stuck pancakes eggs hamburgers and chicken in fact every thing i tried stuck also the shape was strange as most of the surface area was off the heating surface also they have this 1 label on the bottom that was hard to get off i finally did but once i cooked something when i turned the pan over there was a microscopic film of glue from the label that i wasn t able to get off and it had turned brown ugggh this was the worst cooking experience of my life needless to say i returned this pan,negative
sometimes it sprays when she barks most of the time it doesn t so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low it s not the battery or the fill level maybe it just depends on the dog i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine \( my children found this amusing,negative
we recently moved and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment one cat usually friendly and playful would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment the other cat usually very docile was being overly aggressive during play time with the other cat and with us after buying the comfort zone plug in we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal more friendly and playful less anxious and aggressive the only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug in vial will last 4 weeks but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3 but maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left it is hard to judge when the plug in actually ran out because the cats behavior did not change even after i unplugged the diffuser,positive
my husband and i took over a house with 2 kitchens and i wanted to decorate the smaller one in cream an black i fell in love with these but never received them they were sent to the wrong address and after the 2nd time amazon wouldn t send them again and i gave up i went ahead and gave them 5 stars cause i was at a freinds house and she had these dishes they were really heavy and the print was consistent i m so jealous,positive
the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i d say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i ve been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material,positive
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i didn t return it it would have made a nice decorative throw the color and texture are nice,negative

i ve owned this sofa for less than a year and it completely fell apart the seat of the sofa is supported by a wooden frame with a nylon webbing stretched taught and stapled over it we had 4 people of reasonable weight on the sofa \( something we ve done numerous times before \) and it collapsed out from underneath us the four parts of the seat frame are held in with small little dowels that rest on a less than one inch lip around the outside of the couch frame the sofa is designed to look nice but does not hold up well to average use for 400 a sofa should last at least a year of moderate use of people only sitting on it you re better off going to ikea or some other retailer that spends as much time in the basic structural design as they do in the appearance of the couch,negative
when this fountain is freshly cleaned the cats love it the water does stay cool but cat hair lots of that around here clogs the pump and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly it grows slime eeeeuuuw the first pump lasted about three months then the replacement lasted about a month not really worth it because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway,negative
i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i ve tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it s horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine,negative
i ve bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories and found them to be sturdy remarkably well designed and easy to use unfortunately this timer is an exception it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point clock plus timer ten number keys for input memory etc but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers it s round like a traditional wind up kitchen timer it s solid feeling and has nice non skid feet on the bottom the problem is the display it s horrible for three reasons first the numbers are small smaller than any other timer i ve seen they re about 1 4 high half or less the size of those on comparable timers second the numbers are recessed 1 8 or more beneath a clear plastic cover not on the surface it s dark in there and feels like looking down a well it desperately needs a backlight but there is none unless the light source is shining directly into the display there s a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers but that causes the third problem the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective and it s virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn t a reflection shining back into your eyes the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer the light source and myself into a position where i can read the small dark shadowed and reflective display not what i need when i m trying to cook it s just not worth it since i have several other timers with displays i don t have to strain to read i use this one as a paperweight i d have to say it works very well i just don t understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door,negative
i really like this kitchen gadget as it different actually useful and my hands smell less like garlic thus far i have only used it to chop herbs onions and garlic so i can t debunk the mush mess i would simply say don t pull the cord a lot if you re worried about it i bought about 5 and gave them all out as x mas gifts,positive

we were very skeptical one of our cats would mark certain spots \( like corners \) occassionaly but we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room it got so bad that we had to discard the rug we tried boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day but the one time we forgot to spray he would mark again we were at our wits end and decided to try feliway we bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots at first we also used the boundary but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn t see any urine markings anymore it took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work our cat even appears more calm and pleasant we make sure that we replace the container of feliway every 5 weeks or so it s well worth the money,positive

this is a nice quality lightweight comforter there is a discrepancy right up front in the product details that lists it as shipping weight 9 00 lbs which is not the case at all after arrival of two of them we were shocked when advised seller they replied after many days said we needed to read the product description \( scroll further down on item \) which was different info from what was listed above they did not update information on this item for customers on amazon site for 2 months thus the 2 stars i should have written this review earlier on the plus side it is very nice quality individual pocket stitching to keep fill in place and border piping ideal for springtime,negative

as stated before in many a review this machine is the best deal for the money paired with a real espresso grinder \( which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself \) this machine is capable of producing real espresso my father bought this for me for my birthday back in december and the machine is still in working condition my only real beef with this machine is the wand i can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher however the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off right into my milk i have taken to using the wand without either of them on but this isn t optimum for latte foam the only other thing that bothers me is that i have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead this is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing but i d rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra 300 for something in stainless steel all in all the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time i use it woohoo by zoe ros not tim,positive

ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob i am more of a coffee nut i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose and for a guy like me this machine is perfect i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4 5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret i have had the machine about 3 weeks now i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient and dont get me wrong the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had very quickly but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for be it a straight shot a cappucino or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you may not be good enough for a coffee snob but just right for a coffee nut oh and one hint i found very helpfull turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it \( the longer the better \) with your cups up on the warmer i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso,positive

have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers london broil steaks it produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use the cooking grate can only be set at two levels standing on its posts or inverted lying on the rim of the firebox the level must be chosen before you start cooking which presents a problem for some preparations the damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature emptying ash is a bit awkward as you need to remove the doors and coal grate then lift and tip the firebox which is heavy the lip catches some ash so it is difficult to completely empty be sure to set the grill on a pan as grease will leak through and collect around the legs,positive

i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk it is great if you like to make lattes or just plain expressos it brews fast less than two minutes it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes,positive

i do most of the vacuuming my wife s only request when i went looking for a new model was that it use a bag she absolutely hates the bagless models and doesn t want to see what we re pulling up we have two dogs \( an akita and a golden retriever \) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day so after searching i find this model i researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me i take the plunge and order it from amazon now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and i was shocked when it arrived in 4 the big thing i like about this unit is that the bags it uses \( although a little hard to find \) have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt the unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well and boy does it clean our rugs look fantastic one complaint i have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off another would be that you cannot turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position i know its a safety feature i just don t like it the pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades the little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas overall i would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from amazon was so positive that i ve purchased other items and make it my first place to look now,positive

i m a student in college and when my first hamper ripped i decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper my roommate rarely does his laundry so he has huge loads but his hamper manages to carry it all i saw the whitney design hamper online which looked nearly identical to my roommate s hamper so i bought it when the hamper arrived i put my clothes in it and prepared to do laundry the shoulder strap ripped right off i didn t even fill up the hamper all the way as is shown in the picture amazon sent me a replacement but now i am afraid of using the shoulder strap again and i have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires this hamper may be able to function but not well and for a college student this is definitely not sturdy enough,negative
a friend of ours bought this for us he owns several coffee shops and we were excited to have great coffee at home out of the box i needed to tinker with it for a while and had to refer to online chat rooms to figure out how to get it to work correctly the problem was that the coffee didn t stay perculating long enough in the top and then it shot down into the carafe i called bodum of north america and their customer service person was a surley they offered no help at all and had no idea what i was talking about which unless they totally disregard internet reviews was a lie several people wrote in online articles to cut down the tube that goes in to the carafe by small dimension i didn t do that but i learned that if you don t push the top down all the way it will work okay after i got it working okay it did make really good and hot coffee then the poorly designed flip top broke and bodum has never had it back in stock \( i wonder why \) then we got really sick of trying \( in vane \) to clean the inside of the carafe finally the annoyance of the thing as a whole overrode the quality of the coffee my advice is if you want really great coffee go to your local cafe for day to day coffee at home don t buy this it looks cool and does make good coffee but at a big price,negative
i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought they hold an edge well and have a good balance the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives the only problem with the set is the steel hone i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife that is the only detractor from the set,positive
the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer s design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly,positive
while this is an attractive looking paper towel holder it isn t very functional at first glance it looks like it should work as implied spring loaded arm puts pressure on paper towel roll regardless of how many towels are on that roll at the time allowing you to easily rip off a single sheet with one hand unfortunately this model doesn t work that way at least not the one i received i started with a partial roll and it was obvious this wouldn t work so i put in an extra large roll of top quality \( very thick roll \) paper towels and still they don t come close to reaching the spring loaded arm this arm is no more effective at preventing a number of sheets from pulling off the roll than the old wooden one i had with no arm at all i m very disappointed before deciding on this model i had viewed some very similar models that were higher in price maybe this is a case of you get what you pay for if you are looking for a paper towel holder that looks nice and are not concerned about function it may be worth the price if you are looking for one that looks nice and can offer you an easy one sheet at a time with one hand quick pull i suggest you look for a different model this unit won t do that job,negative

when we first bought it it worked nicely and smoothly thought we do not need to buy another opener again boy were we wrong after the third use it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning reminds me of a car turning it s wheels will all smoke and noise but no results glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name,negative
i bought this item at my local target the weekend i moved into my new apartment the parts are quality chrome and the wood top is certainly appealing to the eye if only the pieces actually fit together to assemble a sturdy piece of furniture one of the shelves doesn t fit properly over the four legs and the finished product sways at the slightest touch judging by the glowing reviews on this page at best this product is a hit or miss venture there s a reason it s priced at 30 dollars buyer beware,negative

we have owned this machine for a little over two years for the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying however since then it has stopped drying such that 5 hours of drying \( yes 5 hours \) yields wet clothes this has persisted despite 4 repairs replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board which i assume is next prior to this machine we owned an equator brand washer dryer combo which was a disaster that broke after 3 years unfortunately the lg is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines \( equator asko maber and other brands \) available in the us all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115v the bosch combos available in europe but unfortunately not available in the us are 220v and thus dry more quickly this is not a machine for a family but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most when it worked it worked well however no one should invest 1300 to have it break in such a short time and no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry if you must purchase one of these machines \( for reasons of space \) buy an extended warranty,negative

this product is a poorly designed piece of crap that is destined to fail from the first day you use it a friend had purchased this item a few months back and asked me to look at it when it died recently \( i have been repairing electrical and electronic equipment for almost 30yrs \) this is a perfect example of a throw away item if more care had gone into the design and a few more dollars into producing it you might have a product that could last a few years neither was done look at how many reviews mention the item failing after only a few months and even the positive reviewers usually have only been using it for a month or so do yourself a favor and buy a commercial grade hot plate from a reputable manufacturer you will pay more but you will likely still be using it many years from now \( not too mention that the operation will be better also \) how much value is in a 20 hot plate when it is headed to the landfill a few months from now it is a shame that so many people are willing to accept low quality products these days and think it is ok if it lasted a few months \( note the reviews \) good luck,negative
i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address it worked for two days and then it stopped on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour but it only worked intermittently she didn t keep the receipt so i m writing it off as a waste of money when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense you can see when they are empty and you don t have to keep up with batteries i don t buy the argument that the hands free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands,negative
i wanted to dress up my kitchen a little and this does the trick \( makes me not dread washing the dishes an added plus \) it s a nice cherry red and i m a bit of a red junkie i gave this five stars because it s perfect for my needs if you have a large family and tons of dishes it s going to be on the small side though the red colander s a great extra as is the little sponge holder \( it has suction cups to keep it in place but mine doesn t seem to stay stuck that s a minor detail though and it could have more to do with my kitchen s tiling than the suction cups \) one thing to note if your sink s drains aren t centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat overall this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set what more could we want,positive
people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can i have tried reconnecting it many times using different pressure as i push down but to no avail at 10 dollars a night this product will get very expensive very quickly if it had worked without the leak i would have given ssscat 5 stars,negative
after reading countless poor reviews of the dolce desk and hutch i was quite skeptical about ordering it online i gave in and ordered the set from target com the desk arrived in almost perfect condition \( a few smudges in the stain \) however only half the hutch was in its box the entire drawer \( left side of hutch \) was missing the hardware was missing and the assembly instructions were missing i recommend calling your local target store to check the dolce collection s availability \( and the parts inside \) before you waste the time and gas to get there aside from the missing hutch the desk looks really great in my home office,negative
if you like fondue you ll like raclette as much or even more use your imagination don t stick with what is traditional you can use your raclette for desert pizza breakfast and much more traditionally served with steamed red potatoes this will satisfy the meat and potatoe man in the group marinade the meat with different flavors to add some spice don t forget the vegetables slice onion red peppers mushrooms romas and even pineapple it s a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot,positive

not worth the high price difficult to clean and very persnickety comes with a bunch of sensors that if not properly triggered keep it from roasting not long after i bought it i couldn t get it to start without jamming a pencil in one spot and now it doesn t work at all when it works it works fine but it doesn t always work nor does it last very long,negative
after two months a piece of the filter broke off after 3 months the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website so i could pay another 30 or so for a new carafe because glass is not included in their warranty no thanks,negative
bad quality on off switch and plastic ring broken after 1 year,negative
finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction i have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived the suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned the hepa filter means you really can t smell that you ve been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change also who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner hey if you have to own one wouldn t you prefer to have one that s easy on the eye,positive
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i didn t return it it would have made a nice decorative throw the color and texture are nice,negative
i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i didn t hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore,negative
i really like having this it s odor free and easy to use yes you have to empty the bags and that takes time but it s worth it i have found refills at walmart petsmart and petco so they haven t been hard to find,positive

normally things i purchase have no problem this item is now being used to heat water when company comes over for tea has to be the worse item to make coffee yet always purchase the whole beans and grind the coffee myself this item just never got the coffee s true wonderful flavor perhaps because it was a refurbished item but i just think hamilton beach needs to improve this item big time,negative
this fan is incredibly powerful it can definitely move air around a room my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium i don t know if it s just mine that is that way or not and it isn t a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i ll tell ya when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse,positive

after spending 5 10 a day at starbucks my wife and i got the jura capresso for the convenience of a fully automatic machine and having fresh latte s at home in the morning we have used it for over 3 months now and like it more and more each week the espresso latte s and cappucino s are wonderful having to touch one button to have everything done at once is so easy but perhaps the best part is the self cleaning it does about once a week you clean out a tray and refill the water that s pretty much it desserts like affogato \( espresso on top of ice cream \) are a just too easy to make now downsides if you ever plan to reduce your caffeine consumption this machine is not for you my wife and i both drink more coffee now because it is so good and so convenient if you like really hot latte s the steamed milk won t get hot enough i d call it very warm or slightly hot just right for drinking but by the end it can be kind of cool warm up the glass with the hot water option before fixes the problem espresso coffee and even cappucino s come out at a perfect temperature,positive
item was defective and this was te second item receive,negative
this product is not eligible for free shipping yet it ships from the amazon warehouse along with the humidifier that is eligible for free shipping,negative
reasons 1 faulty battery cover design the battery cover comes off time i remove the timer from a metal surface 2 the protective glass is cloudy making the timer numbers hard to see 3 the alarms are not very audible 4 the magnet unglued itself within the first three days of use,negative
total rubbish wood was scratched on top corner was smashed water damage on the shelf and door was cracked it is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use the holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control to add salt in the wound the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and i had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it if you like taking chances and do still want to buy it it s probably a 50 50 chance that it will be damaged,negative
the quality of the china is very good the weight and feel of the product is substantial i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family,positive
this appliance has several good features but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast at the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown the other side barely toasted the inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side we did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread setting a timer for 1 minute pressing cancel reversing the bread and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again far too much work,negative
from the description i thought these would be a lot more sturdy they re fine for storing light weight items that you don t need to access often but i found that the plastic supports tended to break through the fabric at the corners and break in half if stressed,negative
this hamper is okay but amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it i ordered four and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse how did they arrive in four giant shipping boxes each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags it took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags i live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce and this really an insult to me and to the environment there is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper according to the packing list the shipping cost on each was 6 which means that due to supersaver amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of 5 per hamper amazon shame on you you could have shipped all four in a large envelope,negative
we have owned the breadman corner bakery for about eight months now it has made our house smell wonderful i have to say i don t use the recipes that came with it so i won t judge those for the price this is a beautiful machine the pan has a solid heft to it not like some of the other bread makers with seemingly flimsy aluminum pans we have made many types of bread in it and have even churned butter from heavy cream the best kind of bread is the one made in the pan right after making butter with a toddler and a baby it is nice not to have to run to the store everyday to buy fresh bread or rolls the only time our bread has turned out not so good is when an ingredient has been forgotten without the yeast it wasn t quiet the same but our house smelled great,positive
for 19 99 you ll not find many knife sets i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife this set includes a long slicer utility knife one large paring knife and a 5 or 6 serrated knife the knives consist of good steel comfortable grips and are well balanced they are very sharp and sturdy i couldn t find a better set for the price i was looking for a decent utility carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set i use mine as the disposable knives for this price you won t have to worry about beating up on them and they sharpen up quickly too the red color is very festive the grips feel like silicon so they work when wet and greasy and pleasantly squish when you grip hard if you are in the market for a fine high level kitchen knife these may not fit the bill but if you are looking for good quality inexpensive knives you won t find better in this price range i paid 19 99 dec 200,positive
i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets these blankets are of really cheap quality thin mesh like texture threads get loose at the ends leaving traces of fabric everywhere i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies,negative

this delonghi bar32 espresso maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that i can find that does not have aluminum its water coffee path the boiler porta filter baskets brew group and steam wand are all stainless steel \( albeit the wand has a plastic tip \) i thought the capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta filter itself is made of aluminum \( although it does have stainless basket inserts \) and is twice the price than the delonghi bar32 it is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta filter after exiting the stainless baskets although capresso implies no in their ads,positive
the lower bowl part will last forever but the water tank lasts a month outside between the sun and cold air the plastic get weak right away and the slightest touch will crack the top i have gone through 3 of them all with exactly the same results,negative
i m a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover s delight it turned out to be my biggest nightmare it takes a lot to set it up and get it started if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place boy what a mess it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy took up way to much room on my counter i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good if not better it s small easy to run and the coffee tastes great deb in new hampshir,negative
it s a very secure for children my daughter is happy with this produc,positive
this food processor is the most powerful and quietest that i have ever used i am very impressed with the material the bowl and lid are made of the ones i have been using for the last 15 years have not been comparable in the least,positive
not the best wine opener you can buy but a great deal for the occassional wine drinker much easier to operate than the traditional corkscrew and a bargain at the 9 99 i paid,positive
fiestaware rocks the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you wouldn t normally expect to go together and they usually look great,positive
i love this honey pot the design is dainty but the pot itself is really good sized a beautiful accompaniment to the matching tea set,positive
while the water tasted better this model didn t last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place,negative
i am so disappointed with this vacuum i will say it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet but don t expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye also i have a cat so i have pet fur on my carpet and i lose a lot of hair myself and this vacuum doesn t pick any of that up i can vacuum run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair it would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet it seems to do that very well though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum shake the filter out etc because it gets clogged very fast,negative
i bought this for my cat a few months ago because he just loves playing with a laser pointer the whole concept of this toy was great but they should ve expanded their ideas a bit more for the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does i m not sure about others but most cats i know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser maybe even jump up the wall as opposed to with the bada beam that just goes in a circle reversing its direction every once in awhile my cat never avoids the laser pointer when he sees that red light he jumps right up but with the bada beam he will just sit and stare at it the whole point is so that you don t have to hold it and let the cats go crazy nope it s one thing for me to be disappointed but it s clear that my cat was more disappointed,negative
i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no brainer there s a coarse grinder for knives that are dull for most knives the fine and polishing grinder works just great if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well made knives the waring will work well i ve had good success with the waring,positive
i just got into wine a little while ago and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler but seeing as how i m anywhere near wine snob status i didn t want to spend a bunch on a set enter the riedel o glasses they were on sale great price for two glasses they arrived and i m happy with them they re sophisticated enough to be wine glasses but without the stems they re not snobby either i would have given this 5 stars but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim almost a little bubble of glass or crystal other than that they re great,positive
the product description for this is wrong there is a somewhat hidden zipper but for some inexplicable reason the lining is sewn into the cover so you can t separate the two,negative
the pots and pans were delivered very quickly to my residence the items were well packaged since we just moved into our apartment we began using them the pots and pans had sturdy construction and was relatively easy to clean the only drawback would be the lid handles those became very hot to the touch and you would need a hand towel or an oven mitt to handle it \( on a side note the lid handles are clear glass so that is definitely a plus \) overall i am quite satisfied with the purchase they were under 100 00 for the set so we are happy with it although i did not hear of the pinzon brand before i was surprised with the quality i even purchased a oven roaster w rack from pinzon as well,positive
i just started collecting fiesta ware and this yellow covered butter dish is the perfect color for a butter dish looks great on my table \( along with my red salt and papper shakers,positive
we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky our daughter now has it and is happy with it we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump it s a little too fast for what i want most of the time another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter,positive
i bought this kettle in february 2006 i liked everything about it until its automatic on off switch died recently only two months after the purchase now the kettle won t turn on it wasn t abused in any way and these kettles usually last for years and years the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique has anyone else had one with a short lived switch or was i unlucky,negative
in my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems my main beef is it s too hard to clean a few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up it has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank soaking in vinegar doesn t do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled the \( phosporic acid based \) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing and there s the hitch you can t reach parts of the element not even with a toothbrush why they couldn t center it just a little further away from the edge of the wall is beyond my comprehension i spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart trying various methods of cleaning than with it running i wouldn t buy it again,negative
using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day our family is hard on blenders after more than a year of daily experience with the waring pro \( both mbb pbb models \) i cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making here s why both glass stainless jug models use the same blade assembly this blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit it fails often and must be rebuilt or replaced parts are easily purchased if you re handy and have the correct tools details the assembly screws together and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart but this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit that it bends the metal washer below the blade the assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn the waring pro is all the blender than many people will need but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies,negative
i took water temperatures at high low and keepwarm i am at 5200 ft altitude so water boils at about 195 all temps reached 203 and the water was in a rapid boil i have a small rival i picked up for 12 and it works great low 190 high 199 and warm 160,negative

my roommate and i use this toaster daily and i ve never had problems with it the material is light but very sturdy i actually dropped it down my stairs when i moved and it still looks and works great i love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal i plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but i suspect that won t happen for quite a while,positive
ok so i thought i was crazy not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot people were making fun of me how can you burn anything in a crockpot now i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot now i know that they are not supposed to be like this do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours i am trashing mine today,negative
i know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside i took out the battery and found water in the compartment i give it as many as two stars because until the water got in it did work as advertised and seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing i m wondering if i just had a bad o ring now i m off to find a better thermometer,negative
i ve owned a littermaid mega for about 5 years and i really wish i had been able to buy this stand sooner we have two cats and we re terribly lazy we ve had this stand for a few months and it works as described it has drastically reduced the smell and the need to clean the box we love this stand and it has made life a lot more bearable when it comes to the litter box our old littermaid just died on us and we went to replace it with a new littermaid elite but the stand isn t large enough the newer elite model is much longer than this stand and it will hang off the back and over the sides we love that stand more than we want the newer littermaid elite and we are getting a great deal on the old style of the littermaid mega from amazon i would just be aware before buying this that it only fits the old style of littermaids that being said if you re handy with power tools and woodwork than you might be able to modify it it is a simple design,positive
these covers are not even close to being red the are wine or burgundy in color,negative
i purchased this item after having read about banneton in the book rustic european breads from your bread machine the picture clearly shows 4 baskets and the description is vague but you only get one the basket you get is quite small all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket it looks sturdy and well made it would have been good value for four baskets it was too much to pay for a single basket i didn t actually use it choosing instead to return it so i can t comment on how well it worked,negative
great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken amazon how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn t pack them well enough for shipping amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic i ve received two of those lovely surprises the first set i ordered and the replacement set oh boy i give up the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard they break amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement \( in this case \) so it s like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage are you feeling lucky if so then roll the dice,negative
wow this salter kitchen scales is highly accurate i always get a perfect bake everytime i definitely recommend this product you ll never be disapointed with its quality,positive
i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right,positive
they aren t kidding this thing is razor sharp it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight which is unfortunate because i like the weight for chopping but the hollow edge design is wonderful the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper and didn t stick to the blade i d recommend it,positive
twixit clips are a wonderful product they are extremely practical and very useful for all types of packages i hope you continue to carry them everyone i have given them to raves about them and wonders how they got along without them i highly recommend twixits,positive
this mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months it would work one day and then not work the next whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today no matter what the features an appliance has that rates an automatic 1 star in my book,negative
the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn t work disappointing,negative
this item did not work when i got it i returned it to zelco who informed me that it was my error they did not do refunds and returned it to me i had a previous model zelco that worked great for 10 15 years it had a switch this new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off gr,negative
this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup eliminating the scoop step it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate along with cup amounts the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on however anyways bottom line it grinds great with little mess,positive
great pot i m annoyed at having to press the unlock button everytime the one that prevents accidental spills the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes i m used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differences i m also really annoyed at the shipping bought through amazon it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in which wasn t up for the rigors of shipping but honestly i can t tell if the gaping crowbar looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no,positive
for what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months i really like foaming soap because i have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there isn t the big mess to clean but i have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap i searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and cuisipro was about all i could find but within 3 months the pump started to stick and i have to manually move it up and down it s cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick,negative
never got it to work all i get when i hit the on tare button is in the trash it goes,negative
do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over nice work guys one call to their customer service line was cut off on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back unfortunately the mailbox was full i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service,negative

i have used one crock pot or another for many years i bought this one because i was delighted with the sturdy removable stoneware bowl i really like this feature clean up is easy i use this crock pot for soups and beans because it cooks way too hot for anything else even so i need to stir from time to time apparently excessive temperature is the problem most people are having with this pot this might be a safety issue i would not keep this pot on and leave the house i am disappointed that the handle has broken off of the lid which really should not happen with normal use i lifted the lid to stir of course and off came the handle lifting the lid is definately normal use,negative

i bought this machine after researching it for a long time i could deal with the hard cleaning of it i was willing to shell out 100 00 for a good quality maker and i loved the design after two or three uses it started to leak after much searching i realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short i paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly i didn t return it i just will never buy bodum again,negative
this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing it is luke cold i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave it is hard to clean and very loud,negative

i was looking for an offset serrated knife as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill outstanding veggie slicer and all around food prep instrument even over ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights,positive

i have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the senseo coffeemaker folding filter paper didn t work too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee the quick cup sounded like a good idea but it doesn t fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee i found that the eco pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well the key to any of these re usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter the pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee the quick cup and the eco pad are essentially the same design but the eco pad fits the holder correctly and the quick cup is slightly small buy the eco pad it works the quick cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the quick cup and the holder a gasket to prevent the water from going around good luck,negative
we have some pretty nasty water from the tap but this pur filter system makes it taste so good i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once the hand held ones i ve used hold about 3 i don t know how pure the water is but it sure tastes great,positive
looks quite cheap not as good from the pictur,negative
apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new s5 series of miele vacuum cleaners the features price and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models nor even across series many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones they have fancy names like capricorn red velvet and champagne leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car if your browser has tabbed browsing \( e g firefox \) the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele s website and open a tab for each model you re interested in flip back and forth to see what text changes callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series \( newest technology motor \) that still comes with an electronically powered brush \( the 4th pisces model is turbo \) after 3 months of extensive use pros agility the 10 wide seb217 3 electric powerbrush comes standard and one of the reasons i chose this model for me smaller is better while other vacuums advertise large 13 power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe i don t have much open carpet space coffee tables chairs weight benches and computers all need vacuuming around and under the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners brush duster the most commonly used attachment \( for me \) the brush duster is also small \( slightly larger in diameter than the hose \) and the bristles are durable it s angled by default but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out this is not mentioned anywhere you just have to figure this out for yourself on low power i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk parquet floor brush initially i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included but this wider brush duster actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better on the negative side you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for genuine horse bristles there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don t get separated for life \( the powerbrush takes precedence \) cord rewind the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time something like 15 for 15 times \( the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat \) cons price after all it s just a vacuum cleaner there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s5 series at least when i bought this everywhere i checked \( maybe 10 websites \) the price was exactly 799 or 799 95 with the only difference being no tax and or free shipping one website even advertised the lowest price allowed what s a diamond dealer is this amway release buttons the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive being on the part that comes off rather than on the part that stays behind therefore you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with the hose extension button is particularly confusing it s an oval shaped rocker button that rocks very little to extend the stainless steel hose you have to remember which side of the button \( top or bottom \) to press there is no distinction on which side to press and it s always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button stiff no swivel hose the hose rotates at the top \( handle area \) but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists i d rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists the flex hose diameter is larger than i m used to making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner considering the price an electrical slip ring would have been nice bag full indicator the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full right out of the box on short carpet it indicated bag full on high power as i turned the power down it indicated less full sequentially you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator even at that there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator extra stuff the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose \( button doesn t easily click into place \) the extension isn t needed to connect the parquet brush so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it to this day i still haven t figured out what the extension is for other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life \( along with the parquet brush normal filter cage and replacement bags \) symbol marking the power symbol markings are not obvious at all contrary to claims other than the symbols labels min and max you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise the quite mode is 4 of 6 settings \( with 6 being the highest \) and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the normal operating mode i think most people will consider max the default mode optional filter frame this model comes with a hepa filter so you don t need the filter frame unless you re going to switch to the normal filters but brand new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping you don t even need the handle for the frame to function properly but for the kind of money i paid nothing should be broken out of the box the vendor that i bought it from \( best vacuum \) replaced it for free so is it worth 800 it does a good job but only time will tell,positive
this is a big saucepan i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines this has become my favorite pot for many things from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night the see through lid is great for monitoring food as it s cooking and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look and i love it,positive
works looks good fits in the fridge well enough i m happy with it,positive
i purchased the smallest version the lw 14 for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows air ionizers didn t rid the air of the frying smells but this appliance works the initial price is high but not the cost to keep the venta running water is cheap power consumption on highest setting is about 35 watt for whisper quiet use in a bedroom a lower setting is better any air con would be much louder anyways and drown out the venta on the highest setting the motor used to power the machine is indeed very silent and possible can t be manufactured for 30 the other components are ruggedly constructed and hopefully last many years the device can also be used for aromatherapy which i m just testing with some natural mint oil against my cold,positive
i have had this scale for about 4 months it worked fine the few times i used it but last night i went to use it and it has given up the ghost i swapped batteries and still nothing the connection for the 9v battery is very loose and even after crimping and holding it tight it didn t get any juice not happy so i will order a different brand and hope it does better i do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets so maybe i just got a lemon,negative

i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one the pampered chef one works better than this one however this is not a horrible product one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you can t see through this one to see how high the oil level is you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway and when it is less than 1 3 full you need to fill it back up or it won t work as well this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level it almost won t spray if the level is too low but since you can t see through it even holding it up to the light you have to look down in and estimate how high it is the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is you don t want to fill it all the way up either then you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped this one sprays a very fine spray finer than the pampered chef one and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there i think i know why my old one got clogged so i m trying something new each time i m done before i put it away i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure i think if you leave it pressured up all the time like i did with my old one it damages the nozzle over time but time will tell if i m right another tip don t fill it with anything but olive oil other oils evaporate and leave a sticky greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it olive oil doesn t do that that s why i now don t use anything else on my stovetop \( except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying \) this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it trust me but if you have a choice go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer it s cheaper and better quality,positive

i received this coffeemaker as a christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket style filter after using the maker for a week i have to say my skepticism was unjustified this machine makes great tasting coffee that is as hot as i could want it i never liked the cooked coffee that regular glass carafe makers produced burned tasting after the first cup the coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last i fill the carafe with hot water mill my beans and fill the reservoir empty the carafe and enjoy after two hours the coffee was still hot one great feature not highlighted is the front fill aspect kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front right next to the filter no more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level extremely convenient i have to disagree with the previous reviewer this machine makes ten 5 ounce cups after reading the review i double checked the carafe capacity against my old krups machine exactly 10 cups more than enough for our household all in all a great looking great performing coffeemaker that meets kitchenaid s high standards i highly recommend it,positive

this grill pan heats relatively evenly and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously it leaves nice grill marks on the food and works well overall the press that comes with it is very nice to have as it helps cook food faster however it has one major drawback it makes a very odd smell when it is used regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product i have a number of higher end calphalon non stick pans and none of them make this smell making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan bottom line if i had to do it over again i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead,negative
see other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning cool design but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press i only used this coffee maker 3 times and reverted to the press,negative
i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity cost and excellent coffee this has all three the first two or three times i tried this the coffee didn t come out that good either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day the other good news i ve now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress,positive

i have used patton air circulators for the last twenty years and if you are looking for something much more effecient than the common box fan that you see in department stores this is really a fan the first one i bought had the c f m rating on it which was 9600 they don t put that on the fan anymore but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate some air and can be adjusted to blow straight up nothing i have seen even comes close for the money,positive

this coffeemaker is a huge disappointment the stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere and if you do not use additional paper filters you get coffee grains in summary a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee the plus the water filter but that is it,negative
when i was looking to purchase a new machine i only was looking for a bunn bunn makes the best coffee machines none can compare every diner coffee house and dunkin donuts only use bunn machines the a10 is one great machine brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly everyone in my office is very happy with the unit if you re a serious coffee drinker please don t cheap out on a mr coffee braun or krupps frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed temperature or taste of a bunn unit i bought the a10 to replace a bunn unit that i used for 10 years without a glitch,positive
this is a great pan aside from the fact that it is easily the best non stick on the market \( and i have used anolon calphalon and scanpan \) what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution there are no hot spots not even the center when sauteing the food colours evenly \( even when the pan is a little overcrowded \) when stewing you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food demonstrating how even the heat distribution is this pan also makes a fine risotto oh and did i mention its non stick is simply the best clean up is a breeze nothing sticks even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan swiss diamond is the king of non stick as not only is their surface no 1 but the quality of their pans is second to none i own two swiss diamond pieces i plan to buy more and i couldn t recommend these pans more highly this is the pan i reach for the most,positive

unless you love the look of this pepper grinder i d suggest you look elsewhere when compared to a generic grinder this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds i ve gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them with this grinder you ll always get a huge variation in the grind some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable you ll have trouble turning it not recommended,negative

i ve been a chef for almost 15 years and a knife is one of the tools i reach out most of the time during those years i ve used all kinds of brands including kershaw wusthof mundial and even smart and final brand and to be more specific an 8 inch chef s knife is my favorite after having fun with these toys i thought it s time to reward myself with an ultimate gift so i sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive one day i came across the shun classic on the amazon web this knife sets itself apart from the others the simplicity in design the beauty of the blade the sharpness and finally its steel quality the blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a samurai s sword wow the d shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood it fits in my hand nicely but the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness i can slice pieces of lemons micro thin it s not only super sharp but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels i experienced with it weighs a little heavier but i m sure that s not a big deal for me cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there isn t any corner which will accumulate grease shun 8 inch classic is the best i ve ever had you won t regret what you pay for even though the price is very high a good chef deserves a good steel,positive

i ve had this coffeemaker for two weeks i bought it because i had an old mr coffee that worked fine but was white and stained i liked that this was black and looked sleek the very second time i used it the off button stuck so you can no longer turn off the machine but have to wait for it to turn itself off also every pot has grounds in it i m using the filters that came with it and have never even filled it to capacity and i can t figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee piece of junk don t buy it,negative
i checked out this machine at a local store it s little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine for that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately regarding this delonghi machine on the drip coffee side metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds on the espresso side you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make and then empty the strainer when you re done the optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee for only a bit more money \( 500 or so \) you can get a full automatic espresso cappuccino maker i bought a full automatic several years ago and my family loves it full automatics grind the beans for each cup they make excellent american style coffee as well \( simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee \) and you dispose of grounds once a week the only disadvantage of full automatics is that like every espresso machine they do only one or two cups at a time so if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once you ll need a plain old coffee maker like the right hand side of the delonghi,negative
i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up big people food for my grandson it could not even grind up a soft hot dog we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material \( painted gray to look like metal \) it just couldn t do the job sheesh i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder total waste of money also my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two junk,negative

got this tea kettle for a gift recently it s discontinued on amazon but they sell it at home goods for 24 99 pros asthetically pleasing \( looks pretty \) removable top for wide area to fill with water and makes it easier to wash removable whistle \( i can t stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle so i remove the plug \) cons it d be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up plug on the spout instead of the removable one \( i ll lose it eventually the other le creuset models have the flip up plug that opens with a press of the thumb \) the poor design of the spout is dangerous no matter how slowly i pour the boiling water \( even with the small amount i use only 4 or 6 ounces at a time \) a few tablespoons of water blub out very quickly sorry i can t think of a better descriptive word the spout opening is way too small but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water so the first few tablespoons gush out so when you pour the water do it as slowly as possible put the mug on your counter or another surface that won t get ruined when wet and don t hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the blub of boiling water will burn,negative

i have used this vacuum for over a year now i consistently have trouble with the belts staying on i cannot count the number of times i ve had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts if it even rolls over something uneven on the floor the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving also although bagless sounded great this vacuum is very very messy to clean out i have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere it also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments i write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached i have taken this vacuum apart for the last time,negative

the other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have it pales in comparison to my old hamilton beach however in several respects well really one big one it s a plastic object and it gets very hot too hot hot enough that it smells like it s melting itself i got this as a gift rinsed it thorougly boiled a pot just to clean it and it stunk like melted plastic ran it again to try and get the smell out same thing rinsed it with cold water and tried again still melted odor the outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off \( a problem i didn t have with my previous kettle which i lost in a move \) and when i touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger you can bet i put this right in the mail back to amazon i normally would hesitate to return a gift but i d rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust,negative

i have been using these filters for years my first impression with them is that they are very expensive my second impression is that they might not work as well as i thought they did i recently bought a water distiller and i have been experimenting with different sources of water in it i have used hot water directly from the tap cold water directly from the tap and brita filtered water in the distiller the brita filtered water left the most residue in the distiller which is very disconcerting the filters let out small amounts of carbon all the time into the top of their proprietry resevoir in the directions it says to slowly add water to the filtering well which is what i do but it still leaches at least thirty little pieces of carbon in the prefiltered water i want clean water not water with small pieces of carbon floating in the filling well i have always wanted to believe the filters were working but now am very skeptical,negative

once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and i will get a half of a pot of coffee the big problem with this piece of junk that the coffee maker was under a cabinet and the steam was ruining the kitchen cabinet i say this is 199 down the drain i have never had problems with a coffee maker spitting steam out the back and no water dripping into the pot stay away from this garbage i am not even interested in contacting krups for any warranty repair because it is not worth it,negative
i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully,positive
my kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40 my wife and i limit their exposure when we can an example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye recently they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle we figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers the ability to make jerky was a bonus for me i ordered another brand that i thought was going to do the job but once it arrived i found the construction to be subpar and it was passive requiring rotation of the trays i immediately sent it back to amazon thats when i ordered this nesco unit it is powerful and effective i have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers i have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them order this and you can t go wrong,positive

i bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor s mutt the offending dog is often left on the neighbor s porch where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by before ordering i had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect in my case the neighbor s porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine unfortunately this was not too close for comfort as far as the dog was concerned having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices i was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working alas it did not some dogs just don t hear them in my case it was probably due at least in part to the distance my suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20 of the target if it doesn t work go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund \( which is exactly what i did \) by the way you don t need an ra \( aka rma \) number to return the device just send it to the company along with your receipt and a note saying that you would like a refund \( not an exchange \) \( \) i sympathize with anyone having this problem and wish you all the best of luck no one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason and the argument that dogs bark simply does not hold any water,negative
i bought this set after the recent issues with teflon i did my research on all non teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may \( key word here is may \) contribute to alzheimer s \( according to some \) and the stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods both of which i am allergic too pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive a good set of a few items are 600 there are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by corning pyrex called visionware \( also known as visions \) that can be found on ebay \( and a few are left here on amazon \) as they are no longer in production finally there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternatives the items have been great so far however you will really want to do some research in google \( or any other search engine \) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really shouldn t do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water \( it will crack or break \) etc in addition you will also want to so some research on how to season them which makes them very close to being non stick \( you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and bake the pans for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit \) i did this and i just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick teflon pan but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan the downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you cannot stick the pan into the dishwasher \( and i tried it will come out a little bit rustier but the little rust does come off very easily \) the sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me so i think i will buy one more in a larger size the upsides are price no chemicals \( except for some iron \) in your food easy to care for and very non stick when seasoned this is a great starter set,positive

this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it doesn t create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one,negative
great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice you have to spray the pan really really well with cooking spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the cornbread to come out in one piece i run a little spatula around the edges before i dump the pan gave one as a gift at christmas and it was a hit,positive

it is a very lovely two piece set and amazon shipped it to me twice and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards i gave up but from what i could tell from the remains this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear i m not sure considering the shipping problems whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher,negative
i bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working i find it easy to insert the cans it works great if you follow the directions it s not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink it s a good buy,positive
i m certainly glad to have this pointer you d never know it is inexpensive since it looks quite sleek \( like a fountain pen though heavier for sure \) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance pleasantly sensitive to the touch it needs no fussing you d have to have pretty specialized needs to want a more expensive model,positive

after reading reviews on the wok s available on amazon com i decided on this wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher but it is very easy to hand clean the non stick surface has lasted but i am careful to only use plasic or wood and i wash it with a cloth and soap it gets to temperature quickly during cooking the only complaint i have is the simmer cycles \( not a constant heat but on and off \) i purchased some thai cook books \( real thai and thailand the beautiful cook book \) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a wok how easy it is to prepare my favorite food the difference the wok made i was able to cook at the correct temperatures my stove btu is apparently quite low it took forever to sizzle so the food turned to mush before it was cooked i now use the wok for anything i want to cook fast and or warm up,positive

we have an aussie healer mix \( we think she was a foundling \) with a thick soft coat i ve had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at 60 to 75 a pop so last summer i decided to try it myself with this clipper kit to make a long story short she didn t turn out so bad \( well the neighbors didn t laugh anyway \) it took me a while to get the hang of it i finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers but she didn t complain and i had a cool dog for much less than a pro cut the best part was i could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back no report as yet how long the blades last but i m already money ahead even if i must replace them next year,positive
this is an incredibly beautiful knife with an excellent weight well balanced the damascus steel is just so nice my husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative this is our third expensive kitchen knife and i would say that in terms of general use meat to vegetables this is my second favorite with my large 8 henckel being my best knife the shun is much nicer than the wusthof prix ii which sports the comparable santoku shape my complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle making this a much better knife for filleting motions of which i do few it s marketed toward general chopping and slicing but i find that slant makes my cuts less precise it s still my husband s favorite but since i m the one who does the majority of the cooking i d still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands but it s a real marvel to behold and i love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel,positive

being used to the swiftness of the roomba \( 10 stars \) the scooba seems very slow it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle the floor is clean and sweet smelling on the downside my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine,positive

i am not a coffee connoisseur so my criteria for a good coffee maker is probably modest i bought the ka javastudio because i own several ka appliances and have always been pleased although the ka 10 cup is pricey i felt that buying a thermal carafe represented an upgrade from my previous glass carafe i also figured that the wide spray mechanism might mean a richer cup of coffee i did as much research as i could reading reviews and looking at available coffee makers in my area after trying out our new ka yesterday my husband and i were both disappointed in its functionality and performance here are some points to consider about this product 1 the ka 10 cup makes 4 1 4 oz cups in other words if you re looking for 8 ounce servings the most this will make is about 5 real cups of coffee 2 the thermal carafe is heavy if you re planning on keeping this on your counter and possibly under a cabinet it is a tug to pull it out each time you use it to pour water in the back 3 there is no way to figure out the water level in the tank the directions say to use the optional white water filter insert 4 for us at least taste wise there is no discernible difference between what the ka brewed and what we ve tolerated with our old coffee maker good luck with your search for a more perfect coffee maker,negative

i could not resist trying this method of making espresso you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have there are a few tricks with the frother \( 1 milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile \) the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon pump it quickly and serve regarding the espresso maker itself just don t add any more water than to that line and oh don t open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done very quick and yummm,positive
you may as well put your betta in a glass of water the argument is that bettas are naturally found in rice paddies in thailand go ahead and google images of a rice paddy bettas can live in small areas due to a special lung that lets them breathe air directly humans can live in cars but should they and the tiny stick of bamboo is a joke adding insult to injury they have nothing to retreat or hide behind at all in this kit bettas were not put on this earth to make your office pretty if you want a betta get them a proper tank,negative
do your banana s turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them this used to be a huge problem in my house but now that i have the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger this is no longer an issue i hang my bananas up the moment i get home from the grocery store they think they are still on the tree out in the wild silly bananas green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer once i got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger is compact and doesn t take up much counter space which is a definite plus and it s almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display,positive

i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone the coffee does taste funny and i didn t realize it might be the metal pot also do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out just like one of the other reviewers said the pot does not slide in and out easily not a coffeemaker i would recommend the only thing i like about it is the size,negative
not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust it is really useful on those thick pizzas like spinach and feta plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board i almost never use it for any non pizza cooking and a heavy sharp knife works almost as well however it s a fun item and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza i definitely recommend it,positive

as everyone else has indicated programming isn t intuitive the opening was larger than necessary and my cats learned to stick their paws up inside the machine to steal more food within a few days we blocked off half of the food shute by using two very small screws and heavy duty plastic and the cats were no longer able to sneak food between feedings prior to using this feeder the cats would wake us up at the crack of dawn crying for food now they associate feedings with the machine and leave us to sleep in peace well worth the money for us,positive
i was shopping in a gift store today and came across this tovolo tea infuser and it is brillant if you don t use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain this will spoil you it stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it doesn t drip on anything and the whole thing is dishwasher safe i paid more than 9 95 for mine too,positive

the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan,negative
poor carafe design makes this mr coffee machine a waste of money we bought this model to replace our old mr coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn t purchase a replacement for that model we loved our old mr coffee but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because as other reviewers have noted it s virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee water everywere after the first few uses we decided to purchase a different coffee maker,negative

i have really nice dansk everyday dishes but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use i have to admit these dishes are really stylish they look great on the table are very lightweight stack very compactly and are a nice large size the only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls they are small and while they look really cool the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around if you re looking for bigger bowls for cereal you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that corelle makes for salads the square ones work just fine a word of pricing caution on amazon at this moment they are 69 a set i bought mine for 49 per set at my local walmart,positive

i ve been using spiegelau wine glasses for several years and they are excellent the bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine these glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine \( they re also not bad for rhones though i prefer the reidel vinum syrah glass \) if you drink a lot of burgundy or pinot noir or italian piedmont wines \( barolo barbaresco langhe \) i d suggest spiegelau s burgundy glass if your preference is zinfandel or chianti you re a bit out of luck with spiegelau however their chianti glass isn t very good try the riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines you ll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet some reviewers have complained about breakage i ve seldom broken a glass but it does occasionally happen during washing my method is to clear the sink run the water as hot as possible put a bit of dishsoap in each glass i then use a special ultra soft brush \( which i got at a local wine shop for about 6 \) to clean the glass removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim then rinse thoroughly with very hot water invert on cloth after about half an hour with the glasses almost dry you can wipe them off with paper towels \( which don t leave any lint behind \) and put them away the main thing is never to lay them down in the sink and wash one glass at a time just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you re doing don t try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying just use the paper towels finally even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe i don t know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher dishwashers always leave a film and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses which lose their clarity as a consequence,positive

this was one pattern that both my wife and i could agree on the design is clean and interesting and should fit with most decors i purchased two of the 16 piece sets from amazon for set and with the free vegtable bowles no tax and free shipping this was by far the best deal on the internet my first set arrived with two broken salad plates and one broken dinner plate my second set arrived with one broken salad plate the repacement set arrived with one broken salad plate the vegtable bowles arrived intact the quality seems to be first rate no warped plates or design flaws but a few item did have some minor cosmetic flaws amazon was great at resolving the damaged goods issues but needs to seriously rethink the packaging of fragile items the only fault i could find with this set is that the soup bowles are a little on the small side i recommend that you read and following the cleaning and maintenance directions and this set should give many years of service,positive
i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and doesn t take a lot of counter space while you are using it its the perfect size to make pancakes eggs and bacon we used it to make grilled cheese and they came out perfect this would be great for singles college students and anyone who likes great things in small packages,positive

bought this vacuum because consumer reports picked it as one of the 2006 best buys better than dyson or rainbow this is our second eureka but this one is significantly better than the last the last was a bagless model and this one uses bags and as a result it s much easier to clean bags are quite inexpensive so it only adds about 10 15 per year \( 6 9 bags \) suction is fantastic noise is low it s easy to use and i will add that we purchased a refurbished model but we can identify no defects or differences looks perfectly new and runs great so the choice is yours dyson for 400 or this one which is better for 99,positive

my mother in law and i both had this blender hers broke in a couple of months i was lucky that mine lasted a couple of years it is a great blender for crushing ice for smoothies icees etc however it has a flaw that the piece that the pitcher sits on when it spins is made out of plastic it eventually cracks from the heat friction produced i bought the oster beehive blender to replace it and it has a metal piece beneath it and i have had it for a few years now with no problem i am even happier with the oster beehive blender as it is a much better quality blender which will last a lot longer than the cuisinart one \( it was also cheaper \) and it crushes ice exactly as good if not better than the cuisinart blender,negative
first off i paid 25 00 for this at walmart so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for 54 00 secondly it works fine for the amt of money i spent thirdly my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it i will have to put ear plugs in seriously this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm i have an email in to eureka com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to,negative
no stars i recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated but due to the leaking issues w the filter basket overflowing you may also notice that the water never completely drains staying at the 2 cup line causing mold milldew to grow \( despite proper cleaning maintenance \) this is the reason for the bad tasting coffee also the reason for my current various medical conditions i am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues i am being faced with please do not purchase any mr coffee sunbeam products this is the exact model i own but nearly every model has the same defective construction consumer complaints check the better business bureau consumer affairs you will be shocked at what you find about mr coffee sunbeam they have almost gone bankrupt from class action lawsuits more than once if anyone has a similar situation with any mr coffee brand coffee makers please contact me asap my email address is angidougherty yahoo com people are suffering because of this hazardous product may not even know it toxic mold poisoning is very serious can be deadly especially through drinking it in your morning coffee yum,negative

i say nearly useless because the ceramic pot is a nice size and weight for melting chocolate in the microwave \( which is what you ll have to do \) and the warmer makes a decent trivet but it does not ever get hot enough to actually melt the chocolate we followed the directions and allwed 1 2 hour for the chocolate to melt \( putting chips in as we started dinner \) half an hour later some of the chocolate \( on the outside of the crock by the burner coil \) had melted a bit an hour passed still nothing much now given that cocoa butter melts at body temperature \( which is why it is used in cosmetics \) that s saying something the pot never reached 98 degrees if i d put the chips in a zip lock in my lap during dinner i would have had better results since this was a relatively inexpensive item and i got it effectively for free during amazon s recent valentine s day promotion i did not send it back \( thinking it would be unfair to make them pay shipping both ways on an item which costs near as much to ship as it does to buy \) but if you are actually paying for this don t bother \( or at least be advised that it will not actually melt the chocolate \) it does do a reasonable job of holding the temperature once you ve melted the chocolate some other way,negative
this was a special offer and the price seemed excellent description stated standard classic white goose down feather pillow a more accurate description would have been mostly feather pillow with some goose down skimpily filled i would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate i e larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content as they did with other catalog items i believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was caveat emptor,negative
i loved this blender while it was working i mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit i love that it has seamless buttons so food can t get caught in little cracks i rarely used the food processor after about 11 months mine also started to smell like it was catching fire however it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar which was basically being shaved by the base motor i had to order a replacement blender cutting assembly from the cuisinart website for 15 with shipping only to have it happen again plus it was a pain to clean the base threading didn t match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult we ve replaced the blender with another brand but i have kept the bottom motor part for the processor,negative
this looks like a good idea from westinghouse but if you read the warranty details the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10 year warranty 10 00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years but not really what is the point extra tape isn t even included when the first strip fails i suggest you use a flashlight,negative

i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money,negative

the machine looks great it sat nicely on our counter top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy if that was all i wanted to do with it then i would have been very happy with it but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos firstly i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use it rotates but has little movement up or down as a result i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter top when i was finished it produced good foam though secondly the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not finally the espressos i made had no crema at all i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere in summary if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter buy this machine if you want to make decent espresso based drinks don t,negative
i love that it has a mini bowl so much less storage also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach i am so impressed love kitchen aid anything,positive
ok well unlike the other reviewers i hate this ice cream scoop yes it s heavy and seems to be well engineered however i don t like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it and as another reviewer already mentioned it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed when i m scooping the ice cream the water drips out and down the handle thus making it even harder to grip the handle it makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and i get ice cream all over my hand i have a cheap 2 plastic scoop that i bought when i was in college and i prefer it to this one,negative

the problem with this is that \( as it appears to me \) villaware has tried to cut corners by re using all but the plates as it has on it s panini grill \( which for the record is an excellent product which i have given rave reviews \) check out the panini grill unless you had these products in front of you were able to open them up you d never be able to tell the difference between them i would say don t write off villaware products just because of one poor one as i said i also own the panini grill love it however don t waste your money on this one i hope villaware does right by their respected name pulls this off the market completely one thing i will say the audible warning sound that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click the same as the panini grill but listen carefully or you ll miss it,negative

it s true you have to put the whole silly thing together yourself but that is why it is the price it is once put together it is lightweight and easy to move to where you want it i recommend putting it together on a hard surface we used a piece of plywood when you try to put it together on carpet the mallet doesn t enough force to make it work right,positive
this mug absolutely comes through as promised hot beverages stay hot even hours later it s totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning i am very pleased with this purchase the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it s size i would have preferred something a little wider but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for unfortunately it tends to move around in mine but it doesn t spill any thing,positive
i destroy cooking pots i m especially lethal to the light weight teflon lined variety you ll find at the supermarket my secret is simple i like to cook on high heat and i get easily distracted that guarantees that i ll forget what s on the stove and produce a scorched \( and warped \) utensil if a lightweight teflon pot lasts me two years it s extraordinarily lucky i now own four \( different \) swiss diamond pots and even my brutal habits leave them unimpressed despite regular disasters they seem to shrug off what would vanquish a lesser pot \( admittedly i do avoid metal spoons and spatulas and clean them with non abrasive means \) they have excellent non stick characteristics superb heat spreading and love it are approved for very hot oven use adding up to essential cooking tools and when you factor the price of regularly replacing cheaper pots their cost becomes more than bearable highly recommended,positive

when trying to decide if this model \( 3670g \) was the right vacuum for me i found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it s features on the internet and from the manufacturer itself first of all many online retailers flat out state \( inaccurately \) that this model has a hepa \( high efficiency particulate air \) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on amazon \( at least as of this writing \) seems to indicate that it has one as well i can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does not have a hepa filter more on that a little later in this review however i found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number \( i e 3670g \) be careful to understand the difference between what amazon calls the 3670 \( also called the 3670a in some places \) and the 3670 g models they look identical and appear to be identical \( both are yellow and black \) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670g has the larger 12 amp motor amazon carries both models and i almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum for only about a 5 10 difference in total price i m not sure why the smaller version is even offered it only seems to confuse the matter the 3670 also does not have the hepa filter incidentally i found the 3670g to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase it is compact very powerful and great for my needs the noise while high is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans the generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful not having one is a reasonable trade off in keeping the price down the blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides \( by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing \) the 3670g does require bags it is not a bagless model however and while some may prefer a bagless model i preferred a model that used bags the bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what i consider to be the additional convenience \( of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag \) the only reason i gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because i did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate three attachment tools are included a crevice tool a 10 floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly shaped brush \( about 2 wide \) on the end the combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick up \( 3 wide \) in my opinion this cleaner badly needs a mid sized brush and or pick up tool that is about 4 5 wide the 2 wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2 wide i found that i simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces \( such as a wall for example \) in order to cover the area needed i would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4 5 wide had been included as it is i am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra finally a comment about the hepa filter some people \( particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air \) may want cleaners that include this item in my case i did not want this since i don t need it and hepa filters can be quite expensive to change and replace \( unless you get a washable one also expensive \) since many online descriptions i found were unclear whether the 3670g included this filter \( some descriptions flatly stated that it does \) i found myself calling the eureka customer service number to find out for sure it turned out that even eureka s own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn t have one if you do want the hepa filter you would want the 3684d which looks the same but is red in color slightly more expensive and has more and better quality attachments as well as the hepa filter by the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment \( which i mentioned earlier that i think is needed on the 3670g \) you are at the price of a 3684d in that case the 3684d may well be a better value for you particularly if you like the hepa filter overall i think the boss series of canister vacuums is a great product eureka \( and amazon as well \) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however,positive
yes it is pretty no it is not a good teapot i have made tea for over 40 years in all sorts of pots and this is right up there with the worst it drips a lot perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout and no it does not drip from the spout rather lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot this happens with both fast and slow pouring with full and near empty pots this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot just too much mopping up,negative

i was lucky to get the stainless popper on clearance it is wonderful we have used it for several months now it is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn i am so disappointed that target is not carrying the stainless model anymore my college children who don t live at home want their own even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan i m sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models when i bought mine i chose stainless because i knew it could handle the high heat well and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher hey target how about carrying the stainless model again,positive
i bought this when my air popper died i am so glad i found this product the popcorn is the best it is very simple to make the thing i like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn i can choose which oil to use how much so i have total control over what goes into my popcorn so i feel confident that what i am eating is good for me the packaged corn that came with was ok a good introduction to using the popper but i will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own i did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book it was fantastic i would recommend this to anyone the popper is easy to handle easy to clean it makes the best crisp crunchy popcorn ever it only takes about 3 minutes to be done you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings sometimes simple old fashioned is better that is the case with this item now we can t wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night,positive

well i have a toy poodle and he goes crazy when he hears someone at our door we live in a tiny studio in nyc so if he hears someone going into their apt in the middle of the night he goes crazy and wakes everyone up after a lack of sleep and total frustration i got this collar it work until one night i woke up to horrible noises when i saw that my dog had attempted to slip the collar off and because of all his fur the collar was able to slide partially off but not all the way leaving the electric part in his mouth and when he whined it electrocuted his mouth so i quick unhooked it and couldnt stop freaking out so my boyfriend said that its not a bad shock its just a quick pinched so i tryed it on my neck and my god was it powerful it burned and paralyzed your whole area i made my boyfriend try it to just so he couldnt say i was being a p ssy we threw it right out after that i didnt even want to resell it or get my money back because i would feel too guilty giving it to anyone else my suggestion is that you get just a sound correction device with no electric correction because i learned first hand its really not humane or a spray collar that shoots out a spray of citranella or something,negative

i used this pan just this morning and i really like it it has a great non stick surface and is easy to clean the price is great also the only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle it slants downward instead of upward so if you have a flat surface stovetop your pan won t sit flat on the surface i have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me i didn t notice this from the picture and the descriptions don t mention this but i think it is important to know who knows maybe i got a defective pan and don t know it other than that it is a great pan for the money i like it more than other non stick pans i have had,positive
i ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before but the picture on the site and the product review looked good when i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped the pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished i returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time,negative

this stone is very functional works well and goes from oven to table because of its beauty if you ve never cooked on stone before prepare to be amazed it s a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust i also use the stone for baking french fries and other stuff just put the pan directly on the stone and your food will be done faster with use your stone will discolor this happens with any stone you also should not wash any stone with soap use hot water and a plastic scraper to clean this is the only all clad product i have that i can t get the stainless to sparkle like new i think it s because i left it in the oven so much the pizza cutter that comes with this is the best i ve ever used because of its size this product is great as a bake and serve occasional baking stone if you bake a ton i suggest getting a larger stone and just leaving it the oven all the time,positive
i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces needless to say it s useless this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last,negative

i have a lot of low voltage lights on our house many colors and different wattages which i dearly love unfortunately the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights one night i used my panasonic vacuum \( which i love \) and got over 30 the motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag i ve never had one survive nice jolly subject right often i have to hold the vacuum in one hand \( 20 lbs \) while using the hose with attachment in the other this gives me over 3 ft of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is gone within 1 of the brush ok the lentek is rechargeable doesn t have a power cord and is lite \( albeit unwieldly \) after charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1 8 spider but nothing larger after a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you won t get anything then yes i m back to the panasonic and the lentek the round file,negative
i ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback we followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee after that the machine said ventilate we followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself went to make another cup of coffee and it said ventilate this time it would not fix itself i tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray turn off the knob and ventilate comes back up on the screen turn the machine off and turn it back on ventilate came up on the screen we called amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later \( thank you amazon \) unfortunately this one i did not get cup one out of the machine it read ventilate as soon as i turned it on the difference is with this one no water would come out at all gaggia provides no customer support so you are on your own with this unit,negative

i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities its so light about nine pounds and easy to transport and store its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum they are very easy to get at and change its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors along baseboards and on stairways not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool many third party vacuum attachments would work with it too i am glad i bought it and would recommend it its the vacuum i would use most the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done push a button and the cord automatically rewinds whats not to like about this vacuum highly recommended,positive

beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews,negative

when my krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service i decided to order the capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted cool grind i wish i had ordered the krups instead the capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee and the design ensures that no matter how careful you are you will spill ground coffee all over your counter in the time since i bought it another reviewer has reported that his or her capresso broke within six months do not buy this model,negative
not too happy with this small pizza stone before i ordered this one for a long time i had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking i couldnt find these bricks again i had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now but they were so much better than this small round stone my bricks made my pizza crust so crispy and this stone is a poor substitute for this my bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf if anyone knows what i am writing about pls email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name i am not happy with this pizza set the rack is of no use the pizza cutter is a cheap one they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras,negative

i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i d buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one,negative
i previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal so i bought these as replacements the previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal the rubber sections on these are so thin that they didn t even seal the wine bottle i first tried them on all three stoppers in the set had the same problem oxygen and leakage are death to a wine so a stopper that doesn t seal is worse than just replacing the cork,negative

i purchased this in cobalt blue it goes with my fiestaware dishes as well as my pzaltsgraf and longerberger pottery i also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful and much nicer in person than online it has a large capacity and pleasing lines i ll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals to be able to use more than one,positive

we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender the cuisinart took care of the problem pros very good power for blending good battery charge life easy to clean clever modular construction \( battery separates from motor built in plug and charger \) does not roll off counter cons larger and heavier than the corder braun this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 long the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth making clean up easy i don t recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft hand washing is easy and quick one reviewer suggested that cuisinart s recommendation of leaving the battery pack charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries this may shorten the battery life but the charger charges them at a very slow rate this protects the batteries from what really damages them heat from fast charging as the charger draws only 1 watt of current some may want to leave it plugged in continuously current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power don t run them down completely as was the practice in the past the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight they don t feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life,positive
i would not recommend purchasing these sheets they are thin not very soft and they wrinkle easily,negative

i am not fond of this particular microwave because of the loud clunky sound of the door opening poor in my opinion i can t believe that i will probably put up with this for years as i use my microwave several times a day my husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input like power buttons in the upper left corner most used buttons should be large maybe in a special color i like the web 2 0 look that is developing on user interfaces no user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought i asked my husband what was the brand name and he said sharp so even if cheap i think sharp ought to protect the brand image but i see that i am in the minority of opinions here maybe my advice is not order on line till you try this item out,negative
i bought these for a wonderful craft i was expecting them to be decent but i did not expect them to be as nice as they were if i realized how nice they were then i would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping i realize that i got 100 bags but my craft took about 75 of them they are nicer than the piping icing bags that i used while i was learning cake decorating when these are gone i will definitely order more the plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out,positive

this was given to us about last christmas to replace our old one not worth it a couple months into our ownership of this item it stopped working properly the right burner remains on at all times we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off so the right burner remains on hi all the time and the left burner is either lo or hi there is no concept of temperature control with this device if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things if it s a centimeter above medium it s hot if you want medium heat to work good luck it worked ok until it broke however it was never especially powerful i can t even tolerate trying to cook with it anymore i just go to the apartment downstairs and cook on my boyfriend s mom s gas stove for nice even heating but a ministove that they are dubbing professional should not be breaking after like three months,negative
this is wonderful i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me i actually enjoy working with this the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer but using really good litter and not too much of it stops that i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this,positive
i ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic however this kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water i boiled it a few times plus tried the water vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help i decided that i didn t want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so i m returning it it s not worth the risk i can t figure out if it s coming from the stainless steel bulb \( that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it \) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass the bulb plus the lid has a stong odor too that is plastic covered in stainless steel,negative

read the fine \( or missing \) print carefully this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets \( another 100 \) if you want to return this item they charge a restocking fee of 10 and also deduct for the shipment \( even if you got free shipping \) and you pay to ship the thing back we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores which is where the miele came from,negative
very nice warm blanket but too big for a full size bed way too big,positive
bought this set at target 3 years ago for 200 and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them they re heavy cooked things well and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil \( metal etc \) in them that didn t belong in them took care when washing didn t burn things in them etc somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement because i didn t want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating they had to go straight to the trash very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life with high care and high cost the 2nd star is because they are beautiful and i cooked every day with these if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these they might work for you for me stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go i wouldn t even try another non stick finish,negative

my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st amazingly i would have bought it after reading the reviews here i m starting to wonder who writes these things lg employees the microwave is fine no complaints the toaster however is an unmitigated disaster i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances this appliance is a poster child for this thought the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently \( sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10 \) more importantly the toaster broke after 31 days \( coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named ricky managing the store what can you expect \) lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty the problem is they can t think outside of the box they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up ok no problem one day later it breaks again it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not that s how bad it was lg will not budge have it repaired again \( great option costs lg money me more travel time and it won t do the job \) or do a rebate the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product huh so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace \( they admitted they don t have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new \) and then don t stand behind your product you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here our we so bad as a manufacturer that we can t top this their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this you can cal korea but they won t change their policy they said i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same shame on you lg you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me,negative

my wife and i are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats though the catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with sanisolution and granules it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement unfortunately they just don t work becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 catgenies even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly they clogged everytime and beeped incessantly another problem is the scoop even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle it always left turds behind those turds would then go through the whole cyle which includes drying that means that even if they re scooped up the next time it cycles they re going to be so dry and hard they ll never be ground up properly again this results in clogs we had them for a little over 2 weeks in that time we had to run extra cyles backflush and even take them apart and clean them this product results in far more work not less,negative

i got a set of 8 a few months ago first one package arrived with a broken one then all of them ended up broken they break if you fill them with water and try to take them by the side they break if you set them a little too fast on the table one of them broke by just holding it such poor quality i am extremely disapointed but i loved the design though,negative
having had a hoover in the past i was excited to find this one at this price i ve had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again and will not be looking at hoovers the parts are plastic and cheap and break easily it advertised a power hand tool it is not it works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning the upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months the hard wood floor tool worked fine and suction was strong enough but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments don t stay on like they should so i spend most of my time with the vacuum re attaching the pieces i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last,negative

i am glad i only paid 60 for this i see it s now up to 90 i am a bit disappointed in this purchase it does slice well so far \( although i haven t tried slicing anything really thin like prosciutto yet \) but i don t like the fact that i have to hold the on button down with one hand while cutting i also found that when i used it to slice homemade bread that the slices get stuck in between the blade and the plastic guide at the bottom so i have to stop and dislodge each slice sometimes tearing them in the process i also don t like how loud it is and the fact that it sounds like it is working really hard all the time it makes me question how long the motor is going to last the catch tray is really useless \( as someone else pointed out \) and in addition to not doing it s job it doesn t store inside or attached to the machine in any way so it just kind of gets in the way if i decide to keep the machine i am going to throw it away so all in all i gave it two stars because it is a cheap slicer \( or at least it was at 60 i am not so sure at 90 \) but it works like a cheap slicer too so you are definitely getting what you pay for,negative

i got this pan because i ve been coveting all clad when reading reviews of high end cookware and because of the low price i figured that the low price made it a teaser something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line it s a nice pan but limited on the good side it s hefty has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove heats evenly and holds the heat it is not non stick so i use it when i want the contents to produce the fabled brown bits that come up with deglazing stuff sticks unless you use a lot of fat as noted by other reviewers it does not have a pouring spout the rim is squared off so the pouring stream tends to be very wide my other major gripe is that it does not have a lid all clad lids are pricey like everything else in their line i sometimes use a cheap tempered glass lid with it i still covet all clad pans but not as much as i did before,positive

this is the most amazing knife i have ever owned i ve purchased henckles twinstars sabatier which is pure junk out of all the knives ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives i enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives i have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all global this is quite a bold move as i consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where i must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know i do not want to live without i simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and henckles twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a pandora s box of spending it actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other i must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the excaliber of knives,positive
i have been using a chemex 10 cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee there is a downside to this coffee maker it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently the first time i tried to use mine i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever the big time consumers you have to boil your water separately \( you do have a water kettle right \) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex this means that while the coffee is brewing you are pouring or watching or giving the filter area a bit of a stir now the up side you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee i use filtered water freshly ground home roasted beans and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking and this coffee is a pleasure in fact i ve totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide another up side clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new try that with your electric drip machine ha that thing will never look brand new oh here s a final upside this chemex brews the best coffee you ll ever drink and it costs less than just about anything you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks go ahead and buy yourself one of these if necessary wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee better yet wake up 20 minutes earlier and when your coffee is ready instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes you deserve it update it s been a year now and i still love this chemex however over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use nothing i tried got it clean but something my wife tried did a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing now my chemex looks brand new,positive
i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i d kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them aren t great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they re pretty but not very functional,negative
when i adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago two of my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter here s why this fresh step premium clay cat litter is excellent for your favorite kitty s litter box the company states that it is very good at absorbing odors and by golly it s true the odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat moreover i really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box that s a plus for any cat lover if you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend not surprisingly that you use more cat litter in the box otherwise if you have just one cat two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine you should change the entire litter box once a week on average \( i change mine about twice a week just for my cat s comfort \) it s also a good idea to scoop out any kitty remains every other day or so be very certain not to flush any kitty presents down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this i suppose it could clog toilet pipes moreover as you may suspect any kitty leftovers could have some nasty germs that we don t want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any kitty presents with a scooper the fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any kitty presents thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box nevertheless i recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage in short this is a great cat litter product at a great price the contents of the bag last a long time especially if like me you have only one cat the manufacturer also offers customers \( us not the cats \) an awards program with points that you can accumulate in your account with the company on the company internet website a nice plus ok fresh step i thank you my father and mother thank you and most importantly my cat says thank you smiles,positive
after reading the other reviews i almost reconsidered my purchase however the juicer works great as long as you follow a few tips 1 \) make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on tight check once then check again 2 \) don t use the paper filters particularly if you are juicing in quantity once i threw mine in the trash the balancing issues went away immediately it makes clean up a little harder but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use it s not a big deal 3 \) if the item being juiced won t go through be patient and pulse push it in don t cram it with the pusher my only concern is that when you juice quantities so much pulp sticks to the side it s hard for all of the juice out to strain out it s best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice using the above tips i expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time,positive

about a month ago a friend gave me her gf tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen in return i grilled up some home made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper i really love this grill even though it s got a big surface area it s no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away and it cleans really easily my tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm the charred stuff wipes right off i wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles like the smaller g5 version does just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby i do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage though given its size bottom line i d highly recommend this grill especially if you re using it for a family of four or more,positive
i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store it sucks wonderfully don t get me wrong the reason why it s got to be returned to targetland is because of 1 the noise 2 the dust that flies out of the dust cup when you re emptying it the noise is certainly the loudest i ve ever heard on a vacuum cleaner but i thought hey that s okay if you want to be noisy until i ventured into cleaning the stairs there s not much of an extension between the cleaning wand brush and the actual machine so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris \( what have you \) from the stairs carpet i had the crazy noise blasting turbo style directly into my ear \( this was done 15 minutes ago and my ear still hurts \) the other problem i ve found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup i am having to actually touch dirt and dust \( the entire outside of the cup is coated with it \) while pouring the dirt into the trash can a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor nasty and what s the point in the dust cup if this happens i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently \( it died after 2 1 2 years \) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup nor falling to the floor so alas my friends i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store mayhaps i ll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags \( you know the old fashioned kind \),negative

although it doesn t mention it these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150 i had to email hamilton beach to find out but they were very helpful and responded right away when the filters arrived from amazon i saw that on the box it says fits models 04160 04161 04150 with our cat and houseful of antiques we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around i run this model in our office under the table which holds the computer since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job the regular settings can be louder than expected but i leave them on the whisper quiet setting when we re in that room and i don t even notice them being on i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners,positive

the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter but traveling i would use the batteries don t make this mistake,negative

i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances the item itself works pretty good for the most part the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it to remedy the issue i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place i m not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find i used search terms like mini trash can counter top trash can small waste basket small stainless steel trash can but none of these got me to this item i m not sure how my husband finally found it,positive

i love the large size of these tumblers as i can get a whole can of pop with ice in them the thermal feature works good the ice lasts longer and they don t sweat so i don t need coasters under them they are colorful so each guest can have their own color no mix ups they fit on the top rack of my dishwasher and they don t seem to be marked or scratched yet after seeing mine my daughter in law got some as did two sets of my friends i am so glad to have found them,positive
the knife is constructed well as pictured does not cut very well it just was not very sharp i tried mincing some vegetables it just didn t work as well as my 9 99 serrated tv info knife i was disappointed,negative
this is wonderful the best laundry basket ever used,positive
they look nice but the towels do not absorb much water i am very disappointed i suspect i ll use them a few times then give them to goodwill,negative
i bought this for my 2 dogs it works great cleans up easily the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it s large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home it doesn t fit under my kitchen sink faucet i don t have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer \( wish i did \) \) otherwise it would be a snap to fill i have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs the container is really heavy once it s full my only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one \( 2 gallon or 1 gallon \) waterer it would be easier to handle i also bought the 5 gallon feeder i love it it holds a whole 5lb bag of food which is great so get the larger feeder the smaller waterer oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it,positive
best investment i have ever made in cookware heats evenly more thoroughly and burns less amazingly tough and the best part is i don t have to hunt for special plastic utensils to mix and stir this is sweet cookware and so dang easy to clean i love it,positive
i recieved this from my husband after he got it as a gift at a secret santa party it is a really beautiful set and all the candles and accents matched what was advertized i set it up in my office \( in a different pattern from what was shown \) and it really adds a nice touch especially with its blend of soothing smells my only complaint is that one of the glass stones was broken in half and the other half could not be found it probably slipped through the quality control department at the factory but it had plenty of others to compensate so it s not a big deal i highly recommend this product especially if you like to customize and design your centerpieces rather than have them pre assembled,positive
the bed warmer was described as dual controlled it comes with only one control the entire bed has to be at the same temperature the reason i wanted dual control was because my husband is always warm and i m almost always cold hence seperate controls were needed since we had the coldest winter in years i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described it does heat well though,negative
do not bother to buy this sewing machine case it is crappy don t be fooled by the universal phrase of this product i have a brother sewing machine so i bought this item when i got it i placed my sewing machine and i rattles around inside the case i don t see what is so universal about this there is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case it s terrible i d give no star but i don t have that choice on the selection i wanted to return it but it s not worth the shipping charge that will incure on my refund due to amazon s policies by then i would probably only get at most 12 00 back in refunds,negative
my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can t beat the quality,positive
i was glad to see the unit arrived without damage \( despite poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer \) the unit works great,positive
you would never know it was reconditioned it is probably even better than new plus being dishwasher friendly makes even easier to use,positive
these pans are great they are very sturdy and good quality don t buy anything else trust me,positive
first the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner that can be overlooked but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability i may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks no matter what setting i put it on horrible to say the least i sent it back and purchased a new one which i enjoy to this day,negative
this rice cooker has a non stick bowl which makes clean up a cinch the indicator light is red when cooking and green when warming it cooks the rice perfectly every time also this cooker is small and easy to store,positive
miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure but i want to recommend the seller witbecks wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually witbecks when dhl screwed up their delivery \( an immensely crappy organization but that s another story \) he stepped in and sent another unit without delay terrific guy terrific price terrific service,positive
not a good light the light is already fading and i don t use it very often very disappointed,negative
first off this is available at the ewins site for 30 should you decide to plunge the construction of the wooden parts is pretty nice better than what you d expect for 50 but that s about the only positive thing the hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you need so you re kind of sol when the crappy aluminum cams break i m sure they d send some more if i asked but for now my piece is hanging out half way assembled because i m scared of breaking any more of the hardware either way i think i m going to ditch the cam bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up the instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web if you ve never built flat pack furniture before you will not be able to figure it out even if you have you will put something together incorrectly and have to disassemble the piece,negative
if you want the retro look and a super toaster this is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great i ve had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering it s a big toaster shape is unusual \( taller in back than the front \) which gives it a little character excellent,positive
this mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot i would expect to pay much more for such a product the grind is even and consistent the appearance is sleek and modern yet classic i would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift,positive
i actually purchased this book light so that i can read while i wait for my child to sleep he likes me to be in the room this was perfect does not put out enough light to bother my son but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while i wait for him to fall asleep,positive
we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago it has held up so well that i just purchased ten more place settings \( the friday only sale \) to use for entertaining our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold \( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from \) the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions,positive
worst product ever don t know how it passed through initial testing when you turn the crank to dispense cereal it crushes it and sprays it all over the room awful just awful too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash waste of money and space and we tried dog food which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck really made me angry that i wasted the money false advertising,negative
i have been looking for a good cheese plane and this one isn t it it works fine for rubbery semi soft cheeses like swiss but not for harder cheese like cheddar which tend to crrumble before i can finish a slice the problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid it should be thin and flexible also don t let the name fool you this utensil is made in china a country which consumes very little cheese,negative
i just got this thing 2 hours ago in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working made it through about 8oz try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot nope number one this is nothing more than a typical small hand held grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing do not buy this the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing,negative
my son who lives in washington uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer we live in california but bought this fan to help vent our computer room which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled it works great we plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down,positive
my son is a star wars nut and just loves this blanket,positive
this is a great cookie sheet i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it s durable my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality i would highly recommend this pan especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only 30 a great deal,positive
i received this item in the description is stated is was 17 inches long when in reallity it was 22 unable to use still sitting in the box unused tried to contact the 800 given by the rep to return to date no luc,negative
if i could give half a star i would i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day i used it less than 3 times a week there are several drawbacks to this unit it draws alot of electricity to run it i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on water gurgles spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned the spout is also poorly designed the water doesn t come out in an even stream it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago it is everything this kettle isn t and so much more read the reviews on that one before you buy this one its a better choice all around save the shipping costs time headache just buy the braun first and pass this one up,negative
for the price these bath sheets are great very soft and plush exactly what i was expecting,positive
i bought this sauce pan last week the quality is very good the handle design is quite comfortable i tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan i found no hot spot it responded to the change in the heat setting is average it s kind of heavier than all clad ltd for the same size of pan i m not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet for the initial impression this calphalon one non stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as all clad ltd stainless steel mc2 look for the bargain it s worth the cost,positive
let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25 year old woman who isn t really big on doing chores i got a dyson for christmas and just tried out the dusting brush last week my immediate reaction was this is genius it is great for dusting computers televisions lampshades bookcases \( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices so normal dusting never seemed to help \) the tops of books cd organizers ceiling fan blades metal bedframes i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment and it works beautifully this attachment will not disappoint trust me it s already made my life so much easier and cleaner,positive
i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet so now you don t have filtered water my husband replaced washer and it still dripped if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined,negative
there isn t much to like about these sheets they wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired hanging threads are all over the place i would not recommend these sheets at all,negative

it is big and heavy but a real workhorse mixes things we would only do by hand before,positive
i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses my wife can even use it without burning stuff which she admits is a feat for her so she uses it several times a week too it holds heat well cleans up easy and the lip on the corner works great for draining only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove with gas you should be fine it hasn t seemed to effect the performance though and for the money it is quite perfect,positive
a few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall it works like new probably not a perfect vacuum but works well parts are available if you need them not a top of the line but neither is the price at 60 70 with free shipping,positive
i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser when it arrived the teapot was broken with a large section missing from the side i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price after receiving my second teapot it was cracked in the exact same spot i returned the product and complained with no response i was refunded the price for the teapot but i am out 10 in the cost of shipping it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot so i would try a different product,negative
purchased at petsmart seems to work well very quiet when operating properly took our cats a little over a week to get used to it the flow isn t very good when the setting is low we keep it at medium i clean it out about once a week cat hair from our medium haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well,positive
the price seemed great and i really liked the modern look when i took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked assembly was very easy it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes \( the most \) the design is really great it s very compact perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better great idea poorly executed would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product my main concern is that the construction seems like it wouldn t last too long i feel like i should attach sit carefully tag to it before anybody comes over,negative
i bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker i could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it rather than 2 however i used it exactly 5 days and then it died granted the econonical price was a factor when i purchased it but i really expected it to last more than 5 days unfortunately it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed so i was forced to throw it away lesson learned some things are just not a bargain,negative
the spice rack looks nice won t know the quality until i can use it and see how much weight it will take i had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet it is definitely a 2 person job and there was only me the self adhesive tabs didn t work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws very awkward to use the screws doesn t allow for any room especially the back screws i did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible i wouldn t have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet took much too much time to get it into place,negative
i have four 16 piece sets that i received for my wedding they are beautiful plates but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use like heating food up in the microwave going through the dishwasher or serving hot food within 3 months several plates cracked down the middle making them unusable a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added i did a search on www epinions com and found i wasn t the only person having these problems everyone is having these problems plus it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces you have to buy another set what a racket the clincher is that they are located in indonesia so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent i ve gotten nothing but the international run around,negative
this is a hollow ground blade \( not flat ground \) which does not cut straight the blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this get a knife with a flat ground blade not this one you can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade it is a cheaper way to make knives,negative
by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non stick pans it s already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches it also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface,positive
these are simply beautiful glasses they are every bit as elegant as reidel but cost much less the glass is thin the shape is elegant they hold up well in washing i recommend them,positive
i use this in my 29 gallon and the filter is excellent the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in it is also very quiet however when the power goes out and comes back on it won t begin working again you must add water to it to get it up and running this has been a problem when i ve gone on vacation and i ve come home to cloudy water the refills are also pretty expensive and can get a bit messy it s all worth it though it keeps my tank in nice condition,positive
completely satisfied it boils fast and looks great on the kitchen counter from england so used a lot for cups of tea have tried several makes but cant beat this for quality and price m william,positive
i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special,positive

i left my old pressure cooker \( a tefal made of steel \) in storage in another state and i was dying to have a new one i bought this because the price was great and the description seemed to make this set attractive and i m very glad i did both pots \( the large and the smaller \) fit the pressure lid so it s like having two pressure cookers instead of one one night i cooked lamb in the small pot and in 20 minutes i had a very nice and super tender meal and the next day i made beef broth with the large cooker so that i could freeze it and pull it out anytime i want it i m very satisfied with this product it looks great it s very efficient and it s very strong and durable the set also comes with a cooking book containing easy recipes of all kinds from main courses to desserts and even a table with cooking time for many items,positive
this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake the 5 quart was worth the money don t buy the 4 qt save the money and purchase the 5 you ll be glad that you did,positive
i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one,positive
i have a 3 1 2 year old boxer that barks cries whines and howls when i go to work all day i know i recorded it i went to petsmart and picked up this gadget brought it home and it the manual correct button she bolted she hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes it reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and i don t crate my dog when i m going to be away for more than 8 hours so if i m just running out for a few hours i stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if i m going to work i use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar my girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he s otherwise engaged but my dog hates it worth the price in my opinion best advice is to take it home and try it some dogs react to it others don t,positive
unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time with normal bread in before lowering the bread sticks almost 1 2 way out of the toaster making it very easy to remove hot toast to toast smaller items \( the plunger will go up even further to assist \) the slots are extra wide so although i have not used the sandwich cage accessory i can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage \( apparently a british idea and maybe something worth investigating \) i am doing normal toast on only setting 2 bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect \( bagel feature push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right \) the machine feels solid as if it will last a long time the cobalt blue color is more of a bluish purple in normal light but very attractive very happy with the machine \( the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping,positive

i own the graphite style of this set i was originally very happy with the purchase the set looked great didn t chip easily and was a great size after a year of use i ve come up with a list of problems the clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed the semi matte finish acquires a powdery almost bleached look to it after many washings \( says dishwasher safe guess that means the colors don t wash away immediately \) my biggest complaint we bought these because they were microwave safe i don t know what microwave safe means to most people but it means to me that i could put a plate bowl or cup in the microwave heat up the contents and then safely remove the object and use it in the case of the set i purchased it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode unfortunately in the case of the sango graphite set it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the \( plate bowl cup \) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the \( plate bowl cup \) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave they get very hot \( cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120f while cup surface is 170f \) i ve only broken 2 items from the set both times i dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned \( first time i thought it was a fluke second time i learned my lesson \) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave i emailed sango several times and received no response at all while i liked the set a lot initially i have been very disappointed over time with its quality i will never purchase another from sango again,negative

i bought this for my mother a year ago and i was recently looking for a vacuum myself so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing i asked her how she liked it she said she liked it and thought it worked well and loved how light it was \( she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis \) so needless to say i went out and purchased it trusting mother deartest s opinion i hate it i just moved out of my house and i had to clean \( vacuum \) every room in the house it took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy hoover vacuum to do the job one sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s just to pick up some damn crumbs also you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily after only vacuuming about half a room it will not suck up hair rather it gets tangled in the wheel and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never ever cleaned out hence making it harder and harder to pick things up \( not that it does to begin with \) it s loud time consuming and the biggest waste of money the only thing it has going for it is its weight which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway oh and i ve used this product once once one time of use pretty much was all it was worth if that i m taking it back and throwing it at them don t waste your money on this people,negative
i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still haven t received this i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now won t get it until june 30th costumer service is ridiculous i was told it would take 3 5 days that s why i ordered it don t get it if you need it within one yea,negative
this is a high quality pan with a nice heavy weight to it not at all flimsy i wanted to get one like my mom s and this turned out to be less expensive but a much better quality and heavier weight i bought 2 of these along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon s 4 for 3 promotion and it only came to about 30 that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality i would absolutely recommend these,positive
saw these canisters and fell in love with them couldn t wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn t fit properly another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off i was disppointed in the quality i wouldn t buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive,negative
i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles but mostly they ignored it when i got the battery and the bird started moving my two older cats weren t impressed but my youngest \( about 1 1 2 years \) went crazy it s pretty funny watching her with the toy she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird it s also entertaining when she s finished playing she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly which means she is hit in the backside by the bird naturally this starts the fight with the bird all over again i m pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well but even if it s just the kitten it s worth the money,positive
this is the most loathesome appliance i have ever owned i hate everything about it some genius put the power cord at the bottom of the unit so you have to hold the cord up all the time to keep from backing over it this may not be such a problem if the stupid self propelled function weren t constantly trying to shoot backward meaning i need both hands just to push the unit forward it s like i m dancing with my vacuum and we re fighting for the lead ridiculous i have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house and i wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster oh it also came with a free little red dd sweeper the handle of which broke the first time i tried to use it i don t know if dd came under new management or what but i will never buy one of their products again,negative
great coffee and a convenient size but the carafes keep breaking on me i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke i ordered a replacement and was extra careful when handling it \( especially when washing it \) i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke these things just seem to spontaneously combust the carafes are 12 a piece so it s not worth replacing again argh,negative
this unit is smaller than i was expecting it is 11 tall and 5 5 in diameter i have it in our small bathroom at the moment because it was too small to affect the humidity level in the 120 square foot room i had originally put it in \( i have a hygrometer in the room to measure its humidity and this unit did not affect the humidity level in 24 hours \) i doubt it is adequate for our tiny bathroom it seems like it might be adequate for a not too humid closet it says it removes 16oz a day at 86 degrees fahrenheit but whose house it 86 degrees in our humid bathroom it sucks up a mere third of an inch a day i guess it performs better in a warmer space,negative
these treats have been great for our large breed older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips they re also one of the few glucosamine treats that don t make him sick,positive
i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i didn t hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore,negative
i just received this set yesterday and haven t had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet \( i ll try to remember to update this review once i do \) but there were a few initial impressions i thought merited a review on their own the cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package instead the kit contained a small fold out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook \( i doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook or even that it sways many would be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit but its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase and is something you should know before you buy \) that having been said the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good i have no doubt whatsoever that they ll be wonderful functional additions to my kitchen the hard anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability i m impressed and i ll be back to say more once i actually use them to make pizzas,positive
the stool is excellent quality looks good and works well the surprise is the weight very heavy,positive
i bought this coffee maker because of its compact size but returned it a week later i found it very difficult to avoid spillage when pouring the water into the coffee maker and the coffee into a cup the problem was worse if making more than 4 cups another problem was the taste of the coffee i like my coffee full of flavor i have been using drip coffee makers for several years and think i know how to get the coffee just right but every carafe of coffee from this tasted weak and much too hot almost scalding,negative

we are using 2 love seat throws for an old l shaped sectional sofa it really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color the material quality is great for the price the only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping say about once a day the throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in built mechanisms to hold in place \( e g a velcro system straps etc \) so you have to put the throw over the sofa again neatly if you don t mind arranging the throw about once a day this will be a very inexpensive and great looking cover for your sofa,positive
this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image it broke the second week i had it spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor it s pure crap stay away,negative
it s weird the handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome emeril logo then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it s shape easily you d hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle but not here it s not a bad whisk for the price but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars buy something else,negative
i was going to buy the lello 45900 ariete espresso cappuccino maker because the price was so good but i waited over three months because it was not in stock so i looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price but after using it it s more than twice the machine i think on the amazon description it says the pump is a 16 bar pump but after checking reviews on different web sites i think amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites it says the a pump to be 17 5 bar pump that s even better and the other thing that i like was the fact that it had a cd that was not said on the description either i never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful shows and explains the basics from making espresso two frothing the milk cleaning tips and more very helpful so i made myself my first shot of espresso it was great nice little cream on top it just looked beautiful i didn t think it would work to good because i bought some pods and i wasn t sure how it would work works great taste great and easy to clean second day i made myself a latte again excellent third day i got adventurous i made myself my first cappuccino and again great put starbucks to shame the espresso i was using was the illy sucro espresso pods 906 naturally the espresso you use is actually more important than the machine i guess this one taste great about different type of syrups caramel vanilla hazelnuts irish cream the syrups brand was davinci so yes i am very satisfied with this machine and i guess i got lucky because this one was out of stock for a long time,positive
just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place paid 6 50 for item and 6 34 for shipping and was very displeased upset with quality of the item i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft,negative
we use this to serve ice water at meals it is so beautiful it holds a full 2 qts not much else to say about it it is a water pitcher after all it is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table we have two one for each end of the table,positive

i bought this unit a few years back worthless at best i wish someone even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units i called their customer service who said good luck as their best solution the problem is aluminum cools off too fast it will not retain heat i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake do they make them anymore ebay help,negative
my mother had a set of franciscan apple dinnerware as i was growing up though i never thought too much about what i was eating off of at the time later as a wife and mother myself i was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen we had just moved to appleton wi \( 16 years ago \) so i decided to use an apple theme w o even connecting the idea with my mom s dishes i was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the franciscan dishes over the years i ve collected innumerable apple items but my goal is to have a set of franciscan apple dishes of my own they do chip but they last forever and retain their color beautifully,positive
i bought these sheets 6 8 months back i have been using these sheets regularly even after many wash i don t see the sign of lint coming out this seems to be one of my great value for money very soft and cozy excellent for winter even after many wash there are no sign of lints excellent for the price,positive
not much to be said about this product just watch for a low price and then stock up,positive
it was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though i always kept it charged since this is the type of product you might take camping i don t recommend it because it s not reliable i used it once or sometimes twice a day no more so i really think it should have lasted longer,negative
i just tried this out for the first time and i was impressed it baked evenly and nicely best of all the cake came right out i simply sprayed it lightly with non stick spray and baked due the flexibility of this product you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability i will be buying more from this line,positive
i bought this blender based on the reviews here as well as its great looking design when i got the blender only one of those factors came through first thing i noticed both blender jars leaked badly after reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible the leak was slightly reduced the metal jar still poured out liquids from the base second thing i noticed this blender cannot make a good smoothie even after a couple minutes of blending there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades \( regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie \) for a blender of any price the delonghi does a poor job making smoothies for a blender that costs what the delonghi does this performance is totally unjustifiable but hey it does look really good,negative
my 82 year old aunt can now open a wine bottle because the vacu vin requires minimal physical strength the only i have found that is so easy to use except for bench models,positive
it is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels \) what you probably don t see on the picture well it stands on plastic so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding has really easy refill no mess no fuss and you can always see when you need to buy pepper i don t think there is better pepper grinder out there others i saw are certainly better looking artsy whatever but this one is the most useful,positive
when i ordered this product it had a 4 star average rating how that happened is beyond me were a zero star rating available this product wouldn t even deserve the string of uncolored stars i purchased it thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic freebie grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago after many refills that all plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the gears the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper so i order this one it s attractive low mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out and guess what i m still using the plastic worn out grinder this miu grinder was a total waste of money and i just can t bear to listen to it squeal when i attempt to use it its adjustement is loose enough that s not the problem what good s a lifetime warranty against wearing out if i m not going to use the grinder at all now i m stuck with it unless i want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order so basically i may could get a few bucks back which is probably what i ll do because this grinder isn t worth 2 cents i wouldn t even give the thing away maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person i ll certainly not purchase another one online if you like the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard buy this grinder buy a second one for your salt while you re at it you ll love em \( update 1 month later i tried to give this thing a chance and the god awful squealing is becoming less consistent which might be even worse as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high pitched jag every so often it s gotten quite worse however with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn from fine grind to quarter corn sized pieces in a few turns not recommended at all i might try switching it over to salt maybe it can handle that better,negative
i bought these because i was sick of creating foil shields on the pies i bake i love that these slip perfectly on and off however i ve found that since they re made of metal or aluminum they actually conduct heat and cause the crust of the pie to darken faster than the center which is exactly what i didn t want it to do that said i have to admit that while the edges of my pies look darker than the rest it hasn t come out burnt as it would if i were to bake the pie without any sort of shield i m planning on buying another brand s something made from silicone instead,negative
i bought this power mop for my daughter for christmas and it broke the first time she used it,negative

i purchased this toy for a friend s dog a while back the dog loved it he played with it non stop \( quack quack \) when he finally destroyed it though we were shocked inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag my friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items we did complain to the manufacturer who said they d look into it but i would still be wary of this toy i think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it s toys but doesn t rip them to shreds there is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe,negative
my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends his bedroom was decorated with thomas but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for 3 99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block out light because i opened package the other set i send back to amazon i do not recommend this product and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block out light,negative
the coat rack works wonderful for us we hang our robes \( tend to be thick and heavy \) before going into the hot tub it was very easy to assemble lightweight yet it holds the robesas one expects a coat rack to do i don t understand the reviews that indicated difficulty assembling or trouble with its stability none of that is the case for us,positive
it is thicker than other bed pads but not as thick as i expected quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on easy to put on the bed,positive

cuts like a samurai blade quality and doesn t need to steel as frequent as the henckels wusthof knives it has excellent weight for a medium sized hand however the handles get quite slippery when wet so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety also if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel don t because this global blade is much harder than the henckels wusthof blades a qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must or if you really like the steel design get the global steel which can cost quite a bit overall this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed just like a samurai would do to get use to his sword,positive
i received this popper as a gift and while it looks nice it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn nothing worked if i had the receipt it would already have been returned since i don t it is going in the garbage also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine stay away from this machine,negative

i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer,negative
this wok is heavy and unbalanced it can tip while on the element the long handle is thick and uncomfortable and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task the flat bottom isn t wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir frying if i wanted to saut i d have gotten a saut pan the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere you need lots of counter space as well this wok just isn t large enough for stir frying for more than two people,negative
i m a betta hobbist and i know about all the misconceptions that betta can live in just about anything and it is bogus this aquarium is way too small betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1 2x weekly atleast this is probably 1 2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills this also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just isn t good you can also buy large critter carriers \( 2 3 gallons \) for the same price or less it wouldn t be great but it d be a heck of a lot better,negative
the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove,negative
i recieved this rack for christmas and i love it it looks great and my 4 year old daughter likes to use it too the only thing i don t like is that it only holds 50 dvds and 2 racks look nice but any more than that is gonna look dumb i also like that the drawers pull out and sit on top for easy viewing,positive
the pan arrived on time and undamaged in the factory box the nonstick surface is slicker than the hardened titanium one used on scanpan and cleans easily the rotating vent on the glass lid is a nice feature my wife was skeptical at first but i ve caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently in fact it s become their favorite pan unlike a pure teflon finish this pan will brown the food nicely as far as durability goes well it s too early to tell but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product i like it,positive

i ve seen this particular clock at other web sites i decided to buy it from target com because the price was good and there is free shipping when i received the clock in only 3 days i was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed it arrived in perfect condition i inserted an aa battery only to wonder whether i had gotten a dud it didn t make any perceptible tick soon it was clear that the clock was working well and i hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and i love it i highly recommend this very quiet well made clock,positive
i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker but when it arrived it was just like brand new including all original packing perfect i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately but again it was quite strong in this regard and froze the mixtures perfectly admittedly doesn t make a huge amount but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it and it s way quieter than the old fashioned freezers also it was half the price of a new one buy it,positive
i did not buy the whole set my review is for an 8 fry pan it was one of those try it deals i do not like the grooves in the pan because after for instance frying an egg the grooves retain food and if you don t use a brush to scrub the grooves you ll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves i can t imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware yikes,negative
we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out when i saw the refurbished for 20 00 i thought it was a great deal it would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn t leak it didn t come with seals or with the water purifier i tried everything including new seals \( that i bought separately \) eventually we just went out and purchased a new one because we still like the model,negative
alas this had no discernable effect on my cats however the product arrived in good time and in good shape,negative
my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it,negative
this canister vac might be ok for very light duty but don t expect it to handle any real housecleaning the filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot if i had it to do over again i would not purchase this vac i would save up and buy a better canister vacuum,negative
this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole soup tureen handles are sturdy but short so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder but easy to grip with bare hands because of this feature you may decide to use this as a serving dish only good for a large group rather than due to large capacity we are a family of 2 so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox,positive
i bought this board along with another brand this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink it also warped within one month of my purchasing it the wood has also splintered not my idea of a good cutting board i would not recommend it to my friends nor would i purchase it as a gift,negative
this whisk is very nice and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand one thing i hadn t foreseen however is actually pretty obvious the silicone doesn t slide very well along most surfaces so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction it is exactly as advertised though and i am very happy to have it,positive
many of you reading these reviews may be wondering how this compares to similar items made of cast iron i can tell you that while it obviously isn t cast iron and for that reason alone many will say it is inferior it is still an excellent griddle the bottom is very heavy and it conducts heat well it fits perfectly over 2 burners on one side of my gas stove i ve cooked several sandwiches at once on it as well as pancakes and some eggs and the heat seems to distribute very evenly i was very impressed with this aspect of the griddle as cast iron is known for its even heating and i was wondering how an aluminum griddle would hold up it definitely does a fine job the bonus of course is the nonstick surface and it s a good one not some chintzy teflon coating good quality construction the handles are solid and it doesn t feel cheap at all when you hold it take care of this griddle \( make sure it doesn t get scratched \) and it will take care of you,positive
i feel rich sleeping in these sheets they are quite wrinkley but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i m sure money well spent,positive

absolutely fab shiny bright stainless steel matches frieling french press and any other stainless tableware countertop items perfectly just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so of course the sugar bowl holds plenty note you ll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go around at a table seating 4 6 coffee lovers overall these are just very sturdy solid clean up beautifully and very easily and by the way the sugar spoon included with the lid covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar and sets inside the little notched area of the lower bowl so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered on at the same time a really simple yet european engineered well thought out design quality i fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me down although it s a l o o o ng time until i ll be distributing my assets make sure to buy the matching frieling french press it s just incredible also heirloom quality give yourself the gift of european quality coffeeware it s one of life s simple yet indispensible indulgences ps the frieling french coffee press w this matching sugar creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too,positive
not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful they also bake the most perfect pies i have ever put together the crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky i use martha s pate brisee recipe but with these pans it is foolproof i have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches wonderful,positive
i haven t used this for herbs but i have used it for onions and garlic and like the other reviewers found it very handy for quick and tear free mincing it s a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect i love that it s only 3 small parts \( 4 if you count the rubber blade \) that all fit easily into the dishwasher \( top rack \),positive
i bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great that is until it started leaking about 4 months after i bought it giving the benefit of the doubt and thinking the leak was a qa issue rather than a design issue i managed to exchange it for the exact same model well it s been 4 months since i got the new one and this morning what did i notice yup a leak the tank was full yesterday and this morning it s 2 3 s full with a pool of water on the table that holds it luckily no damage was done to the floor either time i understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time well then it s just a cruddy product stay away from this aquarium,negative

we just purchased ours this past week and we love it we ve had glass coffee makers before and we used to waste so much coffee because it sat on the burner and burnt now we throw away nothing sometimes we wake up the next morning and there is still a half a pot left a good 1 minute zap in the microwave and it tastes just as good as it did when it was first brewed this is our second thermal coffee maker and we have found that unless you remove the coffee filter holder after each use and rinse it it will leak all over coffee grounds get stuck in the little holes where the coffee comes out and into the thermal pot also to stop the leak problem be careful when putting in coffee grounds make sure none get past it im a little surprised at the negatives reviews on this product its an in expensive coffee maker and it does the job very well the over flowing of coffee and the leakage problem is due to improper housekeeping we havent had any problems with this,positive
if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment this isn t for you the radio is hard to use since it doesn t have any indication of what frequency you are on and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static the pedometer function is marginal at best but its what you would expect for 15,negative
this griddle performed very poorly and i will not be keeping it it cooked very unevenly \( the left side of a 4 inch pancake was almost burned while the right side was practically raw \) and the pancakes stuck even though it is supposed to be preseasoned \( it s cast iron \) and i heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil it also did not sit securely on my gas stove due to the grill ridges on the other side it rocks back and forth slightly even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass because i use my griddle almost every weekend i am considering the broil king ultra large electric giddle which got cook s illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests,negative
this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes i ve owned larger crockpots for a couple decades \( currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family size meals \) but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space aren t at all useful for heating or re heating small quantities this little crockpot however is perfect for heating or re heating 2 4 servings of soup or stew i originally bought it however because it is absolutely perfect for making hot cereal on cold mornings especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop such as steel cut oatmeal \( try the nutty goodness of traditional steel cut oatmeal once \( also available here at amazon \) you re unlikely ever to return to instant or quick cook oatmeal again \) there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you from mid october to late march virtually every night i prepare my entire family s hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave other uses we ve discovered it s perfect for making serving hot mulled cider keeping hot dips gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet as a substitute fondue pot for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient \( how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup \) for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker especially if used in conjunction with rival s inexpensive sp100 pdq smart part module \( also sold on amazon as of the date of this review \) which provides the same timed cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival s larger more expensive crockpots the energy used is minimal too only 80 watts the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher as does the lid for very convenient clean up,positive
it s a wonderful cutting board \( also available at the store \) i m a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something i ve found very useful any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic this one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks the 9 99 price tag isn t bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well that and it just looks great in the kitchen i use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and wouldn t go without them don t listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a 14 x 17 solid granite cutting board for ten bucks not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives fyi to the moron amp quot protect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight tough polyethylene cutting boards amp quot yah nothing at all dimwit,positive

the unit features automatic shut off when water is low by using a proximity switch via a float with a magnet in it it has a shut off by setting humidity level and a shut off by count down timer after a few weeks of use the unit started leaking and you can t even tell where the leak is coming from the pads do not prevent mineral build up on the hot plate i am getting brownish deposits which i believe to be rust the only way to remove it is with white vinegar and old toothbrush which i had to bend into an l shape in order to get at and clean the stainless steel hotplate which boils the water i was happy with the unit and preferred it over an ultrasonic unit i had until it start leaking,negative
the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisserie the grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals,positive

i bought this product on my mom s suggestion because she was impressed with the suction power not only did the suction power fade over the first few months of ownership but within 6 months the vacuum was completely broken i called in to customer service because it was still under warranty and they were anything but helpful they sent me to a small shop 45 minutes away to have it fixed which took over a month they even lost my paperwork one month later it broke again and customer service suggested i take it out in my backyard take the vacuum apart and blow the small holes with an air compressor to clean it out for 400 this is ridiculous i want my 100 vacuum back,negative
wow what a fine example of terrible engineering the only control is a knob that ranges from off to super to set the thermostat you turn the knob to the super setting when the room reaches a comfortable level you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off this is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp at this setting the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp this design sets the stage for a frustrating user experience by design you must turn the thermostat to the highest setting then wait for the room to heat up before fiddling with the knob until the unit clicks off at which point you end up turning it up a bit until it clicks on \( if it does \) its like trying to adjust your home s thermostat in the dark just show me where to set the dial for 68 degrees and let me get on with my day when the heater is working as designed it turns on for 30 60 seconds turns off for 10 90 seconds then repeats the cycle relentlessly and unpredictably until you unplug it let it cool box it back up and send it back i want a refund reimbursement for lost productivity and an ice cream sandwich,negative

having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan as the tittle says pay the 3 4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead i m using the preseasoned more because it is just ready keep in mind its large and heavy careful in your sink coming from stainless steel and converted over to calphalon \( mostly bought all pieces from amazon com \) if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me heat kills everything if you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water salt scrubbing and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with but we all pay for convience and these pans i use mostly to sear meat with a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives get the preseasoned,positive
i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well can t win them all,negative

i really loved the look of the lamp and it went perfectly in my living room for a reading light next to my favorite chair two days after i bought it it broke at the place where it screws together on the pole i returned it and actually considered getting another one just because i liked the looks of it so well but ended up just getting a refund i was pretty disappointed and am still looking for a lamp to replace it,negative

we love these glasses we have had the reidel glasses like these many times they break so easily and can t go in the dishwasher these glasses are so much more utilitarian we use them as our everyday glasses not just for wine they look great feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher and cost so much less we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions they are more refined but i got so tired of that ultra thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass i strongly recommend the libbey glasses you will like it like like it on your table table table,positive
my friend was ecstatic when she opened up this present from me at the holidays she claims it s the best spice rack very durable stylish and doesn t take up too much space on the kitchen counter to prove her point she went and bought fresh spices and made her own personalized spice rack definitely was a hit,negative
this is a massive skillet be warned it s heavy but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan it s preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great i would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down,positive

after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one it has been great and i couldn t ask for anything better or more easy to use i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross odors or tastes my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated cleanup is easy also after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be i would recommend this with no caveats,positive

i purchased this fry pan in june of this year and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all clad but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer and a small fraction of the cost after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food ick i love the uncoated all clad but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future,negative

i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more francis francis being my first this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as espresso machines but marginally if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important focusing on the machine for a moment you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed,negative
i have two cats both less than 5 months old i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that s way over priced my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic save your money and use it on something more useful,negative

i found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate it s a soft light \( almost seems like a natural spectrum \) and is very directed at the page the clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover and the neck is flexible as needed so functionally it gets a solid a but i wasn t happy that it takes nonstandard batteries \( two of those round watch calculator batteries \) replacing them is a hassle \( though inexpensive \) because i have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before i leave and i have to find them in a store with an electronic department i wish this light took aaa or something the light does include batteries so you won t need to worry until you run out for me that was probably around 20 hours or so,positive
i received this as a christmas gift i ve used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you re flying it s the best way i ve ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere,positive
i ve lusted after a super auto for years when i finally decided to get one i did a fare amount of investigating the gaggia titanium had the best spec s for the price and good reviews i decided to spend the extra money for the stainless unit i haven t seen the painted plastic model so i can t comment on the appearance i do think the stainless looks great you can find reviews of the non stainless here on amazon and other than the outside appearance the device is the same i ve only had the unit for a few days but so far i m very happy to the negatives first the manual is awful it s not just the italian to english translation the text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great i spent a fair amount of time making sure i understood how to setup and use the unit i m pretty technically savvy and in the end i figured it all out but don t rush into using this product until you ve figured out how to set it up clean it and adjust all the settings \( there are many \) the only issue i ve had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it s empty when it s not open the lid \( which could be a bit better designed \) and stir and it works could be the beans i m using not sure it s an intermittent issue the good stuff once you figure out the coffee strength and grind the gaggia makes a delicious cup i wish the brew were a tad hotter \( i have it set to max \) but using the cup warmer helps no issues making froth with the wand much better than the older manual machine i had you can t put a huge mug under the unit \( the max size is 4 5 inches \) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed you can set the unit for the amount of brew however i found that clicking the large coffee button twice the unit thinks it s making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug it s much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size you get a nice foam on top and as i said the coffee is outstanding i love the clean up \( or lack of \) compared to the drip maker i had \( a bodum vacuum unit \) i still have that unit should i need to make a lot of coffee for company but for the two mugs i drink in the morning the gaggia easily replaces this unit and there s far less cleanup the grinds sit in a canister and after a few days you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse so you can use this gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you re making a cup or two what i love is just pressing a button twice \( for two large coffees \) and walking away from the unit a minute later a great cup of joe it truly is super automatic i have the unit set for energy savor whereby it s in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after i use it i only drink in the morning however if you decide to wake it up it heats up in about 2 minutes it also does a rinse cycle so i keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water there is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days there s also a full rinse cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir it s a menu item so don t select it unless you really want to do this \( takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire \) yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks i m very happy update the issue with the grinder was the beans \( too oily \) i called the ny office and got someone in tech support in minutes she knew her product sure enough the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area,positive
the only european characteristic of this cup is it s price the picture is deceiving this thing is tiny i could only put three of my fingers through it s ear i am definitely returning it to amazon in my mind it s worth 5 bucks and is more of a for a kid than an adult,negative

i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon it s a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i didn t quite understand at the time i bought it was that it s also just one big piece of fabric no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place kind of disappointing but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila a great looking couch appeared so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money,positive
i was looking for a timer that had a loud ringer i could hear from another room while cleaning so i could check on what i m cooking this one just didn t do that for me i notice the sound it sends out is not always the same sometimes it is a bit louder then other times to me that does not do me much good i cannot depent on it all the time so now i just use it to keep near me when i m at the computer but i do notice more of the sound comes out of the back but then you can t see how much time you have left if you turn it backwards the ringer goes for 1 min this does not count backward the numbers and buttons are large which is probably the reason i bought this timer the two magnets are not very big and does not stay on my frig very good when its on my frig and i start to press the buttons it starts moving all over price wise this is probably a good buy depending on what you want to use it for i bought another timer that the ringer is louder but the buttons and are very small guess you cannot have it all no matter at what the price is,negative
works good except for with the cappicuion pods they dont brew throughly but makes great coffee,negative

unless you re planning on washing dinner plates only this dish rack is not for you smaller plates \( or bowls for that matter \) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips \( about 1 8 inch \) so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open \( 3 1 4 inches \) anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor the utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom i bought this thinking that since polder has a good name it would be a good product i was wrong and polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design,negative
very well made a quality item works just as described in booklet,positive
we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model,negative

this waterer is a great concept but does have some drawbacks for starters one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it the other dog is just fine with it but then again he s deaf so the gurgle doesn t bother him lol the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls it gets dirty so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl but it s a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off clean the bowl and but the jug back on so if your dog isn t afraid of the noise it makes and you don t mind the extra hassle cleaning it it s great otherwise just get a large bowl that s what i ended up having to do,negative
ice bucket is smaller than i expected otherwise a very good product,positive
i bought this for my mother in law at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee,negative

we have owned other hoover steam cleaners they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet we bought the hoover f5914 900 based on the reviews i was confident that it wouldn t leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack i couldn t keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job ok our hoover came my husband put it together and it leaked all over i then re read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them by then we had already taken it to the repair center after a week they had not touched it my husband picked the machine up and brought it home we decided to start from square one and put it together again he did following the directions to the letter lo and behold no leaks yeah my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman so the moral to this story is always read the directions first,positive

i bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box first the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back there was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance finally it is just not good looking at all extremely cheap in appearance it did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to amazon i went with the bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers evidently another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances do not buy this item get the braun kf550 bk aromadeluxe instead,negative
the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top i was sent new doors but they didn t fit frustrated i accepted the promised 175 00 off to keep the doors knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later i have yet to receive this refund the delivery was also a major problem there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone so i tipped him to bring it in for me i will never buy anything from this company again,negative
okay i bought for the price and it is effective enough but it is very clumsy and unergonomic so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer the main problems are balance of weight and the switch first the switch because it is a cheap push in button which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on you lose optimum control quickly the handle is badly placed for this as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it but you can t hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting in addition keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife but because the button sinks deep into the handle so your thumb is inside the handle as you re trying to hold and control the knife quick cramp moreover as you re pushing it in if the food you re cutting is moist \( like a turkey \) juices may run onto the handle your thumb and into the hole into which you re pressing the button not safe a couple times i ve wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock either way it wasn t good then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good look at the huge bulk of the motor and then look at where the handle is located and how it is designed there s no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is add in the need to be depressing the power button as you re holding it awkwardly and 2 stars for effectiveness minus 3 for bad functional design,negative

when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b c the materials are light weight but i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic it was just so easy and looked so good i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer unlike other reviewers i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts,positive
product was fine except that it isn t microwaveable at the time of purchase it claimed to be microwaveable the handle has a screw in it i purchased it specifically for use in a microwave,negative
i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel let s be realistic these knives are cheap they re thin and they re not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that s what you re getting i hand washed these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and didn t hear back i finally got their address \( from the post office \) and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them \( with 15 minute wait times for each call \) to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i m going to finish my sentence so their rep would stop talking they won t refund my money in fact they won t refund anyone s money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they ll send me another set of soon to be rusty knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can,negative

i m terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute doesn t hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself,negative
i was impressed with all the pieces liked the pots with short handles but when washing the lids the handles on top get full of water and have to be sat up for water to drain out s l o w l e y before putting them away also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you re cooking but what do you want for 30 bucks,negative

unlike many people it seems i ve never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker it s still sturdy for me after about 8 uses however the fact that i ve owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself this waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles i ve never been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles i ve had in restaurants after trying over half a dozen different recipes i realized that it wasn t my ingredients it was the waffle maker this waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be crispy on the outside chewy and moist on the outside instead no matter what recipe i used or how long i cooked the waffles for i would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness \( if they had any to begin with \) within moments of leaving the waffle maker the model doesn t burn the waffles the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking and overall the waffle maker is nice looking but that s all it has going for it i ve learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances you get what you pay for,negative

i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation motor power and style i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet,negative
after about 10 days from date of purchase only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle i would have to push the on button get another 2 cups after 5 or 6 tries i would finally get all 8 cups through the design is bad for left handed people it s very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate the lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and i would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid overall not a good design i got my money back and am bought a hamilton beach brewstation which i think is a great coffemaker,negative
i ve changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years i cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself that said i still have reasonable water pressure and here s the amazing thing my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it who knew that for all my life it was the water not my hair my skin is not as dried out if i could work out the little glitches it would be perfect i own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it s fab for the price,positive

my girlfriend and i recently bought two ultrasonic humidfiers this machine and an air o swiss 7135 the venta worked well when it worked however it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason you could jiggle the thing and it would go on and off we finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base the water wasn t flowing properly and the machine stopped \( as it should \) because there was no water took it back to the hardware store where we bought it and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem it may be number 1 in germany but it gets only 1 star here,negative

cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you ll have bases covered,positive

i was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for xmas however if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs i won t be using it often the literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre seasoned and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat on the first try i had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots though i was able to get it to release with a pancake turner the scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off even with soaking for awhile on the second try i oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread so as to not have any bare spots i still had sticking ditto for clean up this thing weighs a ton too it is awkward to transfer off the burner the instructions warn lift do not slide on a glass top stove i think i ll continue to use my non stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press that always works great,negative
the price was excellent ordering was quick and easy delivery was prompt the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle,positive

moved into a new home wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets decided to try a bagless model this thing is a total waste of money it has barely any suction whatsoever especially when trying to use the hose so for now after running this thing i have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just couldn t suck up it s ridiculous it s a brand new vacuum i have never had to do this with any other vacuum i had my husband make sure it was working right and it is it just has a very weak suction this thing is going back to the store and i am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum don t waste your money also i have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors \( well they all pretty much do that job but for some reason this has a bare floor setting whoop de do \) it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor nor can it suck up a cobweb don t buy,negative

i bought this toaster after reading several reviews finding a reasonable price and liking the look of it i was looking to upgrade since my old toaster \( a toastmaster \) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown i am seriously disappointed with this toaster i put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts and that half usually ends up burnt the slots are slanted forward and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster it is the upper portion that over toasts and the lower portion comes out essentially raw though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so and had to go through two cycles it still toasted better then this t fal i bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times i am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand hope this helps,negative
i must admit i m really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is it s still too early as i ve only had it for a month or so and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it s been given we have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with and so far there has been no problem i highly recommend this little guy and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place one suggestion though wonder how long it ll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model that way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode,positive

the kitchen odors were getting very bad we realized that the filter had never been changed it is an old recirculating system over the stove finding filters is for the birds filters are all listed by a serial or code number i think the psychology is that you use only the filter from the original manufacturer after looking at many different types of filters these seemed to be cutable is that a word we did not need to cut they fit into the nutone range hood perfectly our nutone hood is so old that we could not find anything listed on the nutone site so these fit the house odor while cooking is diminished what is not clear is how often they should be replaced obviously when the smell gets worse but i have no idea if 6 months or 6 years will buy more cheaper than a new hood,positive
the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier it works really well,positive
this shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble this hold alot of shoes and spins really nice i have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11 s fit just fine this shoe rack is perfect i highly reccomend it,positive
this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before it also heats very evenly the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem,positive
the best buy i have ever found on 1000 count sheets they are excellent quality,positive
i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it s also compact i gained a little more counter space,positive
this product is perfect for keeping pots and pans from scratching our new stainless steel sink rubber feet are great for protecting the sink as well,positive
i ll admit i had to learn how to use this turner because of its shape but now i realize that it s far better than any spatula i ve ever had i can actually flip a burger now \( something i could never do before \) i ve got to check out more emerilware you will not be disappointed this spatula is definitely worth it,positive
first one that i have purchased and it is extremely wonderful in the weight content as well as keeping us warm without feeling smothere,positive
i think i m a little crazy for buying this i just had to find out if the copper core was really better than an aluminum one it is but not by that much you can buy a pan from cuisinart s multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price that being said this thing is very well designed the rolled lip is useful for pouring the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there \( a problem with most pans \) the handle stays cool and is well designed overall this is the best 2 quart saute pan money can buy is it worth it that s up to you,positive
functionally this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner it is not attractive to look at however my walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish the varnish is very high gloss and the knobs are low grade mismatched junk i believe the build is solid but only time will tell final word pay the extra money for a hand crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally this just isn t worth 300,negative
i took a chance on ordering these and i m glad i did they are heavy duty i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it s nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware i ve also used these in a convection oven and them seem to work really great i picked the sapphire color and they are very attractive on the table as well,positive
i can t believe i spent good money on this vacuum i ve had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems why it won t vacuum without pushing it with all my might why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children why the filter won t stay in place and why it smells like burned rubber every time am forced to use it i have replaced every filter and belt now i am going to throw it away i d gladly give it to charity but i can t in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim,negative

i am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs amazon s listing says this innotek trainer comes with a lifetime warranty i ve read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars so i decided to review the owner s manual to learn more about the warranty the last page has a section entitled lifetime limited warranty which states innotek brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase the lifetime warranty apparently expires after one year further on it says the company offers several product exchange options during the warranty period costs are dependent on the processing time this suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year lifetime warranty the next paragraph says after one year from date of original retail purchase we will repair replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate based on the component what will these repairs cost this leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from innotek what if anything is warranted for a lifetime if the lifetime warranty is really only for one year why call it lifetime and finally what will repairs cost both during warranty under their product exchange options and afterwards under their component based fixed rate my specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery the manual does not indicate that this battery is user replaceable does this mean the user will have to send the collar to innotek to replace the battery and if so what will it cost i have contacted innotek through their website and will report back if i get a response until i do i ve got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty can anyone comment on warranty claims to innotek,negative

i ve used this for indian food and it worked really well you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala btw i own other anolon advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup re the squishy handle if you have gripping problems as many middle age to older cooks do this helps you don t listen to the young self involved and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature,positive
i like the idea of this bundt pan i made 3 batches of chocolate truffles on it the recipe that comes with the pan is awesome however i have yet to figure out how to get the chocolates out easily the first time i used a non stick spray \( not vegetable oil \) i thought that might be my problem because the company recommends vegetable oil on the next two batches i poured vegetable oil in the little holes and spread it around using a pastry brush again i had to fight to get the chocolates out i kid you not my husband pounded on the pan with a big rubber mallet to get the chocolates to come out i must be doing something wrong i will call customer service tomorrow but if there is a trick to this they should have told you on the instructions on how to make the truffles other than that the chocolates turned out beautifully and i will use this pan again even if i have to call my husband to help me out with his rubber mallet,positive
this knife is great for hard cheeses i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily but if you only use it for cheese it should stay sharp for a long time this is another beautiful global knife,positive

i purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep i have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans my son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus saying he hasn t slept this good in a long time the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and i too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom very sturdy steel construction easy assembly of the legs 3 speeds top speed is out of this world almost like a wind storm me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house what a riot i highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation sleep aid and some silly fun,positive
i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo they appeared to be very sharp however i did not like these knives for the following reasons 1 \) i dont care much for the cheap plastic like orange handles 2 \) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap furi implies that these knives are made in germany however they are cheaply made in china now generally i dont care that much everything is now made in china anyways but when i am paying so much money for a product i was hoping it was made in germany or usa 3 \) the case is even more cheaply made personally i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives,negative
i was very hesitant to spend close to 160 on a single fry pan but i had heard so many good things about all clad and thought it would be a wise investment for the first 6 months the pan was great i loved the large size and used it often i was just about ready to invest in an entire set of all clad cookware when my pan warped i was using it on an electric stove as usual and the pan just simply warped i was thoroughly disappointed that a 160 pan would warp during normal use i won t be spending this kind of money again follow up i contacted all clad regarding the warped pan they had me send it in for evaluation and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door i m impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product,negative

the concept here is good no tools needed to install the product itself is well made but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down,negative
unfortunately there is no option for 0 star i had the same problem as lana from nc i ordered the product and when i opened the box i found that i received only the bottom piece when i asked if the remaining pieces could be shipped i was told that partial products are not shipped and that i would have to get an entirely new order fine other than i have to go through the hassle of waiting in line at the post office to return the wrong one except if they don t ship partial products then why did i receive a partial product to begin with i received the second mind you the replacement order and the same exact thing happened i received only the bottom piece so now i have to shlep both packages to the post office and waste my time for their error i suggest doing a search of metrokane cocktail shaker and you will find a couple other sites selling the same product one site even has 2 different sizes if anyone is looking for a smaller shaker,negative

this little clock measures 2 25 x 2 25 x 1 25 inches \( 5 5 x 5 5 x 3 3 cm \) there s one simple knob to set the time and alarm and the knob is easy to manipulate even without tiny fingers little glow in the dark accents on the hands help with night vision though they are not very bright to turn the alarm on just pop up the gray lever on the top smack it to shut the alarm off \( you could press it gently but it did just wake you up right \) there is no snooze feature but for 5 it s a great value as a travel alarm in case you nap in your car or as a backup should your primary alarm clock fail you you just need to add your own aa battery to get it running,positive

at first i thought this was a great product if you only make cheese fondue it is great the pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe the problem i ve had with mine is that it doesn t get beyond about 320 degrees the dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up it only got up to 323 degrees and wouldn t go any further so if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it won t do the job well i know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break away cord but this is ridiculous touch the darn thing and the cord falls free very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue people kept telling me that the cheese was getting hard because the cord had fallen off again next time i d get a pot that had a thermometer built in don t rely on the heat setting dial,negative

within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off this is not the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect this is my third \( and final \) bread machine the first two were breadman ultimates i should note that i make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average pretty much every morning the first breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail this was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time \( water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond \) i bought an new breadman ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems this time i took extremely good care of the pan \( letting it cool down no soaking \) because it s clearly the weak link in the system within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed making the machine useless currently it doesn t seem very easy \( or even possible \) to buy a replacement pan for the breadman at this point i was done with the breadman much as i didn t want to spring for the extra money for the zojirushi and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn t work the same in the new machine i didn t see an alternative and got one within 3 weeks the teflon in the zoji pan formed two blisters one is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact i have been extremely careful with the pan i wait for it to cool and then remove the baked on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers i don t let it soak at all this is clearly a manufacturing defect i have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the breadman ultimate 1 \) the top of the bread rarely gets brown i ve added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much 2 \) i don t understand what the crust control option does it doesn t seem to increase baking time which it does on the breadman so it doesn t make much sense 3 \) the programmability is very weak on the breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs 4 \) the programmability options are very limited you can t control the knockdown time between risings you can t add risings to the default three they do give you a lot of time control on the risings you can t separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle it s all one cycle when you turn off the preheat cycle this only affects the built in programs and not the custom ones and worst of all you can t bake for more than 70 minutes this is utterly ridiculous i m sure this is a safety feature but it means you can t correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth this is almost a killer limitation in my opinion for those other reviewers that are having issues with rising i ve determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount type and quality of yeast if you exactly follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast it should work okay this means you must use rapid rise yeast with the quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs even using fleischmann s instead of red star made a difference the breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations at this point i m done with bread machines they are a failed technology in fact teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology all you have to do is search for teflon \( polytetrafluoroethylene \) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance the manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination a direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees \( eg frying pans \) perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread i ve thought about this but there s no way to make a bread machine without teflon going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon there is just no other viable solution i love making bread every day and i m going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean i have to give up on this technology it s back to the occasional hand made loaf it s the only rational and healthy solution,negative

i bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday i m sure she s going to enjoy using it i had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing it was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied now i just have to get one for myself well my birthday is coming up in february,positive
just what i was looking for it is an odd sized cover that is hard to find great quality also,positive
nice compact size can be moved easily does freshen the air in the room noticeably on whisper setting is almost silent on turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life maybe would sleeping does shoot out air but does not blow with any force over time like a day all the air in our 20 x20 living area changes did have a noticeable plastic like new odor the first few days of use which wore off haven t had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks but it would be easy to clean,positive

my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we don t have to worry about the bottom falling out the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well,positive
i internet shopped for a week reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast easy job ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal the pitcher is thick solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 yes just 2 speeds i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous,positive
we have finished our basement and have a home theater room which is on the cool side we bought this heater to warm up the room and it works great,positive
hey i wasn t expecting much but seriously these are a pretty bad i bought two of these for my office the plastic shade comes all dented and looks so cheap the stupid pieces don t fit together right and so if you move it you have to pick it up from the base or it falls apart and the switch gets stuck pretty much all the time so that it s really hard to turn it i m the kind of person who enjoys fixing things so i ve taken it apart and tried to fix it and its still rotten the second lamp is just completely broken now after only 6 weeks save your money i m back on amazon looking for new lamps actually,negative
it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid while it lasted it worked fine,negative
a little disappointing we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we ve had for umpteen years and still works like new we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced we ve only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it,positive

if you re looking for a car harness that will keep your dog safe in an accident keep looking this harness might work to prevent your dog from bouncing around the car and possibly distracting the driver \( although i m not even confident it would hold up for that use with a big strong dog \) but i seriously doubt it would hold up even in a mild collision the dog is held in place using a few plastic buckles snaps which are not even very strong looking i have seen stronger snaps on regular dog collars plastic snaps like these would not hold up to the forces created in a collision if you want a safety harness that will protect your dog in an accident look for one that has actually been tested rated similar to human car safety devices,negative

amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered we hoped this one would be an exception it was but only in that it may be the poorest of them all ours buzzed loudly whenever in use never had a toaster buzz before we toast bread at least twice a day and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible it has no bagel setting \( which toasts the cut side more than the crust side \) so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast what s more it toasts completely unevenly one corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned and it s really annoying when a 4 slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently as far as looks go de longhi did just as bad a job the photos look cool but the crumb tray this unit sits upon is actually wider than the unit itself so there is a big uneven gap at the seam it s the lower line you see in the photos but they make it look real nice for that what you don t see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several mm from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown this makes it look broken like two pieces of something that no longer fit together if de longhi had spent even a second thinking about this they would have done the opposite the bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look \( we even went to a store yes a real store to confirm that they are all like this and they are \) also the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element there are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn t scratch the metal surface of the toaster however two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping and though they slipped right back in all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out \( only friction holds them in \) and you will loose them very quickly especially if you ever wash the rack we re happy to pay extra for a quality item even a toaster but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment final advice stick to the 20 toasters with functions such as bagel defrost and dual controls if it s ugly keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it this one looks broken performs poorly and costs a lot of money if you do buy this model maybe you ll get ours we returned it,negative

we travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we re sleeping the materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence the main body is plastic the metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door the serrations on the bar are not deep so don t promise much strength while none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in this one while prettily designed is overly expensive and unimpressive we re going to try a few others by the way in returning this item which we consider unsatisfactory amazon will charge us doubly the cost to return the item to amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our super saver shipping the end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer,negative
this is a very good product it is exactly as it is pictured and described clear insulated unbreakable and does not leave a ring on your table the company is very quick shipping along with great follow up and follow through a fine product and i will be ordering more,positive
we bought four sets of the victoria collection 600 thread count queen size the fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed it seems like that were made for a full size not queen size list this as a reject we are very very disappointed,negative
yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size \( but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact \) i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it,positive
i ordered the 45 piece place setting it had to be the quickest turn around i have ever come across ordered on a thursday had it on a monday everything was in perfect condition i am so pleased with amazon and the way they do business i will buy from them again the dishes are beautiful i couldn t be happier thank you,positive
we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won t work unfortunately because it s rigid it slides up a dog s neck very easily i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can t slide even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position a shrug a shake or simply walking a few steps is all it takes this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs is not going to work it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems the dog now has another negative association to the person consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying f quall,negative

i bought 4 of these light sets after seeing them in real simple magazine i thought they looked and seemed to be a perfect option for my kitchen wrong after only 15 minutes my brand new batteries \( 4 aa \) seemed to fade and within an hour dead i thought this is a mistake and bought new batteries again only to be upset when the same thing happened i called the manufacture about getting the adapter 4 8v it requires only to be told they do not sell to the public and i would have to track it down at radio shack etc well i have had no luck on that yet lots of 4 5v but no 4 8v i wish i could send these back they were a complete waste and if i ever find the proper adapters i will certainly use them but that defeats the purpose of me choosing wireless lighting doesn t it,negative
i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product and the euro pro was bad decision the product wouldn t even turn on much less work the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped the euro pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality boy was i wrong if you re purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro pro too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas a real disappointmen,negative
one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i d much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there s no washing machine that s also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i didn t hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it s difficult to push and feels like it s gripping to the floor it doesn t fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it s big fat part vacuum head and when you re finished it s a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you re supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you ve finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i don t review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i m hoping that they will one day,negative
my wife got this cuisinart classic toaster oven as a wedding gift we liked the appearance and had it on our registry we used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well toast was perfect and the oven cooked nice and hot we broiled meats and made all kind of things in it we found it hard to clean we would take the baking pan and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter i glued it back on with super glue it broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so i had to fix this plastic foot a few times then another problem arose the toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start so to make toast we just used the un timed bake function but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast still we lived with it then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working so it does not bake i think i knew this was going to happen because i would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever i turned the dial to bake for a while so therefore i think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last i would have expected better quality considering how long we have been making toaster ovens i think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls so like other reviews say it does cook well and evenly but it is hard to clean and does not last if i were to have rated the product before the problems started i would have given it 4 stars i wish that amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products we are now looking into t fall convection toaster oven but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts since writing my review above i tried to fix my oven to no avail but i have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke my recommendations are as follows since i know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this classic model product can over time get dirty and stop working i recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops rice cookers deep fryers pressure cookers or kitchen sinks especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease i recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location this might make the unit last longer the newer cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem i had or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways maybe 1 5 years is average life or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products from the reviews and my observations above i think the krups models and the improved cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me,negative
this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year,negative

this is a great sweeper but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery we bought one a couple of years ago from sears with a sears replacement warranty since then we have replaced it five times \( we really got our money s worth from the warranty at least \) it s getting to be a joke one day \( usually 2 3 months after we bring home the new one \) the rotor just stops turning and that s all she wrote next time we will purchase a different sweeper warranty or not,negative
i bought this for my husband s birthday b c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there carafes that leak coffeemakers that don t keep the right temperature etc this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5 star restaurant in fact they probably use a bunn the design is utilitarian not decoration and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee,positive

i am sure there is a lesson in my experience i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt pepper did not go where i wanted it i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube i am sad to say that i again found it s performance to be a big disappointment,negative
i just bought 2 of these tables to use as nightstands i have a very high bed and thought they would be too short and too small but they are perfect i love the extra storage at the bottom and the little drawer is very useful as well assembly took no time at all and the tables turned out extremely sturdy i am very pleased,positive
i must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan s nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after i began using it i m not talking about scratches which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning my pan began pock all over even up the sides where i rarely touch them i hung on to this pan for 3 years simply because i could not bear to part with it for the expense but eventually i had to treat it like my other all clad pans \( which i love \) and use full amounts of oil to cook it was no longer worth using although the reviewer who loves this pan was certain the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly that certainty is based on nothing but speculation i cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by all clad of course i could have asked all clad to replace it early on since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord but that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off,negative
i bought the previous model of this dehydrator i seriously would not even give this machine 1 star but there is no lower rating i bought mine a year ago used it once and the bottom heating element burned every single tray that i rotated to the bottom which you have to do in order to get anywhere the entire machine was worthless within a week of me owning it i did eat the beef jerky but that was the most expensive jerky i will ever make i called immediately to complain talked to a guy named saul who said the unit must be defective duh and he would send me a new unit and a return authorization i have gotten neither i am just out the money i have called back faxed mailed waited on hold and finally decided that ronco products are crap i will never give him or his company another cent buyers please research your purchases i see from other reviews that i am not the only one with a complaint buy a different machine,negative

the stool is great as far as it s ability to function it is quite thin which makes it easy to store it does have a safety issue my 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together i almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion my husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus no more pinched fingers i would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around i was right there when my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger,negative

it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design the pot does a good job perking coffee but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot i think that melitta should send out for nothing the glass top i am like the other reviews i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits,negative
i loved this when we first got it home i m handicapped and can t push a big vacuum so this was just right to pick up the top showing dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week but after two months the ac adapter cord just snapped in half it was oddly brittle from the very beginning i contacted euro pro who would not replace it under warranty so i ordered a new adapter from them \( which came to approx 15 \) with shipping now six weeks later they sent me a card saying due to overwhelming demand the adapter is on back order i wonder why they have such a large demand funnily enough the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it s last charge but no more i think it s time to bury it and move onto an old fashioned \( no power \) push sweeper,negative

read the description carefully it states the speaker range is 50 not the microphone my dog stood 10 away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn t trigger matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand even then it didn t go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower i also couldn t get it to just make the ultrasonic sound even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise not just me but my husband too so it s not a case of super human hearing on my part \) yes the timer option is very nice this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking but what good is the timer function if the microphone can t pick up the barking so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else,negative
i bought this heater at lowe s after returning another delonghi model to amazon it s great for a bedroom because it is practically silent the heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm that was the good news the bad news is that after a few months it broke down it turns off when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up as another reviewer said it is now an attractive retro paperweight but that s about it i was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having i m not going to bother after battling with delonghi over other retro products i m giving up i won t buy any of their stuff anymore by the way if you want a great silent heater try the bionaire micathermic model \( bnrbh3900u \) it doesn t have the snazzy styling of the delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year,negative
this is an excellent product if you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium and making huge messes walking in puddles etc and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks this product is for you don t waste your money on cheap suction devices and buy the python today \( sorry if i sound like an infomercial i m just an enthusiastic user \) the python attaches to your faucet you turn the water on full blast stick the suction tube end into your tank and you can drain your tank in minutes or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes then you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up \( again in minutes \) i have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank and what used to take me a whole day now takes about an hour \( to do all tanks \) i like that i can vacuum the gravel boy does this thing suck the waste up this will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great i was skeptical that this product would work but am so glad that i bought it now i actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it the directions are easy to follow even for people like me who are direction impaired,positive
most importantly this is small this is the same size as one person clay pot rice or bibimbap it is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout one cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion i have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around now that i have received my shipment i know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but i have grown to prefer the red it s so pretty it didn t arrive chipped or anything so there s not much to say about how it works just keep the heat between medium to low i broke it in by making hot milk \( from powder \) with banana so yeah as a pot it heats stuff up no leaks p s one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that i saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating yes i did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in i still don t know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but i hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies i think this try me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl,positive
after buying an aluminum i read about the leaching of the mayerial into the food and the health risks involved i was advised to spend the extra money since this is a stock item i took it to wal mart and traded it for a 6 quart stainless boy was i surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as i used to have a sixx litter european and a whole chicken fits just fine anyway i can t recommend this because of the material and because of the size if i could afford it i would go for the electric pressure cooker with at least an 8 quart size of stainless cuisinart or other brands check amazon around 150 and up you get what you pay for,negative
first the good news this is an extra heavy skillet with durable finish and good handles it easily handles two quarts up to the bottoms of the rivets and distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pan but for the bad news i would give this skillet four or five stars the bad news is that someone at the anolon plant damaged the pan before it was placed in the anolon carton neither the anolon box nor the outer ups shipping carton showed any damage when i received the skillet it wasn t until the the following day after i threw out the packaging that i noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly true i should have been more attentive when i received the pan but i never suspected anolon would package damaged goods i ll live with my mistake but will not purchase anything by anolon again,negative

i have used wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness but i sincerely regret having bought these sheets i purchased one set and after the 2nd wash there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on \( all the little balls felt scratchy \) my husband asked me why we were using the old sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn i was so suprised that i called wamsutta directly and the very nice lady there assured me that i must have gotten a defective set because that simply doesn t happen with their sheets so i exchanged them with an identical pair and the end of the story is that i am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing what a disappointment absolutely do not recommend and am now very wary of all wamsutta products,negative
this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container,positive
i received this blender for x mas last year it has some nice design features \( good heavy base to prevent tipping measuring cup built into the cap \) however i experienced the same problems that others here have the blender doesn t do well with anything thick like milkshakes it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart while it worked ok for a while the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months,negative
i have not tried to program the timer yet but as a heater this is one of the nicest i have had compact yet it puts out a nice even heat it is save in that the unit itself doesn t get red hot the ad says factory reconditioned yet it came in a new box and looks like new a super deal for auxiliary heating i use it to warm the livingroom to keep oil consumption down which it seems to have done so far without too big an increase in the electric bill,positive
i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave,negative

ive had this vacumn for about 2 years after about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way still has very good power bad news it doesnt move around easy it is like dragging an old tire around hard to turn and direct canister always rolls over the only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt and dont vacumn that often i guess because i dread using it i am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while but still like i said lots of power if you keep the filter clean,negative
we ve had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it it toasts consistently it accommodates all widths and the digital selector is great,positive
yes watch out pls always try to read review before buying its true the picture is deceiving but what i don t understand is why amazon keep using this picture,negative

ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months and it is fun weve already gone through a cleary water filter our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy and its fully programmable i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon water it down or add skim for a really nice froth i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime so far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past i should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides i would buy it,positive
the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good,negative
we ve had this for about five years the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery the battery is soldered to the circuit board they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost 20 each way i opened it up cut out the old battery and duct taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months cooks rice great though,negative
we got this rice cooker as a christmas gift we ve tried cooking rice in it three times and all three times the rice has burned it simply gets too hot like some of the other reviewers we added more and more water but it didn t help the cooker finally does kick into warm mode but by then it s too late we were thrilled when we realized it was non stick but what good is non stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible,negative
i bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day this is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves some of the honeycombs get a little crushed but i ve found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them reese s puffs and cheerios also came out without any crushing you have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh maybe this was in the directions but i missed it and learned the hard way but the kids figured out the caps easily and it s not a big deal for them,positive
at first i wasn t so sure if it would work then it really worked it was amazing now every day i can a chocolate covered item whenever i want,positive
we have 2 airedale terriers \( 55 lb dogs \) and 2 cats i originally bought a scat mat as a deterrent to the cats but it has since become a dog deterrent one of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we re not at home this is the only deterrent that has proven effective it keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down \( as she ll keep getting shocked if she stands there \) i feel comfortable using the product as i have been shocked by it many times myself \( generally i step on it by accident in the middle of the night \) make no mistake it hurts and you don t want to have it happen but it certainly isn t bad enough that i feel cruel using it this is my second scat mat as the other one stopped working because of that i m a bit concerned about the durability especially considering the cost that said however the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last \( no wires going to the battery that may become detached \) so i am hopeful that this one will last longer either way however it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money,positive
this is a great product for holding your knives my wife and i got a nice set of henckel knives as a wedding present i couldn t figure out how i could transport the knives along with the blade savers this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives,positive
this could well be the perfect dog toy especially if your dog is a queensland heeler with a knack for destroying plastic frisbees tennis balls etc in seconds flat i ve had one for a couple of weeks now and aside from some dirt spots it looks new it is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not so tender mercies of my dog s attention this disc is not only very durable it actually flies really well as something of a flying disc connoisseur i can t help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries plus it floats perfect,positive
soft comfortable perfect i came back to buy more i want to throw the rest of my sheets away i was reluctant to buy sheets without being able to touch them first but am so glad i took the chance,positive

excellent when you want to bake a small cake this is absolutely a great small just the right size of a cake form,positive
too bad i didn t come here first at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did it s too bad too because this thing is a technological marval except it s defective from the very start my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is ideal so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water doesn t boil \( add salt \) or if it boils too rapidly \( add distilled water \) this will prevent spurting boiling over and overheated reservoirs the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already the unit boils like the bejesus on low putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking reset refill light i tried 4 times and even called tech support \( they were pretty clueless are you listening bionaire \) it s really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you can t tilt it to fix the problem \( most warm mist are designed that way for some reason,negative
i have found this item to be very helpful i only have 1 arm and dust pans are not an option now when i spill something i can clean it up on my own,positive
bought this at target returned it the next day not even close to the quality of b d t r o s from even a few years ago summed up in one word cheesy is the appropriate descriptor,negative
these mikasa spoons go perfectly with your demitasse or espresso cups very delicate with nice finish we enjoy them every time we use them,positive
i purchased this coffee maker and in three months time threw it out what a piece of you can never get a decent hot cup of coffee \( it is lukewarm at best \) and the carafe not only breaks so you have to replace it but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup what a dissapointment this machine is mr coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor i would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone the only nice thing i can say about it is the programmable timer worked i would not give this coffee maker one star but that was the lowest rating available if it were up to me i would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating,negative
this is great easy set up dishwasher safe \( top shelf only \) and super quiet \( there is a very faint humm \) our cats went right over to check it out it is kinda big but i expected that from the picture the only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher 5 stars i d give it more if i could,positive
it is a very pretty maker and coffee is made under perfect conditions the price is good through amazon just make sure you use suggested filters the other do not work \( learned from experience \) if premium coffee is your thing and pretty is a bonus this maker is the answer,positive
i bought the machine about 2 weeks ago and it took me about 5 min to read the instructions and use the machine sorry but one would have to be an idiot not to understand how to use it i love its versatility e g espresso coffee or pods regular water or add bottle \( for those whose tap water is bad \( comes with an adapter \) \) froth maker for capuccino or steam water for tea it sure will draw wows from your friends as long as you remember to run a cup of water through before each time you use it your espresso should be the perfect temperature took me some time to realize why it was lukewarm the only bad thing \( why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars \) i have to say about the granos is that in order to remove the portafilter i e the part with the handle holding the coffee you have to use force but maybe after a few months it will loosen up a bit and things will be easier all in all i am completely satisfied with its user friendliness crema temperature and versatility,positive
this cooks bacon crisp without any mess or spatter just place a couple of paper towels over the bacon i was using my george foreman grill but this is easier to clean,positive
poor quality the cover leaks i had to return it back do not buy,negative
after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso \( and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines \) i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it my main concern was how hot the coffee would be and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee i ve read reviews about the noise it makes and after having the deloghi product the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all we are very happy with it buy it you ll be happy too,positive
i bought this as a upgrade from the glass carafe that came with my aroma control machine i was tired of burnt coffee due to the burner burning it this carafe keeps coffee steaming hot for hours a great upgrade,positive
the distribution of heat in this pan is super great for gravies and sauces i have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking stir frying can reduce fats and is usually a pretty healthy way to eat a wide variety of veggies and other delightful ingredients i even use it to pop brown rice or basmati rice ever tried hot puffed rice sometimes i eat it just like pop corn but often just for a different way of serving rice this pan is deep enough with or without the lid to keep it from popping out of the pan \( depending how much you start with \) it is also useful to cook or finish foods in the oven up to 500 degrees and it is kitchenaid i expect it to outlast me,positive
i was very impressed with the infomercials on this product and was about to buy the set before i read a very detailed and thorough online review at http www epinions com content 180924944004 the reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product among her pet peeves things do stick to the product use a flour cooking spray for better results odors do stay with the product not easy to clean the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps size of the pieces are small the pieces are so flexible that if you don t place the food neatly in the pan you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results you can slice through the product easily guarantee is shakey at best and so on there are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light and more importantly i personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis i for one definitely will not buy this product please consider this recap of another s review a public service buyer beware,negative
the krups xp 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now with no problems to speak of we use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily and each time it has been very good a notice i would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided the provided tamper is plastic and can be wobbly but i am very satisfied with the product,positive
not functional bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it impossible to use the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly also it came in a box that was damaged and taped together \( not the shipping box the polder box that the product comes in \) looks like someone returned it previously \( probably for the same reasons \) and it was then sent to me i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted time to throw it out waste of money,negative

was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven,negative
the design is great the function is not always difficult to get both in the same package i m going to return it it toasts unevenly toast is not crisp it burns a corner of the toast,negative
as i tend to nurse a cup of tea at the office for a while i decided to purchase this product this after looking around for a good desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug such a product just doesn t seem to exist check the amazon customer ratings i had one a number of years ago and it was lousy \( had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap but no one has \) i purchased this mug just about a month ago it s so good i had to share the secret and even if an improved electric warmer did exist i don t think i d bother with its cord and risks given how good this is i m sorry to see though that it s no longer available through amazon \( perhaps elsewhere on the web \) i can make a mug of tea \( a generous 20 oz \) around 10a m and even by mid to late afternoon 4 or 5p m it s still warm enough to enjoy and that s after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough to drink indeed if there s a fault with it it s almost too efficient if you use boiling water for the tea and want to take a sip right after you ve finished brewing though called a travel mug it won t fit into any auto cupholder i ve seen it s really perfect for a desk it s relatively low \( taller than a typical ceramic mug though \) the base is nice and wide and there s a ring of rubber silicone type material \( which has not scuffed anything on my desk \) around the edge of the bottom that really is non slip between these features it seems quite stable the removable black plastic top \( friction secured with the typical silicone type o ring around the edge \) allows you to move the opening anywhere you want to use left or right handed there s a simple slide to open close the drinking aperature the interior is also stainless steel so no plastic taste even with boiling water inside the outside remains virtually at room temperature \( as you d expect given its thermal efficiency \) my only complaint \( minor \) is that it is not dishwasher safe \( and i haven t tested it \) but it s easy to hand wash with the wide mouth you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom i have several inexpensive auto insulated mugs \( key word here i think is inexpensive \) that are truly underwhelming so initially i didn t have high expectations for this but it really is fantastic if you want a hot beverage to keep for several hours on your desk this is for you no regrets,positive
if i could give this product 0 stars i would read the negative reviews folks and be forewarned i believed the positive reviews and ignored the negative ones much to my exasperation when i plugged my handsome new oven in the little red digital display numbers came on right away hmmm so far so good but according to the instructions you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell sooo the owner s manual says to push the bake button on the dashboard which in turn lights the pilot lid light on the display after which you can set time and temp so i push the bake button and nothing happens no lid light comes on nothing zilch zippo so i then push the temp and time lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up still nothing i unplugged it and and plugged it in again thinking that maybe somehow i had screwed that up while listening for the beep the owner s manual said should happen whence the unit is plugged in zilch zippo nothing no beep no bake lid light tried pusing the temp and time buttons again nada tried unpugging it again and doing the whole shebang all over again still nothing it just sat there and grinned at me about this time i figured out that my unit was also dead on arrival at least you can get a parcel paid bill of lading printed off from the amazon website for a defective product return saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product you have already paid for and now must wait weeks to get a refund on amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse and run them over with a forklift,negative
this purchase came with 3 stackable racks i thought it was only one rack it stores very easily in a compact space and works well i don t know if it rusts since i have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it,positive
the first use wasn t too bad it cut things well but the lock locks too easily without something even touching it so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use safety is nice but that is just annoying the biggest problem is the coil spring is not stainless steel so the inside of it rusts even if you take it apart for each washing once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult toclose the shears making cutting a real pain literally i soak the spring regularly in rust remover but i can not use it no more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand my prior shears lasted for 10 years but these i need to replace after a couple of months,negative
this came broken the packaging was not good damage good don t make happy custome,negative
this unit can only dry half of what it can wash which is not that much it takes a total of 4 1 2 hours to do one load of laundry if you only put 11lbs of wash in i have a family of five and i am over run with laudry because of this machine,negative

this is horrible at keeping coffee hot it gets cold quick buy another brand i bought this model and a larger zojirushi 1 9 liter stainless steel model at the same time they both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch the 1 9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button also it is the worst stainless steel i have ever seen it stains instantly and for ever i had another zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic but something has happened over the last 10 years their quality has really gotten bad,negative
i live in sw florida everything down here rusts even the nails in the walls i am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives amazon has a deal i couldn t refuse 90 steak knives for only 29 99 i bought two sets and i couldn t be happier it will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight after using big clunky steakhouse style wooden handle knives for so many years my husband might not be as enthusiastic as i am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well i will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp but i don t keep my knives in boxes no storage room i have a lot of stainless steel german knives and i consider them to be the best i have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there handy and nice looking these will complete my collection of nice looking knives on that wall handy where i can just reach up and grab them you just can t beat the price but if you don t like them you can return them amazon is the best place i have found to buy everything i need for my kitchen bar none i will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures,positive
while cute this little pan is difficult to use there s no room to use a spatula so you d better like the eggs cooked through you can t flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it s so small that it won t fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers,negative

we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the rechargable battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one,negative
at first we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner after one year however it started sounding like a jet engine the turbo nozzle had broken i live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things and when i ordered a new turbo nozzle they sent a mini it turns out that the actual replacement nozzle listed at 29 99 a year ago now costs 125 00 the explanation i got was prices are subject to change without notice now i m stuck with a 5 inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me plus the cord which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button creeps in while we re vacuuming and when we press the button too i love it at first but i ll never buy another electrolux it s not well made and they don t stand behind their product,negative

i have only had it for a few days but moving up from a krups pump system with only 1050w of heating this unit rocks it used to take me about 10 minutes to make a latte with the krups as it took forever to heat uo and never made enough steam this unit heats very fast and makes fantastic steam for the frother which works fantastic minus the complaint everyone has the frother is way to low to the ground they fixed this with the evolution model watch the video the tamping and normal uses need to be followed very closely i have to use the perfect crema device to make crema which it does great this unit also can be used to heat water for tea in like 2 mins which is pretty cool you just fire up the unit wait till it heats then flip the espresso switch not the steam switch with the steam adjuster already open then hot water comes from the frother and boom tea the drip tray is worthless and is supposedly fixed in the evolution model but for 200 this machine is amazing very professional level equipment the abs shell is pretty flimsy but if it stays on the counter which mine does it will be fine i don t need to spend another 300 for the stainless model even though i would if i has a nicer kitchen just so it matched \( i rent but still have really nice appliances \),positive
i have never used any other dehydrator s and found this very simple to use clean store and the price was great plus it makes my house smell great when i m using it so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i m finding it enjoyable to use,positive
this pillow looks simple enough but there must have been a lot of research put into inventing it the dogbone \( medium size about 16 w i don t remember specific dimensions \) instantly relieved many aches i had in my neck without forcing me to lie down in a flat position \( which often gives me a headache and makes it impossible to read while lying down \) i d been to the doc quite a few times for the back neck problems i ve had lately but no rx worked quite as well as this delightful cushion my only issues with it are cleaning \( stuffing s packed very tight so i d rather not try it out in the washer for fear of mold mildew i spray it with disinfectant every once in a while instead \) the outer material \( an optional moisture wicking or allergen reducing pillowcase would be nice \) however i bought it based on earlier reviews and i don t regret it,positive
a collegue of mine raved about it she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office i tried it for a day but was not convinced either way then i bought the largest model and tried it at home i used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the acid test i used it in the toilet room closed the door and let it sit there for 8 hours when i inspected the room i could still smell what i smelled 8 hours earlier and i so wanted it to work the other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor \( as does a hepa air filter \),negative
the first dishwasher that i received from etronics was dented dirty and looked as though it had been used i complained they picked it up and one month later i got the replacement it wasn t in much better shape but i kept it anyway because i was tired of waiting the dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes and although it cleans well the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made and it leaks even with teflon tape i would not make this purchase again,negative

the pans look very nice and very durable but they are not save your money do not buy this i had to put them through the dishasher a second time to remove some more of the sticky residue on the bottom of the pan from the label when they came out of the dishwasher there were rust spots all over them i am going to try and return mine as soon as i get a chance i never even got to use the pans before they rusted it should be noted that a \) the pans were never left soaking in water or in the sink b \) there was not anything even the tiniest bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have rubbed off rust onto them or anything like that horrible horrible pans they should be ashamed to make or sell these,negative

order the wok and got it damaged \( off shaped \) the packaging is horrible basiclly they put the bare wok in the box filled with the giant air bubbles the wok can move around freely in the box guess the damage is caused during shipping return and reordered the typhoon carbon steel wok similar size and design 3 cheaper when i got it i am very pleased with the quality \) properly packaged plastic cover on the top sheet of paper on the bottom fitted in a box designed for it \) thick steel 2 5mm rather than 1 8mm from joyce chen \) handles are welded on the wok so no dead spot when cleaning \) seasoning instruction are well documented in 8 different languages even thou i use my own seasoning way not like joyce chen s one thin sheet of paper with not so clear instruction overall joyce chen s wok is like the one you can get from chinatown supermarket and typhoon one is like from macy s,negative
we purchased the delonghi based on its ease of cleaning \( 4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher \) after the third use the plastic part that holds the heating element in place melted off the base delonghi service was apologetic and promised to send a replacement part asap although the part was out of stock that was in september almost 6 months ago parts are still backordered i returned the unit to lowes in frustration got a new unit and it too melted on the first use returned it for credit do not consider this unit,negative

impressive machine overall i ve had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch looking around on the internet this seems to be fairly common i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine the attachments are great for hard floors and furniture i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point even the refurbished one,positive
i really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush unfortunetly it is just messy annoying and takes up counter space when you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction if the cereal is too big \( honeycomb size \) it doesn t come out easily if it is too small \( fruity pebbles \) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere i definetly would not buy this product again at one point i even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away the time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter,negative
this pan is a good buy and a wonderful size for 2 3 member families although not as heavy as some of the french copper pans i have many of the commercial calphalon pieces and love the handle the pan is definately heavier than cheap quality pans and the stainless interior is just what i wanted for acidic based cooking \( tomato sauces etc \) as far as scratches well what do you expect if you use it it is going to get some scratches the brushed exterior helps hide some of the outside marks though some have complained about scratches on the other calphalon hard anodized but most of the time they really aren t scratches but rather aluminum marks from the rivets when stacking in any case they are easily removed with scotchbrite and some cleaner enjoy p s i chose the no shipping cost delivery and received the pan in just 4 days,positive

this is a great idea but i think it might need more tweaking the reservoir holds a lot of water which is good but there is no filter so any cat hair stray food or whatever your 18 month old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl then it sits there usually after sinking to the bottom until you dig it out also with mine at least you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear a shame since the cat really did like the few bubbles i was able to coax out if this somehow filtered the water and made bubbles i d be all over it \( like cat hair on a pastel couch \),negative
i love this item perfect for storing pet food special screw type tops that seals food bugs mice cannot get in easy to wash let it air dry my only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it so those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed over all the best in food storage i know i just about bought them all,positive
having used hoover products in a commercial environment for many years i have had great service from them providing many years of dependable and powerful operation we were excited to try out this new hoover model one of the first things i have noticed about it over the previous windtunnel model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum this may bother some but i see it as a testament to it s improved build quality over the gen 1 windtunnel this machine is very powerful and it s dual turbine motor has a confident sound i ll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is it is a nice feature though i ll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is update after having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 1 \) lacks a bag full indicator the bag filled on this machine and then busted \( unknowlingly \) at the top around the bag collar stuff went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter it took another vacuum to clean the mess up in the future i will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle indicating how full the bag is getting 2 \) the cord rewinder is a nice feature but truly lacks quality it will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance a stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference 3 \) dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head not that it presents a problem but it s unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns,positive

i initially bought this coffeemaker because i remembered my dad s sunbeam silex type coffeemaker it made great coffee and so does the bodum problem with the bodum is that i had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material the folks at bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem i am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if i continue to have a problem,negative

as a vintner we remove the co2 from the wine as part of our process this device uses co2 to pop the cork very clever however this minor introduction of co2 is insignificant and will vent quickly at times there is an off taste like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine let it breath for a while 5 minutes or so and it seems ok this device works well on corks but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective rew,positive
none of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff i bought this and the 8 fry pan 2 months ago and except for the bottoms still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day i even used a bacon press \( cast iron \) in it every time i cooked bacon and a couple of times i accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left hubby stacked knives and forks inside then topped it off with 6 dinner plates i thought it was done for scratches and nicks everywhere but no not a single mark my calphalon commercial nonstick \( which hit the trash already \) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr old did that i must admit though that i do not use metal utensils in it nor do i put in a dishwasher since i won t have one til the kitchen is remodeled overall though just from what abuse it has gotten i m very impressed and will buy more my advice don t mess with the rest buy the best and this is it going to try the wok next wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it,positive
i just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum it cuts the cleaning time in half from 8 10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop and spraying the box down down to only 2 minutes it s just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes litter maid products i ve seen and the price is reasonable i wish i had this for my previous cats i ve owned,positive

i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away she would use a flashlight to do little reading well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes but it does do the job,positive
hunter fan arrived in 2 days from amazon com and immediately i noticed the weight of the fan heavy just the way i like it unpacked this beauty and plugged her in and off she went with a beautiful sound i love the 3 wing blade and the speed variation is great from barely running to blow your hat off we love it keep up the good work hunter i intend to buy one for a christmas gift also,positive
we bought these for our two girls \( 2 and 5 \) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great for a while now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time \( 5 months since we ordered \) they haven t been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat same issue with the bowls ymmv but when 3 out of 4 are dead i think there is a problem,negative

i had researched this product for juicing ability and power i ended up buying this one and after using it twice the motor just shut off i returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement i decided to try juicing carrots and celery and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again i might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it if you are juicing small things like berries with larger vegetables fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade i know i read these bad reviews and said oh that won t happen to me but it did i hope you choose a different juicer,negative
this is by far the best toaster we ve ever owned it does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional so i don t know how it works yet but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side a fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation the bagels we toasted in it were just perfect the microwave is large enough inside for my purposes which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting i never use microwave popcorn so i can t say how well it does in that area but the frozen burrito i cooked last night came out terrific regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving i think what the company is referring to is the fact that while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster this does indeed save space not to mention an electrical outlet overall i m very pleased with it but haven t had it long enough to speak to its longevity i can tell you that it s almost worth buying for the toaster alone,positive

i m very happy with this mixer it arrived in pristine condition even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints i bought it mainly for bread making and after a certain amount of practice i m turning out great products i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard my only gripe is not with the machine but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured i got the hd i have researched as much as i can and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting but i just don t understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying seems kind of elementary to me,positive

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products the enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently for this reason it is recommended to use on low to medium heat there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay otherwise cooking with high heat may cause food to stick discolor the enamel coating or cook the food unevenly remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide \( rust \) doesn t add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain it adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically this pan holds 5 1 4 quarts of food measures 9 3 4 x 14 x 3 inches internally and weighs 10 2 pounds 5 1 4 quarts will typically feed 8 10 people when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3 4 full any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac n cheese while not so desirable for other dishes add the le creuset 9 x 11 1 2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash lasagna scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials heck cast iron doesn t seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of pros extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10 2 pounds,positive

i grind beans for my coffee every morning i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder sold the old grinder in a garage sale i do regret buying this grinder it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 my main complaint is that it is messy the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it also coffee grounds are everywhere i always have to use a cloth to clean up not a good buy,negative

admittedly i am a bit of a knife buying nut i love kitchen knives and own chef s knives and santuko knives from wusthof henckels kyocera and furi this calphalon katana 6 inch chef s knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance wise i like the way the handle is shaped it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious i love the way it looks too for the price i d say you can t go wrong i really like it a lot i have only had it for a few weeks though but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we ll see how well it resharpens when the need arises,positive

we already owned the 7 inch santoku knife purchased locally from a kitchen retailer and loved it we were a little hesitant at first since we ve only ever had cheaper knives but as soon as we felt it in our hands and tried the knife we were sold still the 7 inch is a little big for small jobs so we decided to get this 4 inch paring knife i coupled a gift certificate with an amazon com kitchen coupon promotion and was able to get the 4 inch paring knife and the 8 inch bread knife for a very good price this should pretty much complete our knife set from my experience these three knives are versatile enough for almost any job the 4 inch paring knife specifically is great for smaller jobs where the santoku would be awkward it s balanced perfectly stays sharp and since it s a single piece it cleans easily and you don t have to worry about the handle breaking all in all great knife and highly recommended,positive

i bought these molds for my crystal light drinks so that i could have a more nutritious dessert option the molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money the plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom impossible to get back out and the taste will go with it i have fun using these and they were reasonably priced,positive
this juicer is extremely heavy made of industrial type metal parts but it s poorly machined and assembled the heavy parts don t fit together well and the juicer is wobbly and unstable despite it s heaviness i am sending this back without using it once becuase there s no way to adjust the parts and it s too unstable to use as is also it really is almost impossible to pick up and move due to the weight without straining your back finally like a reviewer of the orange x large size juicer i find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places it seem like the kind of company where to get a good product you d have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one,negative
this is a very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner if you just need to clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it will perform great should you actually try to use the beater brush attachment you will be very dissappointed i bought this cleaner for the purpose of cleaning my curtians and stairs i own two cats and virtually all of my in laws are allergic to them everytime they come i have to clean the house top to bottom my upright vacuum \( dirt devil vision lite model 008650 \) weighs a ton and was not designed to use on stairs i thought this little cleaner might be just the trick the brush worked great the first several times i used it but after about 20 uses it began to slow down i cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw the initial performance again eventually it stopped working at all i urge you to buy something else if the beater brush is a selling point for you,negative

i bought this for my husband three years ago and he absolutely loves it in fact many people who come to our house ask about it as the coffee is superb we are very picky about our coffee tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years i would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model the coffee is usually hot throughout the day \( depending on how much is in it of course \) as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee we have never had the first problem with boilovers leaking implosions \( huh \) etc in fact i m getting one for my daughter and her husband for christmas as they always admire ours,positive

the bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status this causes the fabric to be so thin you can just about see your hand through it also out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled the good news is that the red border color that i chose did not bleed in the washer further they did not shrink at all i don t know how they feel to sleep on as they are for a guest bed for occasional use only just by the way they look if i were to use them daily i would have returned them,negative

this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen it s the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons you ll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant good stones are expensive though i think it s worth it for such a fine knife,positive

it appears that the viatek product \( bark stop pro \) is related to the lentek design \( pc16 asin b0002q89o6 \) they are based on a common design by a lentek engineer i have used \( tried \) the viatek bark stop pro and it definitely does not work my experience was the same as another reviewer of the lentek pc16 who noted that the unit only works on the audible setting dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ultrasonic setting furthermore it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds banging doors wind noise etc this really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction quality i ve tried two different units and they both do not work the negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks,negative
i have nice sharp blades i sliced veggies and got all these tiny little plastic hairs that the cutting mat gave off as i sliced it up along with my veggies had to toss them these mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough or any other purpose other than for what they are made for chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects for the price it was worth testing them out,negative

the refill accessory \( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes \) definitely cuts the refill maintenance in half since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher safe and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected,positive

was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven,negative
i just love this garlic roaster it roasts up to 3 med size bulbs of garlic in less than 30 min i like the idea of a mini roaster so i do not have to heat up my convection oven for such a small quanity of garlic it is easy to clean and has great appeal in the kitchen it has an automatic light and lets you know when roasting is complete it cooks to perfection while lightly roasting the garlic \( top facing down \) and i like to use a cloth to handle the hot garlic and squeeze them into my mashed potatoes if you allow the garlic to cool off the cloves firm up and are great eaten with a desert fork i use spanish roja garlic in this roaster and it comes out perfect every time i have used this machine for 5 months now and have since purchased another one as a gift,positive
i just got this waffle maker and have already made a perfect batch of honey wheat blueberry waffles i can t believe how easy it was and how fat and fluffy they came out i used krusteez mix because i was out of eggs and used frozen blueberries the mix told me to add a little oil for waffles the booklet told me to plug it in and wait for the green light i sprayed it with pam i poured in 1 2 cup of the mix on each side added blueberries to the top closed it flipped it and that was it the booklet says they are done when the steam stops they were brown before the steam stopped so i pulled them out no sticking no spills i almost purchased an 80 00 model but decided to get this one after seeing all of the reviews what a great deal,positive
some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 is defective out of the box so far i ve made 40 shots of espresso and 10 steamed ciders and i ve been very pleased with the product i ve been working on improving my technique and now i think the espresso is excellent i prefer my homemade shots to the stuff i buy at starbucks and most other cafes though this could be due to delusional pride in my own amateur baristaship also i may be over excited because i d wanted an espresso machine for so long the negatives \( so far \) are that it looks like there are is a fair amount of ongoing maintenance cleaning of the machine though i doubt that this is unique to this brand also as others have mentioned the espresso spout is low so i drink my coffee out of ceramic ramikins \( although aren t low spouts authentic \) also i haven t gotten the steamer working quite right and i always end up with cappuccinos \( all foam \) even if i m trying to make a latte hopefully i ll get better with time as for reliability i ve only made 40 shots so i can t speak to the long term quality but so far so good and heck 40 espresso drinks at starbucks would ve cost me over 120 by now although making it at home still isn t free if you use the convenient pods it s still about 50 cents a shot and illy beans are expensive \( right now i m using an unground dark roasted kona which is deep and very smooth \),positive
the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again,negative

i ordered two of these great fiesta handled carafes in black i plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so i had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase i have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces i was not happy when i received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips \( where the white under the glaze shows through \) as well as scratches in the glaze \( which i have never seen before and can t imagine what happened to put them there \) in my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds i love the pieces i m just dissappointed with the quality of the finish i also received a black covered butter which was blemish free,positive

i ve had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sight protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger made mostly for show blocks would if you re looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger that s just my opinion i could be wrong,positive
after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf with an interesting pattern on the crust my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf and much more rustic natural than using a loaf pan the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old fashioned way when it s done rising carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre heated bread stone in the oven the loaves look and taste great,positive

what an awesome product heavy duty and sturdy you d never know it was an assemble at home item it s a quality piece of furniture it s on wheels which is a good thing because it is surprisingly heavy let s start at the top the butcher block top it s three inches thick and as such it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart it is made of fine high quality asian hardwoods the finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil the next is the cart itself immediately under the butcher block top there is a 2 deep drawer it s large and deep enough to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice the pull handle on the drawer is fashioned out of brushed chrome beneath the drawer there is a shelf surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods adding a modern look matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors the pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish the cabinet is large enough to hold an entire set of dinnerware \( as in my case where i have eight place settings that include dinner and luncheon plates fruit and soup bowls and more \) finally heavy duty professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing the two in the front are locking to prevent stubbed toes the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit the easy to follow directions for assembly \( which are diagrammed and in english \) call only for a philips screwdriver a hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts i used an electric screwdriver for both the philips screws \( 14 in all \) and the hex bolts \( after i found the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver \) i can happily report that all pieces fit together easily \( no struggling to match up this piece with that piece \) and all holes are pre drilled the drawer requires assembly also the runners for the drawer are already attached you must put together the front sides and back of the drawer with screws \( again all holes are pre drilled \) a word of advice regarding assembling the drawer follow the directions where it says to put the screws in only halfway before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer i made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble sliding the bottom into the assembled front back and sides it s a snug fit once i loosened the screws enough the bottom easily popped into place and i was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws i have only one other thing to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright you must lift the butcher block and set it down on the top of the cart at this point you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart and they re pointing upward these screws will fit into four pre drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block you must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart because the butcher block is so heavy you may want to have help but what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture it ended up being ikea sells a similar item for twice the money i give the home styles double door kitchen cart with butcher block top 5 stars because of the beauty of the product and its better than a bargain price,positive

being a wine lover i ve used all kinds of corkscrews from your basic twist model to the kind with the wings to the two pronged kind finally i received the screwpull as a gift and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end as others have said the screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up so there s no actual pulling whatsoever all you do is simiply turn the easy to use lever at the top of the device in almost 10 years of usage the screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try \( probably because i started too close to the edge \) simply starting over solved the problem spend a little more money to buy the screwpull and you ll never need to buy another corkscrew again highly recommended,positive

i bought this sheet set the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son he too loves star wars and as i read the other reviews im nodding my head these sheets feel like burlap i have washed them regularly since december with no improvement they dont fade though which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 polyester and only 30 cotton very stiff and scratchy,negative
my company bought one of these to replace the similar capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after n years after 2 days the led readout of the functional information stopped working the machine continues to operate but you can t tell what s going on how much water it will use for your particular cup etc very disappointing we ll see how good the warranty repair is and report back to you after we experience that,negative
this is probably my favorite mug it easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup it comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim the best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over even hard corners don t seem to phase it it s also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat s efforts to tip it over the odd shape also has downsides though it won t fit in any cup holder i ve ever come across but that doesn t matter much since it won t tip over no matter where you set it if you don t rinse it out immediately it can be difficult to clean later due to the shape if you don t have small hands you may need a bottle cleaning brush also i imagine if you had more than one of these mugs they d be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space despite this it s still a great mug in fact i m going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too,positive
i ve always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for 1 keeps the beverage hot for hours 2 when sealed it does not leak at all 3 easy to drink from and dribble free 4 suitable for right and left hand drinkers 5 fits into most car cup holders 6 clips to straps loops handles to carry easily even when filled 7 easy to clean and stays stain smell free 8 rubber accents provide non slip grips and doesn t make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table 9 high quality construction for durability 10 it looks really cool this mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug i look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug finally a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user this is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price,positive
i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than 5 same concept just a lot cheaper two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they re holding i m sure it s pinhole sized if you re hanging something that weighs a few ounces \( in which case you don t need this use a pushpin \) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin sized but it is a heavy shelf the hole is still way smaller than the hole i d make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks \( the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang \) this is a small detail but if you need two of these things and you don t do it right your object is gonna be crooked but on the bright side you won t have a huge hole to patch when you redo it recommended product \( but look around for the knockoffs,positive

i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot,negative

as far as whisks for non stick surfaces go the silicone encased wires are very flexible a far cry from the hard thick plastic whisks with only a few wires they are ideal for non stick surfaces except for one problem the silicone is soft and not durable after a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer the silicone gets easily cut the silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose i have been very careful but this works out to probably 2 each time i used it,negative
if you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner then you will love this one i bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large \( and heavy \) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair because of the small bagless chamber you have to empty it frequently so i wouldn t count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner i wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs specifically to pick up pet hair and this vacuum exceeded my expectations i tried the shark a similar model made by fantom and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does \( stay away from the fantom cordless by far the worst \) i don t think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did overall this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean ups or to maintain pet hair free area rugs one suggestion use the carpet setting even on bare floors the brushes are high enough so they won t scratch bare floors but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush i found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless i used the carpet setting the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying,positive
this nifty piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so i got it i really wanted to get the air o swiss one but alas it cannot be found or shipped to canada weirdly so far i am less than impressed took me forever to even get it working the constant resetting is tiring i did find a solution \( initial anyway \) you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir \( where the round filter is \) and then it works the noise it makes is not easy to get used to no matter how tired you are i am trying it for one night then if i can t sleep i will return it it s not worth the money my advice save up and get the air o swiss,negative

if i had to do it over again i would try a different mat \( something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic \) pros 1 reduces tracking somewhat 2 more attractive than other litter mats 3 doesn t take up too much space cons 1 my cat doesn t like it most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet 2 it s too smal,negative

before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i ve tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud don t waste your mone,negative

here i have a refurbished palinato x3 textured very hardy stainless and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws 170 to start \( 6 mo warranty \) but let me correct one point made in these reviews the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic a rather new trend that works quite well the steam nob as well seems to be this material all around this is quite an improvement on the x1 more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x1 cups warm quicker also it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better still it s important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming fat content just makes more fat not true foamed milk,positive

these cups are high quality stainless steel don t worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink i was surprised by their weight and long handles my old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups these miu cups are extremely sturdy the handles on my old cups were more typical too while these miu cups all have very long handles \( 4 5 \) at first i didn t like the asthestics of the handles nor the fact that the smaller ones don t stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates however when i needed to scoop something out of a small mouthed container i quickly reversed my opinion of these handles cricisms the interior has perpendicular corners i prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying still it doesn t make much of a difference also while they re not hard to store they don t stack all that well so they ll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers \( 5 5 \) i suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease \( \) for the 5 cups i m extremely satisfied i feel these are top of the line the 7 cup set is overpriced \( \) so definitely go with these i don t understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2 3 and 3 4 cups just use the 1 3 cup twice or the 1 4 three times or eyeball the 1 cup \(,positive

my 13 year old cat was limping for a few days off and on and my vet said it was probably arthritis a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try it really made a difference he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake he was so happy and so was i on my vet s recommendation i continued giving him one tuna flavored capsule each day sprinkled over his food as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis and buying it from amazon saved me about 2 3 of the cost from the vet,positive

i also had a problem with the coating flaking off within the first week of using it the only reason i still use it is because i m a poor college student that got it as a gift in the first place and can t afford a new one after scrubbing the inside bottom of the wok furiously i managed to get all the flakes off and then some the lid is made of thin aluminum and has bent almost completely out of shape awful product do not buy this wok,negative
my wife wanted two sets to match our new family room decor well they turned out to be so beautiful that we have replaced our good formal china with this set really gorgeous pattern and color the red has a slight orange cast and is not a perfect match for a more maroon red the sets arrived in perfect condition although the two outside box were very beat up excellent packaging a fabulous deal,positive

some how my previous review text got a little glitched up but suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut the manufacture of these knives is well below the quality i expected it s the first time i ve been totally disappointed we re returning the knives because they are not worth the money really they look great in the picutre but they are very poor quality why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars,negative

we purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use we make probably 20 30 cups of coffee a day our problems began the first week after receiving it the machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam which lattes shouldn t have so customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy we called the manufacturer s customer service and were rudely brushed off for a small business like us it is hard to close for 2 3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service so we had to deal with it another problem came up 3 4 weeks later when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate just to steam milk at the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours which we did it did not shut off for 1 day the next day the problem started again i perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily so you can not say that the machine is being neglected we are very disappointed with this machine for the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite understanding and helpful now we are looking for another machine a back up one to be able to send impressa z5 for service,negative

this toaster oven is perfect i have had this oven for about 6 months and had enjoyed cooking meals in the summer months without heating up the entire house i have even cooked a whole chicken in it this oven cooks food evenly and i have had no problems with it at all i highly recommend this product update i still have this toaster oven and use it almost everyday i still absolutely love it and don t understand why everyone else seems to have issues with it i don t know what i would do with out this oven i have owned it for over 3 years and it still works perfect i recently cooked a prime rib in it and it turned out fabulous,positive
the first time i used this waffle maker i was very disappointed and regretted the purchase however i gave it another chance the second time i used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great my husband said they were even better than the ones i used to make to avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out i lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it,positive

corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo,negative

i bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago used 2 x daily and cleaned every month with either vinegar or special cleaner unfortunately it began leaking water from outside top of machine very poor quality machine i just threw mine out in the trash bin just got tired of constantly having to mop up after it don t buy this coffeemaker a waste of good money \( i paid 99 99 \),negative
i was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night it sounded great and much cheaper then the henckels of the world and look at all the different types of knives not worth it these knives don t cut well at all \( as compared to my henckel knife \) i wish i didn t buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives also the block holder is huge it takes up too much space,negative
this 2 qt bowl has many uses i use it for mixing serving and baking it is wonderful for macaroni and cheese also have done cobblers i have 6 different colors once you get one you will have to get another and another,positive
disappointing at best i was truly disappointed in this item after purchasing it we followed the directions for conditioning the non stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as before each use as listed in the use and care guide it sounds simple enough wait for the green indicator light to come on add the batter close but do not latch the lid the green light will go off when it comes back on the waffle is ready the only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue the waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts we said well ok maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it before they start to come out right 7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first the price is great the design is nice the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work at least not for us i told my wife i would take it back to the store and exchange it she said don t you dare bring another one of those things home with you it s to bad too we both love waffles,negative
i have to admit that i love this set especially since i found it hard to find white flannel sheets most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen so when i found these and at this price i was quite happy they feel great not the best flannel but nice all the same but after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore later the fitted started getting holes so since this was rather cheap i am not horribly sad about it so if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning this is the set for you,negative
i loved these sheets when i first got them they look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them after laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases i have laundered these in tide with no bleach what a shame they did not hold up well,negative
if you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed don t i have two areobeds i bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out the pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it fifteen years later it still works like a charm i liked it so much i recently bought a minute bed because i needed another guest bed it does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa the battery is nicad which means it develops a memory so now even if i remembered to charge it the day before it does not run long enough to inflate the bed they do not offer a separate electric detachable pump so now i m stuck with a plastic carpet that cannot be inflated with anything else the areobeds work great but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion buy a different type,negative
i bought this pan and to my suprise i had to assemble the handles on the skillet and the lid the handles on the skillet were not bad at all but the lid anyway after i got it assembled wash and dried per the instruction manual i plugged it in a began cooking it was amazing my chicken came out beautiful two days later i was cooking and the thing went out on me it became cool to the touch i left it alone for a while thinking maybe i did something wrong but i was already cooking at a low temperature it did not come back on when i replugged it in hence i had to give it back i was so disappointed i am just glad it did not happen while cooking the feast i had planned for the following week save your mone,negative
i have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than 30 a month after we purchased this water filter i can tell there s little difference between the water i buy at the store and the water from this filter i also feel confident if my daughters drink it because i know they re not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water i recommend this filter,positive

i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years and in general i have been happy with them but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used the product description does warn you that it s only heat resistant to 250 degrees but i was flipping eggs in a skillet which i consider a basic use for a spatula if it can t handle the heat of a hot skillet than i don t think it s a useful spatula not to mention that it s neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food,negative
this is our first juicer and we are have a great time juicing everything we use it a lot with our smoothie maker it is designed well and is very easy to clean it does drip a bit for a while from the spout but that isn t a problem at all we got this because we have a 2 year old and a 16 year old we wanted to make it easy to give them great tasting sweets that are good for them my 16 year old son loves apple juice and makes it all the time now no more soda in our house,positive
i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time however as other reviewers noted almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day i wasn t intending to use the delay feature very often so i didn t bother to return it now just short of a year after i received it it suddenly started working so i m shopping for a replacement i might try another mr coffee model with better reviews but not this one,negative
what people don t think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug i m not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it i have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross especially water who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face not me not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything it smells good and i can t imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some a great mug you should buy,positive

i should have paid more attention to the reviews i was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn t be used as an everyday or long term solution we ve been using the crate for less than three months and already the zipper one one end \( that we use all the time \) is screwed up and half the time it doesn t open at least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out but i m afraid of the morning when i try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck \( we leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in when she gets a little older we will leave her in her crate all day \) we could still use the zippers on the top but we don t like those since the dog can t get in and out at her leisure although in general it s a nice crate i probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers hence the two stars i am completely surprised that we only got three months use out of it before the zippers bit the dust we ve already purchased a different sturdier latch style crate that we re much happier with and we should have bought to start with,negative
appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and watch out for that hot plate burner it s a bit tough on the fingers if you weren t expecting the carafe to be heated basically this is a good coffeemaker just not quite worth the price tag for that amount of money i expected something more,positive
i use this desk chair frequently as a student i spend many hours sitting and studying at my desk the chair doesn t take up much space in my small apartment and it is comfortable and sturdy plus it was a great value so even if it doesn t last forever i am very happy for now,positive
do not buy this product it is not supplied with a parts list to order parts that may become broken if your call their customer service number everyone is very courteous however they want pictures of the power base \( front back top and bottom \) as well as a picture of the menu book they want all of this just to order a simple o ring gasket that goes on the the blender blade piece to act as a seal they will not sell you this item \( package of 4 for 7 95 \) without all of the above information as well as a receipt i find that all of this would be unessary if they would just supply a simple parts list dyanand,negative

searched for a long time to find a good quality espresso machine that didn t cost over 500 we had a great workhorse krups combo espresso coffee machine that was still working after 15 years was hoping this one would be the newer more powerful fancier model boy are we sorely disappointed the coffee part works fine unfortunately the espresso part leaks all over from the gasket and doesn t even produce hot espresso i exchanged this once hoping i just got a bad one but apparently the krups xp2010 is designed badly shame on krups for releasing a premature untested product,negative
i ve have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths they are also a nice large size so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they cannot be wrung out properly the colors of the towels are also beautiful i m buying more for our guest bathroom thank goodness i searched on amazon i don t believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else,positive

this set is so versatile i bought these because i own the red le creuset cookware and they matched them i thought that i would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard but the longer i own them the more uses i find for them great for appetizer containers for making mini casseroles \( or quiches \) creme brulee serving soup i ve even baked mini bread loaves in them the only recommendation i have is to buy two sets i usually end up using four at a time instead of two,positive
buy some rechargable batteries \( 4 aa s \) and you re set this fan has saved me time and time again at work when a hot flash hits just having some airflow around my face seems to help it s not a whirlwind but just enough,positive
i find it hard to give this even a 1 star given the price i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers here s why i am sorely disappointed 1 \) the stainless steel does in fact rust and corrode 2 \) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains no openings so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew 3 \) check your water softness because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly,negative

this is my first electric litter box i have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up it really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box it was a breeze to set up i also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats bathroom floor and with the tent they can t hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a bm on the floor i m going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down,positive

i rate this negative five stars i just purchased it thinking after reading all the reviews that it was great what a crock it s absolutely worthless it does not clean the water it s been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy the water flows and the motor is running the charcoal is in place but it doesn t clean the water i m better off with a bowl that i clean every day this thing just swishes around dirty water don t waste your money,negative
well after reading the reviews of this vacuum i decided to give it a try i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i didn t like i thought i d give it some time though and hoped i could adjust here is what i found 1 the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated 2 worse than the vacuum being heavy the darn thing is really hard to push even on hard smooth surfaces it s hard to push i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag for it to drag on hard surfaces it must be a design flaw 3 the on off power switch is foot operated not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i couldn t find it by looking down it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off unfortunately the damage was done the belt snapped how nice i really liked that first time out and the belt snapped another note about the switch there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it s a real challenge maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes hey dirt devil here is an idea how about putting the on off switch on the push handle what a novel idea doh 4 the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose the main reason being is that the hose it too short it s like you are fighting the hose all the time it gets tiring 5 the detachable hose is really hard to re install in it s port you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat 6 the vacuum is terrible on rugs on any of the floor height settings it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn t get all caught up i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it it jammed up every time 7 the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back i have to use the hose attachment 8 the vacuum is horrible on steps with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position easy deal the dirt devil does not work that way when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted one little problem with that the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking you don t get a good positive suction so you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position it often locks and so then you have to try and un lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth it s a joke the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops now for pros 1 the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up it almost makes my carpet look like new and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister some vacuums like to just tear up carpets 2 the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else i can t imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies maybe i ll be lucky and the motor will die soon then i ll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil steve,negative
i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is you won t bake a pie in it \( unless you make individual ones \) but it will be great for dips and sauces,positive
this is the best most beloved item in my kitchen i only wish i had bought the grinder and all the different cups \( which i am going to now add on \) i read some of the other reviews and at first i was also disappointed with this blender now that i have learned how to use it i love it do not put protein powder into it first it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup which you invert onto the blades \( when you invert it the bottom becomes the top \) if you put liquid in first and then the powder there s no problem you have to learn how to use it you will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick i read the reviews here before i bought mine and a woman said hers was junk but i went ahead and read the rest of the reviews and decided to buy it if mine breaks in a year it will have been well worth the price i use it every day and sometimes three times a day on a hot day when i want something slushy and cold i ll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice in a flash you have a refreshing drink it s fabulous i could use my cuisinart but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison there are no buttons to push you just fill the cup with your juice \( i often add protein powder \) and something frozen \( ice or frozen fruit \) and screw on the lid \( which have blades in it \) and put it on the blending base and twist you can either twist and pusle it or twist and leave it to blend on its own then you take the lid off rinse and that s it i love hummus and i will never make it in the blender because you have to dig it out and most of it gets left behind with this gadget you fill the cup blend it then screw off the blade lid screw on the refrigerator lid and that s it nothing to scrape just put it in the refrigerator \( oh yes you do have to rinse off the blade lid that s the whole clean up \) if you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend this is a great gadget i live in two places and i am getting another one for the other place but i m buying the complete set this time,positive
the humidifier started leaking after a few weeks in another website a few reviewers also had this problem the water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty very annoying the filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use it is also way too expensive,negative
i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz it does a reasonable job cleaning transforming my carpet from does she ever vacuum to oh she must have vacuumed yesterday it doesn t get all the fuzz and crumbs but it does what i d expect from a sweeper it is also much lighter than my vacuum so i m much more likely to use it my three year old daughter enjoys using it too she insists on sweeping her own room \( i won t complain \) the main thing i ve learned is that because the handle slides together it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle the sweeper will probably fall off so pick it up near the sweeper \( it stays together fine when actually sweeping,positive

my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker deliberately choosing one without a timer the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong right how can this company not even get the on off button right it s so cheap when you push it the lighted button just pushes right in and doesn t turn the coffeemaker off or on why didn t we keep the box and receipt so we could return it 20 down the drain don t buy this,negative
this vacuum cleans reasonably well but i have a few significant gripes which will prevent me from buying a similar model when making my next vacuum purchase which seems to about every 2 years i ve finally decided that we may go with an heirloom vacuum next time such as an oreck since the lifetime of any sub 100 vacuum is just ridiculous my complaints 1 this thing screams like a banshee it is indeed light and reasonably powerful but it literally hurts my ears to use it in small rooms it does not roar it emits a relatively high pitched scream i have had big small and medium size vacuums and this thing easily is louder than all of them i haev a 2 1 2 horsepower shop vac which is much quieter than this vacuum 2 wheels barely extend below the bottom of the vacuum so it requires a bit of effort to roll over anything but very short carpet wheeling from room to room say over hardwood while tipping the vacuum back also cannot really be done 3 the filter is hard to clean as it has a flange that extends down over maybe 1 3 of one side i often have to stick my finger in the space between the filter and the flange to get a significant amount of gunk out gross tell me how this is better than a bag,negative

being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons firstly there is no auto shut off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly secondly when using batteries they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries this light is also extremely fragile over a couple of years i went through 7 of these i would not recommend this light for the amount you spend on the never ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply and the constant new purchases after it breaks you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises \( available at barnes nobel come on and get it in stock amazon \) it is terrific it has a clock with an alarm and a timer you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes at that time you can extend the minutes if you don t do so for example you re sleeping it will automatically shut off it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light,negative

the scale does not come with a battery even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it all of this i can live with the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself when turned on it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds i timed it 40g for one minute \( and after hours just keep on going \) the box had no signs of damage so i m guessing the load cell was bad very disappointing,negative
ever since my curlers arrived i have been obsessed i love the curls i get from the larger size just roll your hair when you wake up do your make eat breakfast and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers \( very painless \) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials i love this product,positive

i read the reviews before i purchased this machine i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of so with this in mind i will put in my 2 cents i have had my machine for two months and i use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults a 4 year old and two dogs generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease the machine is set up to auto shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean freaks this machine doesn t quite hit the mark the water cleaning solution section is in my humble opinion to small i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up \) one more comment before i give my final review remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends there s a reason for this if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets so my final opinion is this if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it s a great time saver it s a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac up of dog hair scrub and mop any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment mop and bucket routine if you are a cleanfreak like me you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand and knees scrub no machine will ever leave you satisfied this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it s great i am giving this machine 4 stars because i think it does what it was designed to do light cleaning i would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i ll be all over it until then i ll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month,positive
i purchased four of these pillows i really shouldn t have wasted my money they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up i d rather sleep without a pillow at all,negative
as of today 3 24 i have not received this product very disappointed with delivery,negative
i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we ll have to live with the damage it s a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time,negative
lousy the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through i grate a lot of cheese and i am sorry i bought this grater,negative
a few times it worked great but mostly it brewed uneven i m not being a nitpicker here literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim there was no pattern to it sometimes it was the left one sometimes the right one sometimes neither filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging don t mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter it only took two days before i realized this was not worth the money or the time,negative
many times i ve come across great deals on amazon where i ve paid just little for a lot this is not one of those moments this pan feels like it s made from three layers of tin foil it s shockingly flimsy,negative
i bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores i hated having to shop around and wish i would have seen a set like this because i went from a queen bed to a king size i had to buy new pillows mattress pad comforter sheets etc i looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value plus much easier to buy all at once i highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress i was not able to buy the king size set but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift cheers ste,positive
i started to order replacement filters at 47 99 \( too expensive \) but found the whole machine was on sale for only 49 99 so i got 3 spare machines i ll be looking for one with a washable filter before those need replacement by the way they do remove dust and pollen and the like and i m happy with their performance,positive
this maker pours well and has a soft handle we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online nice little coffee make,positive
this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor the pur 2 stage dispenser specifically i found two main flaws 1 the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser as a result quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking even after tipping over the dispenser 2 even more infuriatingly the spigot s connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week i dutifully exchanged it for another one which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks it appears that the o ring that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator despite being a lifelong brita user i exchanged this product for a pur 2 stage dispenser i am now converted and will never go back the dispenser is rock solid and the water even tastes better,negative
these are a purchase to go with wamsutta sheets my daughter likes extra pillows these wash very well and are nice and heavy duty pillow cases are usually expensive for 2 99 at the closeout price i got a bargain,positive
i ordered this item because i know wusthof has a reputation for quality i find the kitchen shears sturdy and sharp especially appreciated are the easy separation feature of the blades for washing and the handy lid gripper for opening jars and bottles,positive
probably have bashed this product enough but it is insulting to still see sturdy lid and side handles for improved grip advertised in no time at all the handles broke off like peanut brittle glad i wasn t carrying it around the kitchen no wonder no one carries replacement handles don t know what s better but sure won t try rival again,negative
i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly at first but after only about 6 weeks of use the flip up spout broke off actually just broke in half i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good,positive
we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand \( they are made like hotel china essentially homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line \) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave they are both great never been disappointed with fiestaware,positive
i bought a haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months i called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one i have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing do not buy anything from this company their products are cheap chinese junk and they do not stand behind their products don t believe me look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and zero customer support,negative
i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon com and i absolutely love the rich cinnamon color of cinnabar the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal soup ice cream and leftovers \( smaller portions \) it s microwaveable too if you ve never used fiestaware before this would be a great introduction to the line especially if you have use for smaller soup cereal bowls,positive
i am totally dissatisfy with this product and this is damn waste of money brita base was working for just 2 week initially and now i able to get a water from filter but there is no light glowing either green or red the base was showing red flash light on end of first week for the first new filter which suppose to come upto atleast 2 months i recommed you all dont buy it,negative
this was very easy to put together and it holds a lot of coats great product at a great price,positive
whatever you do don t buy a shark it is a total waste of money it has to be the worst purchase that i have ever made you cannot contact the manufacturer smart move on their part their phone system would be overloaded with complaints,negative
usually break free product but smashed in amazon delivery and then had to wait 4 weeks for credit boo,negative
i bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture what a waste of my time and effort,negative
i expected better durability out of this fan it died after just 3 months and had flow problems from day one i tried contacting lasko but got no responses,negative
i am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the kitchenaid brand this blender is only one of several ka appliances i have purchased that only lasted about a year i don t use a blender much maybe once a month so when this died after only eleven months i was shocked kitchenaid was no help whatsoever my husband took it apart discovered that the motor still works but the on off switch went bad however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender after years of brand loyalty i am sad to say that i will not be buying anymore kitchenaid,negative
this item is not nine inches wide it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan but costs ten dollars more so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size hopefully the item description will be changed soon now i have to pack up and ship back several of these but at least amazon is paying the freight lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though i think this is just a random error just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7 99 the cornsticks will be the same size,negative
the lid drops in half the time you re trying to put it on the first six meals or so smell bad \( spoiled \) as they are cooking i think it s the sealing ring what a god awful smell for a kitchen,negative
it s pretty comfortable but what new mattress isn t the foam memory material takes a little getting used to i generally prefer a very firm mattress and had to get used to the sinking in feeling i ve also found you can t really use a lot of pillows what i like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns or gets out of bed you don t feel it the smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell but it isn t as obnoxious as it s made out to be but definitely present if ignored it will linger for about a month or so i didn t try to spray anything on it because it didn t really bother me that much over all it s a good mattress although not the greatest thing since sliced bread i m sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress and feel i ve definitely gotten my moneys worth i would recommend it,positive
product works well but i wish it moved greater volume of air runs 24 7 since oct 30,positive
sturdy well made spatula perfect for use in 12in to 16in woks for the price you just can t go wrong,positive
amazon is out of red after waiting for 2 months they shipped a white while the packing list states red when contacted they said that they do not have a red for replacement if i want a white i can get it elsewhere for 7 99 not i have to go through the trouble of returning it,negative
i read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway i was stupid i had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months that one is great and has held up after multiple washings it is still so soft so i just didn t belive the two bad reviews i was wrong the bad reviews are correct i took these new 9 out of the box yesterday they are not of the same quality of the one i already have they are packed at least 3 different ways i think maybe some of them are someone else s defective returns i don t think these are first quality there are many snags there is at least one blue stain one looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily the quality of the construction is not good some are soft some are rough i returned all 9 do not buy,negative
these sheets were the color size and quality described however if you tend to roll over instead of picking yourself up when you turn over while sleeping your sheets will very quickly begin to ball yes those tiny little balls you get on the clothes you wear within about 6 8 weeks the sheets have balls on the areas were the most friction happens they are otherwise great sheets but they don t act like egyptian cotton they are thick warm but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill \( soft twill mind you \) but they don t feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets i paid more money for pay for the real thing if you want soft non balling sheets,positive
i also have this fountian in black i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty the filters do not seem to last very long either i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one i do not reccommend this color at all the fountian has been fine until now but it shouldn t of broke down already,negative
of all my global knives i have bought recently this is my favorite i just love it it is very light and so easy to use and has so many uses and especially good for peeling vegetables one of my best buys,positive
i ve had this pot for over a year and love it fast hot great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time i bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because i loved the looks of it and there were limited choices at the brick and mortars i read all the reviews only after i bought it the reviewers major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking yes the plastic knob is poorly designed and is the only reason i give this pot 4 stars instead of 5 the designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob however it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot this is what i ve been doing since i bought the pot and i ve had absolutely no problems with the knob it s unlikely you ll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot so you can avoid burned fingertips a secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee i ve never had this problem i suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket or they are using the wrong grind it s important with any percolator to use a percolator grind or fac for all coffeemakers grind,positive
this is great it is very easy to clean just put it in the dishwasher you never have to worry about getting honey or syrup all over again it pours very clean and doesn t drip after you re done it looks very nice too great deal with a classy look,positive
this is a fine dehyrator it s quick and powerful the description says the trays are 13 5 inches but that text was lifted from the description for the fd 50 60 this model \( fd 1010 \) has 15 25 inch trays which adds almost one square foot to the area of the 13 5 inch tray multiply those larger trays by 30 \( the maximum capacity \) and you got a huge amount of drying surface,positive
i bought this oven recently it is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job all except the rotisserie when used grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full i was very dissapointed i contacted them via email today they say they will get with me in 24 hrs we ll see,negative
i used an avocado smaller than the tool so i had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it d fit then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell it made me realize that it s not that hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife oh well,negative
i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i couldn t use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that s all,negative
the stool fits under my kitchen table and is easy to move around i bought this stool for my 3 year old grandson he pulls it up to the sink when he wants to get a drink of water and he sits on it when he eats his lunch he loved mine so i bought him one of his own,positive
we love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff we love nothing more than our cast iron and lodge makes great ones at decent prices,positive
the slipcover barely covered my sofa will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside it keeps sliding off where i have to adjust it several times during the day if i could i would get my money back,negative
i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it s trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding,negative
great honing steel that is a bit longer than others i looked at \( seems to help a bit for the bigger knives \) and an attractive taper \( not sure that matters but it looks nice \) i ve only had it a brief time though i ve used it frequently despite an occasional clumsy collision this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks it straightens the edge on my \( mostly \) mid grade knives with ease another reviewer claimed the handle was plastic perhaps he was mistaken or perhaps he had a different version but mine purchased later has a visible grain if you look close under a dark ebony finish it does almost feel plastic due to the hard resin finish but it is the same material as on the shun knives a friend has \( though the steel lacks the metal endcap that her knives have \) aesthetics are open to debate but i think it looks much nicer than most and performs better than any other i ve used for daily straightening for less frequent light sharpening i recommend a diamond steel global makes the best diamond steel i ve seen but i ve stuck with the dmt for a quarter the price,positive
the step stool a gift for my daughter works well as a step stool the problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool the frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws there was a hole in the box and the screws fell out so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together,positive
aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the 4 setting it s pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it s warmed up \( keep it closed \) i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do sure they occasionally stick and i don t always get the batter in right and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it s on but this isn t a 100 device it s just a nice little waffle maker,positive
i went on a hunt for these glasses for a friend after our having beverages in them in a \( now gone \) bar in nyc i was delighted to finally find the exact glass at what i think is an affordable price for the quality i bought a set and we ended up splitting them \( he only wanted had space for 4 he lives in a small apartment \) i love them so much i ve now put them on my wishlist the beautiful clear glass clean design and impressive heft makes them feel elegant special and expensive i m certain the shape and feel make the single malt scotch i prefer taste even better an excellent value at less than 40 for six,positive
i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used \( and washed \) on a regular basis if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience give these a try,positive
evidently the people at krups didn t try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market the caraffe is hard to take out and put back in it scrapes the lid every time they say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer you need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee you never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups i m sure this is the last krup s product i will buy,negative
this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with i have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all it s so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors the only complaint i have is that the pads are hard to get on i have broke a few nails doing this it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this,positive
i have owned this type of product for years and it works very well this review is to warn others to think twice about ordering it from amazon they shipped the first one damaged then the replacement for the damaged one was much worse than the first one very frustrating and time wasting think about it its a plastic product that if not shipped packed properly is going to be damaged and will likely leak water i have ordered many things from amazon for many years and this is the worst result i have seen needless to say i am getting a refund and buying from another retailer,negative
this is not even a toy do not waste your money on this item amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a quick machine nothing about this machine functions well never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches amazon should not carry this item it has lowered the quality of amazon s products in my view,negative
i have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats and the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly,positive
in 1970 i was given a set of presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle at that time they didn t have non stick griddles through the years the handles broke but the grill fit over my stainless steel sink so no problem in 1999 i figured it was time to replace it with a new one i really loved it because it never stuck and once again i could rely on it in 2002 i started a pancake breakfast to raise money for our club it started with my presto grill and soon i added a second one over the next 18 months we raised 3 500 with those two grills serving pancakes french toast bacon etc my 3rd grill is still going strong and puts out our sunday breakfasts at home it is so refreshing to be able to depend upon the quality of an appliance these days thank you presto,positive
this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk,negative
i received these as a wedding gift not five of my tall glasses are broken and two short glasses none of which were from dropping them one broke as i was hand washing them and cut up my hand another literally broke as a guest was drinking out of it i was so embarrassed,negative
perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who don t like their food all running together on your plate good for snacks like pudding and jello also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing plus it won t take up alot of space on your table this is a very nice color,positive
i received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so i called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc i have since returned both pads in the same box,negative
just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us i should have taken more notice of the other reviews beautiful glasses but they are way too small my set will also be returned they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them,negative
my husband loves cereal for breakfast and i bought it so he doesn t have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal it was a perfect fit for him and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses i was surprised at how big it was but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful the rubber turn knob doesn t jam up as easily as i expected although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense only complaints 1 the top plastic covers are not completely airtight but are fine for dry cereal 2 the bottom rubber covers fall out easily they should fit more snugly,positive
like everything in the world this coffee maker is lawyer approved in other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee every day i have to warm my coffee up in the microwave,negative
i like the fact that it included diff sized containers and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot i have read reviews where people have burned out their motors and i will have to say that yes it s possible but only if you didn t follow the directions the manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient expect to shake things up once in a while between blends and this unit should last you at least a year d i think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it s thang gee if that was the case i d let my car drive me on auto pilot,positive
seriously for as good as their mixers are their knives are really really disappointing flimsy dull easily bent and broken within the first week of use our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later the steak knives are now following suit and the handle of the chef s knife has completely seperated from the blade gah don t waste your money,negative
one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i d much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there s no washing machine that s also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i didn t hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it s difficult to push and feels like it s gripping to the floor it doesn t fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it s big fat part vacuum head and when you re finished it s a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you re supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you ve finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i don t review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i m hoping that they will one day,negative
the fact that you don t have to rotate the trays like some other dehydrators is great we have made a lot of beef jerky since buying the snackmaster express it is a great product works great,positive
i have watched emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter i just dismissed it as part of emeril s shtick until i bought this machine for myself the first time i tried to use it with any liquid ingredients \( making mayonnaise \) it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl the top is just flawed in its design as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl i suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that ka did much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews \( e g consumer reports and cook s illustrated \) in any case this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry \( they blow through the badly designed joint as well \) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter the outside of the bowl the bottom of the machine and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do i will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the cuisinart i have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard,negative
great product at a great price the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item thank you,positive
i have had this product for 8 yrs before the internet i make a meal for my husband family every nite could hardly live without this product it really eliminates the need to wash dry measuring spoons and takes all the hassle out of making dishes with many ingredients at least you don t have to get a utensil out for measuring spices i have had this product in 3 homes \( i m a military spouse \) and it has been able to mount under the cabinets in 2 houses thus saving me valuable counterspace cabinet space due to the small kitchens in military housing i would highly reccommend this to those who like to cook in tight spaces every move i just empty the spices run the canister thru the dishwasher then set out to dry of course the labels had started to come off after 7 years so i simply printed out some new cutesy labels for those spices i constantly measure as i remember the labels that came with the package included most every spice you could ever want money well spent 8 yrs ago my hubby bought this for me it has survived a lot of cooking and moves,positive
this product is ok it s just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum the head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint catching fabric the extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast but for what it is this attachment is ridiculously overpriced,negative
this was my first calaphalon purchase and i am so impressed that i plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future this pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1 2 qt pans the unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food hand washing the pan is easy i love this pan,positive

very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room our dog a rescued border collie is incontinent so she cannot roam around the house and while she prefers being outdoors with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside in the same room as her family \( instead of out back in the mud room where her old wire cage was \),positive
this is the worst pan i have ever had we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap 1st the silicone smell was horrible 2nd the pan warped in oven i used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th the muffins did not come out i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck i will never buy silicone anything don t waiste your money,negative
i purchased this bonjour frother to replace my old aerolatte frother the difference between the two brands is startling the bonjour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually over froths the milk this causes the bubbles to keep breaking down i can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won t last long on the othe hand the aerolatte frothers \( also widely available with several models on amazon \) uses more of an open metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create i m buying another aerolatte and will use the bonjour wand for things that don t need thick foam \( like mixing salad dressing \),negative
who needs the high tech stuff this little frother couldn t be better it works killer within seconds it even works on my soymilk i m so impressed,positive

the written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5 yr old vornado models that are the best electric heaters i ve ever had the vh2 has major flaws it s single fan speed is way too fast causing heated air to be cool cold within 10 ft of the heater the fan cannot be slowed down the thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals thereby wasting energy i believe finally the thermostat is set so that when at the highest \( hottest \) setting it doesn t allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees f i ve had the heater 1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as i have an alternative brand in my home,negative

i have the black fusion in my home office \( which is next to a basement level theater room \) and my wife and i already love this machine we have tried all sorts of mixes and we ve only scratched the surface of what this machine can do this is one of the first times i ve been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it physical properties it handles travel mugs \( if you remove the drip tray which is largely unneeded anyway \) and all our standard mugs the drink head moves up and down so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks \( more common with frothy drinks than coffee and tea \) when it brews a filterpack it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out \( and thus keep it from dripping as you remove it \) the water tank could be larger \( if only because we re so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long \) but if you have a ready source of water nearby it shouldn t be a problem the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo \( which we also have \) flavor wise it s made by m m mars so you can bet that the sweeter drinks \( the so called indulgence fare \) is excellent coffee blends are quite good especially the darker roasts like french roast and sumatra lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks moreso than other chains clean up wipe the inside of the drink head and possibly the front of the plastic column \( the colored portion \) after any particularly splashy drinks no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug of course you can t watch its magic when the drink head is that low so your first few times you ll probably get a drip here and there final bits we ve had the senseo since its launch between pods that need pre wetting to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not so great varieties of drinks the senseo is lagging behind the flavia we drink coffee tea espresso drinks mixed blends and sweet tooth friendly indulgence mixes every day with the flavia and it s brain dead easy to use certainly easier to clean up after too if you re on the fence between the flavia and other single cup offerings \( like senseo \) get the flavia keurig and other single cup offerings can t touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia i m sipping a lemon blueberry tea blend now made over ice and it s fantastic highly recommended,positive
using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing and it requires a finer ground than what auto drip machines ask for after the water is brought to a boil it s important to wait for it to cool just slightly \( about 30 seconds \) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter wait for them to drain and then fill the pot with water want more than a single cup of coffee you wait for your first pour to brew and then fill the filter again some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing 1 taste i don t know how it does it but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter 2 cleanability users can keep all necessary components clean \( anyone who s brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn t there when you bought it understands this plight \) oftentimes the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it s not possible to get your hand into the reservoir some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot but if you re like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass then you need some good ol fashion friction to get it clean the best thing i ve found a baby bottle cleaner it s narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls too brilliant 3 electricity free as long as you can boil water you can have coffee 4 mud sludge french press and stove top espresso style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee don t get me wrong i think that s good \( i use a french press when i m in the mood \) but the cone on a chemex doesn t allow that at all 5 style size the chemex coffee pot is a relic \( designed in the 40s \) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it s a wonderful minimalist sight on any kitchen counter \( and unlike electric coffee makers easy to move if you need the space \) some drawbacks any purchaser should consider 1 time it does take 5 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee 2 cones you can t run over to wal mart when you use the last filter you need to find a specialty store or go online which means you need to plan ahead 3 cold coffee no electric hot plate \( thank god \) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop i think that s more labor added to an already laborious endeavor just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee 4 learning curve it does take some time to get the grind right the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue 5 cleanability i know this is in the advantages column as well but it s worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff \( which is a small pain \) else it will get nasty over time,positive
this is essentially the all clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles the dutch oven sold by all clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1 2 quart saucier this is a versatile stovetop pan wide enough for frying deep enough for liquids good looking enough to carry to the table it can also slide into the oven when needed it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans as one poster complained but it functions quite well as an everyday pan for up to 4 persons the dimensions of 9 1 2 inches by 3 inches \( plus handles \) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape with a rounded bottom for easy stirring if you are looking for a versatile do it all pan this is a good choice,positive

i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel let s be realistic these knives are cheap they re thin and they re not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that s what you re getting i hand washed these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and didn t hear back i finally got their address \( from the post office \) and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them \( with 15 minute wait times for each call \) to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i m going to finish my sentence so their rep would stop talking they won t refund my money in fact they won t refund anyone s money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they ll send me another set of soon to be rusty knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can,negative

this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces however once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware you ll want to buy more over the years i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well known commercial cookware brand but all clad is far superior the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well balanced making them very easy to handle they heat evenly and cook uniformly even over low and medium heat i am very pleased with all clad s performance on my radiant cooktop i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance well worth every penny,positive
about a year ago i was looking for an espresso cappuccino machine that would be both great in quality and easy to use i also wanted it to look contemporary to fit the style of other things in the house on the other hand i didn t want to spend a fortune for some expensive brands that run up to 12 000 at that moment i was lucky enough to order from amazon breville 800jexl juice fountain elite that juicer impressed me so much that i was happy to buy breville s whatever which happened to be breville 800esxl die cast espresso machine it is reasonably priced for style and quality and so far i my husband and all our guests are happy with both espresso and cappuccino i only wish i could do more than 2 cups at the same time a year later i still think it was a great buy and it works as well as ever,positive

it makes the cleanest and purest coffee i have ever tasted i also use a moka pot a french press and a drip and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot to those who had failures and could not get it apart i have no idea what you are doing wrong there is little to go wrong fill the lower pot put on the upper pot with grinds in it heat it watch the water infuse the grinds remove from heat and let it go back down what is there to go wrong if it fails to go back to the lower pot there must have been a vacuum leak pull it apart and let gravity do it or just stick something in it and dislodge the filter if you are in a hurry there is no vacuum up top so how the coffee got stuck up there defeats all i know about physics just dump the stuff into the sink if it fails to go back through the filter it is pretty simple if it doesn t work for you i d call it user error try again if you can boil water this should pose no problem i have used it 100s of times with not one failure,positive
first off this machine looks great but unfortunately that s where the attraction ends you see i too used a little krups 45 espresso machine for years but it was a heck of a lot easier to use and made consistently better espresso cappucinno than this dog here s a brief synopsis the reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days i m constantly refilling it after making an espresso the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end making a mess of the whole machine the steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam the lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion and positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome did i mention the thing leaks now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino it doesn t,negative

why oh why did i buy this useless thing i have a perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13 inch screen which does what it is supposed to do namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners walls and floor is it perfect no but it definitely does most of the job which is what i can t say about the tovolo it has three fatal flaws first the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off i had to use one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid hot hot hot as i tried to wedge the handle under the screen s lip with my other hand second count the number of air holes in the silicone screen then count the holes in the metal mesh of the cuisipro or its ilk the purpose of a screen is to catch the grease and this is the important part to allow the steam to escape otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food i first tried using the tovolo to saute ground beef the beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen third too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat in all fairness the mesh type bows also but not as much possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable this product imo is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version save your money and buy the old fashioned kind,negative
ok this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds not minutes also it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil really its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge stupid stupid stupid design the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together its like a rubics cube a true waste of 40 bucks don t buy this it doesn t even look very cool,negative
the original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms this replacement filter however does not seem to wick water very well it can barely keep a 17x12 room at 30 humidity with the door closed windows shut and heat turned off and it s in the 40s not even very cold out in fact it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank i have to flip the filter every hour or so i called hamilton beach but they said it wasn t their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3m of course this is the only filter offered for use with this unit,negative
i love this little coffee maker i have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but i have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum this maker is made from stainless steel which is more expensive but for me it s worth it \( as it will probably last a lifetime \) it makes a very good cup of coffee and i m very happy with it also the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent,positive

i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife she loves it our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or for that matter on the box it arrived in the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me the knives are well crafted have a great feel extremely sharp and we love them there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other we also love the selection of knives especially the paring knife and small serrated knife some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we ve not noticed either of these conditions,positive

i ve had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest replaced it with a 20 mr coffee 4 cup from walmart which eventually let water out the front the back the side etc creating a puddle just like the leaky braun threw that out and went to a 12 cup hamilton beach that i had received as a gift what a pos it had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also the crap leaked as well and when i lifted it water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor after reading reviews on the net and countless hours of searching for a good price i was ready to buy the bunn stainless steel i almost bought the bodum electric santos until i read that for some users the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature anyway while at target i spent an hour looking at coffee makers including the bunn which i really liked b c it is made in the usa i decided to buy this one just to test it out i like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning \( which the bunn does not ahve \) and a timer which also the bunn does not have the carafe is not bulky and has a no drip mouth also i have not seen any leaks so far but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter perhaps i should just remove the filter and not the basket the problem with most coffee makers is the steam after it condenses the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body anyway i also like the cool blue light in the front and the coffee takes good or as good as my braun which is what i ve been used overall i don t think it s bad for 40 bucks if it develops a leak i ll go buy the bunn if that also sucks i think i ll give up coffee for i ve had enough trying to find a good easy no drip leak \( no punn intended \) drip coffee maker,positive

i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it i d looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior i broke a lot of rules setting this up its not connected to the hot water supply since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines also the machine is on the floor under the sink i bought new hoses to make the connections luckily the standard connectors on the back made this easy the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line and the drain can take a piece of garden hose i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water but so far its been okay \( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home i might not be so nonchalant \) my unit was used from an area where there was very hard water and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill the heating element and the wash arm and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal and away we went since we are in an office we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over if you pop the door open the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise if you load this machine carefully you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much and the machine will operate more quietly we ve found that we can run the machine have the office radio on and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble my only complaints would be that on occasion the timer has gotten stuck \( once or twice in 100 washes \) also some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater capacity is very decent probably because the machine is pretty large measure first,positive

after the handle broke off the carafe that came with our krups aromacontrol \( after about 2 years of use perhaps several times a week \) i found this one and ordered it my belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off however i am perturbed that i had to go to the trouble of replacing it one would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components i am not entirely sure but it is possible that the plastic \( abs \) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured i searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem which is at the same time comforting and annoying upon receiving this carafe i was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it i prefer a certain heft and i assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made however this has proved not to be the case moreover the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing further i think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe \( inside \) on this model the advantage of this is that the coffee pours better \( a tighter stream not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe \) however i it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult in all it is superior to the original however i am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off i assume that they have fixed this problem in this model however i cannot be sure of this i also must say that it is a tad over priced and that perhaps might be a more reasonable price the only reason i did not get a new coffee maker is that the aromacontrol works well and makes good coffee \( i use illy \),positive

what a failure seemed just right for a simple way to make a quick single brewed cup of coffee small low profile and uses little space on the counter the science is so simple and established that i figured there could be no problems wrong it cannot deliver more than 6 ounces of water through the system even though the water well holds 12 ounces if you drink more than six ounces \( smaller than a juice glass \) of coffee this is not the unit for you the well is filled with 12 ounces and the machine starts to brew good then about half way through the process \( very slow \) it simply stops i used my own 12oz mug which fits well but the pot seems pooped and just keeps on heating the water without delivering it through the plumbing i have plunged the small water hole in the bottom if the well with no results i ve tried it five times wasting coffee and time and it simply doesn t want to work i m planning to use it for a planter small cut wildflowers will look nice for coffee i m going to a real working product it doesn t pay to return this item because the time and postage will make it too expensive this is junk pure and simple,negative

took the pan home and promptly fried a steak on high thereby causing an apartment full of smoke and a pile of burnt crud on the pan including a large stain seemingly impossible to get off tried everything including the company s recommended bleach method no luck then i tried baking soda as suggested in one of the reviews here and it just simply wiped away the damage like new then i set about reading the instruction booklet and have had great results using low heat it s really a different way of cooking but the fried stuff comes out just as if i d used high heat on another pan stainless steel s great too of course but this is a worthy and earthy alternative i take the perspective that the ceramic layer gives the pan a solid foundation for the seasoning process,positive

this machine replaces a semiautomatic delonghi which i thought was decent well after using this for 3 weeks i can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent the titanium is a wonderful machine not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great it s fully programable and once set it s just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso every time it warms up in under a minute has a large bean hopper large water resevior very cool blue lcd display i can t rave enough i ve had no problems at all with this machine and i recommend it heartily,positive
i gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months even cut through chicken bones but just like the other reviews the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment i used these for making chicken soup alot but noticed that it also doesn t always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken i like to be extra careful so the next set i get i ll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from henckels this time,negative

i purchased two units one for our home and one for our vacation home within a few days the unit at home was no longer making good crema the water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses i m sending both units back and buying another brand if they had worked properly i m not sure i would have like them even then the design of this unit is odd i ve had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird if you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew the grounds and steam explode all over i also suspect that the thermostat is broken it allows the water to boil which does not make tasty coffee overall i hate this unit i m going back to shopping,negative
first of all the item is too small it is about 1 3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1 3 as wide so as you can see it is pretty small so it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again it does not make life easier good in principle but does not work,negative

i purchased this for a betta fish which was a gift for my cats this model was perfect because the lid screws on which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish there is a small hole at the top so you don t have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish the aqua gems cover the bottom but i added some gravel for additional covering also the aqua gems are light and you lose some when changing the water so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually the one negative i found is that the light is basically useless it illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly other than that i m very satisfied i did look at petsmart for additional oxygen stones but they don t sell them not sure if those are really necessary though,positive
wouldn t you think that the manufacturers of a wine rack would measure the bottles of wine before designing the rack apparently not in this case after purchasing 3 of these racks i discovered that about 10 of my 200 bottle collection doesn t fit in the grid holes it was understood that magnums weren t going to fit which was no big deal but when over 20 bottles end up sitting on the floor because they are about 1 8 to 1 4 too large in diameter i get a little irritated especially after paying over 300 including shipping the overall quality of the product is average the racks were not straight along their length and had to be tie wired together to keep them in alignment,negative

there s nothing worse than having to find space for and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop and because she s on the countertop you will use her she works great will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling i tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me she poaches four eggs perfectly and here you can use jumbos if you like the water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done adding more or less water the next time will take care of that actually the first time i poached jumbos i found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste i added a bit more water to the cooker plugged her back in and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute when the water evaporates she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing \( as i am \) i love this cooker first one i have ever owned and because she looks cute sitting on the counter i don t forget i have her therefore she gets used alot,positive

i really enjoy cooking in this pot it has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes the enamel surface is wonderful i love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family the only drawback is how heavy the pot is but that doesn t change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen,positive
this far exceeds any similar bowl so what if the other reviewer has to flip this thing 3 times to get his her heep of sugar personally i replaced my sugar bowl spoon server so that my children would not over do it on the sugar in their morning cereal the product feels and looks great and functions well i ended up buying another one for my work location it is super easy to clean and the fact that it is of simple design makes after use clean up a snap,positive
i had this blender for 3 4 years and was very unhappy with it the design is poor \( liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured \) the motor seems weak and it is hard to clean food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable today after only sporadic medium duty use over the few years i had it my blender outright died i have other cuisinart products that perform very well but this blender is a loser,negative

my daughter needed this item for an event and the wrong item was delivered by then we were under a time crunch so i talked to customer service but there was no way target would expedite shipping the correct item to arrive in time i had to order the item from another supplier and pay for 2 day delivery in the meantime the online pathway for getting a shipping label to return the wrong item lets me spend time putting all the information in but then shuttles me to a try again screen i try half a dozen or more times and give up an hour later i try again with the same dead end i email customer service to just send a label by email but have yet to receive a response the next day i try again with the same dead end i have wasted a lot of time for something i don t even want i think i will let my credit card company know to not pay and let the supplier ship me a return label when they get around to it can you tell i am not impressed with the service,negative
i was originally going to buy clickclack \( made in new zealand \) storage containers to save money i bought these \( china made \) containers instead and it was a big mistake the first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers the soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed the clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks the final straw came when i dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off rendering the container useless for airtight storage and that s assuming that the somewhat loose fitting lids actually make the containers airtight if you want containers like these spend the money on clickclack or some other quality brand i m surprised target sells these at all,negative
after using my roomba for a year and loving it i decided to splurge and buy scooba wow i think i love it even more than my roomba i turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it when i return i have a gorgeous shiny clean smelling floor once a week i wrap a damp washcloth around my swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny all the time scooba is a miracle i did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box i had to prime the pump to get it going my only suggestion to irobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming scooba in the box instead of making people go to the irobot website to troubleshoot obviously from reading the reviews you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem fortunately that s the only trouble i ve ever had with it i ve never had to prime again and it works flawlessly i m very impressed with scooba,positive
i wanted a dual coffee espresso maker thinking i would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence but i was totally surprised how easy it is to use and now it s lattes every day also there was almost no learning curve my first cup \( surprisingly from what i ve read elsewhere \) was near perfect and apparently it wasn t a fluke if there is any drawback it s only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe \( but i m sure a purist would scoff at such a notion \) if i have one recommendation it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe \( or whatever it s called \) to steam your milk i m not a physicist so i m not sure why but it does make a difference in summation this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice \( i give it 4 stars instead of 5 because i have to grind the beans and it didn t include an intravenous unit \),positive
the detector was simple enough to use although it required alot of batteries \( 8 \) but the results were mixed urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances even in areas where i knew there had been an accident it was difficult to spot the difference all in all i generally wouldn t recommend this \( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom \),negative

it doesn t zap the yap of our newly adopted pomeranian mix although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it but it didn t slow her down much we did everything according to directions and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact we have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well i m disappointed with this bark collar though,negative
i bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs it works for a while then stops working or just goes on warm they replaced it three times everytime it went out this seems to be common with cheap rice cookers see the reviews on the rival rcs 200 they all go out within days or weeks i guess black and decker and rival used the same chinaman to design these useless things i can t understand why amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do not work the companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately in frustration i bought the aroma 60 cupper for 125 and after two months that also went out any suggestions on a 20 cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated,negative

we bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months i thought if i upgraded a bit i could get a bit more milege out of it like maybe 2 years but now with only 5 months of usage suddenly no power totally dead it is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center aren t too outrageous we ll try that route other wise looks like another waste of money i have to say that while it did work we enjoyed it it was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven and made great bacon in the warmer a bonus we weren t expecting update to this review i sent in to warranty center and they replaced it with a new one it took a while and then they sent the wrong item \( same name different product honest mistake \) but were very very nice when i called and sent the right one out right away now just hoping this one lasts more than 5 months,negative
okay i haven t used this while reading in bed yet but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting it s great the light isn t good for areas that are adequately well lit so don t bother to use the light there but in areas where light is dim the light shines literally it casts a bright light on the page \( s \) that you need to view it s helped me tremendously get through pages of reading yes it s a bit pricey for what you get but it s incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go the power adapter however is a cumbersome brick as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for i can t offer an estimate of time yet but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so cumulative not consecutive hours so no complaints yet about that whenever i saw this light online or in the store i used to think why in the world would i ever want something like this now my thoughts are why didn t i ever think to buy this before,positive
i baked six loaves in this machine i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don t turn out just right my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time \( 70 minutes \) my loaves were only marginally acceptable they were not sufficiently baked i was using a nearly whole wheat recipe the machine was quiet strong and had a lot of bells and whistles but with only partially baked bread i had to return it to amazon amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back and were quick enough with the refund,negative

i purchased a krups thermal replacement pot for an electric coffee maker about two weeks after i bought it i made coffee one morning only to discover the coffee running all over the floor for no apparent reason the glass inside of the thermal pot had completely shattered i will be returning the pot this week,negative
i bought this coffee maker with great faith in the krups name willing to order online without the touch factor i was sorely disappointed while the concept seems promising the actual product is a failure the carafe is awkward and you have to fiddle with it every time to pour your coffee and the handle simply came off after just 6 months of normal use \( a m coffee only \) and there is no way to fix it as the bolts are lodged inside and can t be accessed an expensive mistake and to think i d looked to krups to solve my problem of having to replace coffee makers every six months or so don t waste your money and i personally will avoid the krups brand from now on,negative
i returned eureka 437az back to amazon i was very dissapointed when i ve tried to vacuum my room the vacuum is powerful but flow of air comming from the front blower is so strong that it disperses dust all over and prevents proper vacuuming in the cosumers report eureka 431 green vacuum cleaner is not recommended model and now i know that these two vacuums are practically identical the only difference being color and hepa filter another downside of this vacuum is that the dust acumulates over the filter which then is difficult to clean,negative

for quite a while i had been looking for a certain type of dvd rack tower then one day in target i was looking at the mission collection and saw the box \( no display \) it is exactly what i had been looking for slapped on the two foot ends and done perfect fit for dvds 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy dvd cases like the ones new line cinema puts out you can fit more i don t have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one dvd per slot i have many oversized ones the hardwood is great too just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall if you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then it is worth it i am almost ready to buy a third one soon,positive
when i first saw this dehumidifier i couldn t stop laughing this little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed i figured that something was better than nothing until i could buy a better \( bigger \) dehumidifier i hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little bitty sucked up an inch of water in one night now i am so confident that this will do the job i will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem the free shipping was a great plus as well,positive
we had a press made by singer that finally gave up the ghost after more than 10 years after a several days of ironing clothes with mixed results a lot of frustration we researched presses on amazon based on customer reviews we decided on this press and have not been disappointed the press is ready to use as soon as it s out of the box operation is simple all but self explanatory and it heats up very quickly it is a little smaller than our previous press but not so small as to be a drawback clothes are ready in no time compared to ironing the press comes with a water spray bottle if you prefer not to use the steam feature definitely worth the money spent,positive

this vacuum worked the first time i used it but that was the only time with the amount of noise it makes you would hope that it would be removing dirt from the floor however what it appears to be doing is using its rotating bristles to redistribute the dirt in a thinner more homogenous layer if you are looking for a machine to use as a sound effect prop for a jet engine this is the one for you,negative
i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews but it isn t so hot the light isn t very bright and quite diffused and the light sensor isn t sensitive enough it stays on in all but the brightest light i ordered two but have only opened one and the other is likely to stay in its packaging,negative
this swissmar fondue set is excellent i love how stylish it is i looked on amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do cheeses broths for meat chocolate flexibility is what i was looking for the 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with when done with that course remove the ceramic bowl pour the water out of the copper pot and put in your broth although i haven t used it for chocolate yet i m sure it will work well for that using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir of course if you re into the tradition of swiss fondue cooking the thick part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest the burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another i have used also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course you will need to refill it between cheese and broth of course make sure it s extinguished and cool before doing so i used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store an excellent purchase i am very happy with it,positive

my wife and i have used this machine for several weeks now we found it to be a great machine for the price others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands so i immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other american vacuums now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on this thing is lite strong and easy to empty the cord retractor is a little lite so i wouldn t be to rough with it garrett and susan,negative

this lamp went together with no problem the pieces fit tightly and the lamp stands perfectly upright it is more brownish than reddish but i believe that it can go with many colors especially pastels the design color and simplicity make this a very classy lamp the slate shade is gorgeous and much tougher than i thought this lamp as most lamps is not made for grabbing and moving too much put it where you want it and enjoy it s beauty buying this lamp is a win win situation,positive

i personally haven t heard a peep about silverstone in ages and frankly when i bought this item i didn t even realize it was made by them i needed new muffin pans so i just looked for the best deal price wise i saw this set and figured it was as good as any when i received them i was ecstatic when you think of something relatively trivial like this you don t really expect much in the way of quality but man was i wrong these things are weighty very well constructed and have durable written all over them i consider it a huge upgrade from my old flimsy no name tins and i highly recommend them for anyone who like me bakes a lot and really just doesn t want to worry about replacing these kinds of things too often,positive
i just want to say i am not sure why the person who lost a piece of the product in her \( dawn ulepich dawnski337 \( illinois \) \) haste is criticizing the company for a bad product i have only had one problem ever with a rival product and when i called the company they immediately sent a new product out to take care of the problem even though it was not a product problem but rather a handling problem i have found that they are a more than fair company and will take care of their customers they probably would have even taken care of replacement of the plastic part \( even though she lost it \) it is not fair to penalize the store from which it was bought or the company that produced it because of her carelessness,positive
i liked the price and all the different stitches however i needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things such as alterations and heavy sewing i m very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine the needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread also the food feed stalls jerks and surges this machine has beautiful stitches but is for lightweight sewing only,negative

i am a very experienced user of innova innova is i guess you can say is the parent company of ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware innova is not know for quality and this product is no different there is a 25 year warranty on the ultrex i had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off you can return the product for another but yes you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized you have to pay ups or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge the customer service is not world class i had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement the workmanship is horrible the product is made in china however i ve had other things made in china that were of great quality so i don t know what is up with innova i suggest that if you find a product made by innova avoid it save yourself the aggrevation this product doesn t deserve 1 star,negative

in the twentieth century and before cast iron pans had the size stamped on them which told you the diameter of the cooking surface twenty five years ago i bought the lodge 10sk which is a 12 skillet with a 10 inside cooking diameter ok with this skillet marked 14sk the inside cooking surface is only 12 and it should be marked 12sk they deceptively flared out the sides to get an overall top diameter of 15 1 4 as a selling point this isn t very helpful to my pork chops being 36 less space than i thought i was buying i d watch out for the 10sk too i guess to get a real 14 cast iron skillet i need to get a griswold hilditch ps it weighs 10 lbs,negative

i bought this canister vacuum about 2 months ago and i absolutely love it it is quiet and i told my husband i swear it picks up the dirt off the basement floor from our living room i love the automatic rewind cord the cord is very long and i don t have to look for a plug in each room i vacuum i have all hardwood floors and two cats and it really keeps the hair volume in the bag the wands are sturdy metal i have gone through about 3 vacuums in the past two years due to plastic parts breaking thank you electrolux for the quality build of this vacuum the only thing that irritates me is i can not keep the attachments attached to the bend in the wand i finally gave up and put them in a drawer since i seldom have to use them spring and fall cleaning will be the only time more than likely i also wish the vacuum wands would stand by themselves when i have to leave the vacuum for one reason or another but it is still a 5 star even considering those two little things,positive
i got this to replace my bulky turner that i got from the dollar store for 1 00 for an extra 3 or so i got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me also the turner part looks plastic but i guess it s silicone or something because it does not melt also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat if washing by hand its easily washable too i have both the blue and green flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen,positive
one shouldn t have to empty water out after every use one shouldn t be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice that is not a functional teapot if that may be the case though it is the prettiest teapot around it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime but the enamelware can t even touch the quality of the cast iron cookware fortunately the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement see www lecreuset com for details,negative

the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know that i would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop when using the wet mop it will leave water lines where i stop therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels when using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks i have not recommended this product to anyone a waste of 100 00,negative
i ve had my vacuum for a few years now only b c i m too lazy to buy another one however i am at the end of my rope from day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently and most of the time i was vacuuming on hardwood if i accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb the belt broke i took to buying lots of extra belts whenever i went to the store the other day surprise the belt broke for no apparent reason i promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute i turned the vacuum on i say no more i am now determined to buy the best vacuum ever i don t care how much it costs the only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose attachments without having to flip a switch and it is pretty powerful but that s it changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers i frequently run over the cord something just wasn t designed right there you ve been warned,negative

christmas morning and the slow ongoing leak which we worked around over the last year finally gave way and voila hot coffee and water and grounds all over the counter and floors and yes we clean our coffeemaker daily and yes we know how to properly run the thing too \( we gave up on the water filter soon after purchase it kept falling into the coffee grounds \) why the two stars we wanted to love this machine we wanted it to work it is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree \( a mr coffee \) the clock is nice the thermal carafe is lovely until the big leak we made do with its daily dribble and sputter but really after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did that s why i ve bothered to write this review it is not an inexpensive machine the quality isn t there sorry,negative

the concept was great but after only a month or so flaws started showing the inserts started bending and warping seperating at the edges and cracking i purchased them for my mother who gave them to my daughter as a gift she loved the idea but will go back to the wooden boards because i don t think these will be around long and they were not cheap either,negative
i got this for our 3 year old daughter s room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night i wouldn t rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room the top and back do get hot although you d have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned bumping into it should not cause any burns i haven t noticed any odors or noises from it,positive

look i suck at using a normal iron but after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on dry cleaners the results are pretty good as i have gotten better using it the results have gotten better plus there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others i just did a couple of long sleeve dress shirts and the results were good not perfect but good as others have said i wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with but once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge isn t really a big deal more height clearance would be nice though it won t be too long before it pays for itself and now i have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled plus i m pressing my golf shirts which typically didn t look that good after being washed but were too expensive to get dry cleaned i also just ironed an undershirt just for fun now that was an easy shirt to iron,positive

to us typical fiestaware pieces have great design color durability and functioning wrapped up all in one we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with straight candle results even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product specifically the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform a kind of softer look in the color application around the rims on plates for example and the piece will still look beautiful we don t want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces,negative

do not be tricked into buying an easy sharpener they do not work spend the same money \( or less \) on a good stone set that has various angles \( i e lansky w 17 20 25 and 30 degree angles and 3 5 stones use 20 degrees for your slicing and paring knives and 25 degrees for you chefs \) i opted for the stone set \( i m a bit of a purist \) but i ve heard good remarks about the diamond set too the 3 grit set is all you really need coarse medium and fine get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such with proper care and light steel use \( it s the re aligning tool not the sharpening device be gentle \) you ll probably only need to touch up your edge once every year or two depending on the work load you put on your knife but if you do seriously muck the edge up you ll have a system that can repair your knife to good as new condition my chef fell onto the tile floor point first and i had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later the normal touch up takes less than 5 minutes per blade and at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened you ll be ahead of the game after the first use hint use a 5x magnifying glass loupe to inspect your edge by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source you ll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened you can also take a look at your edge before using the steel and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel and see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives i admit i have a couple myself in short get stoned not taken,negative
i bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers i did not succeed i paid 50 and could have bought a 20 mr coffee and saved myself a lot of my money this is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features it has no clock no timer no automatic turnoff \( it will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off it is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back it is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles you are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing in a word don t it just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element and it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee i am not an engineer just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go this coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace if you want a basic coffeemaker get a mr coffee for 20 this is not what you are looking for there is nothing deluxe about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me,negative

the story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with mitchum in one of his nastiest roles it s almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in cape fear he meets his match in lillian gish s character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is sweet in fact the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film charles laughton in his only stint at directing does an excellent job but i think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension a very good example of film noir,positive
in this film made in uk and luxembourg madeline stowe stars as senga senga and her daughter nat are driving at midnight after visiting nat s father they bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult and we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood why they do so is never explained and even at this point when senga is trying to rescue nat she still acts like a brat the last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion and becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating i assigned that good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction not the wirtting the movie is dark and suspenseful though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie it does keep you on the edge of the seat as senga tries to rescue her daughter,negative

i have read many reviews stating that this remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968 granted that version is marvelous i have bought both versions and love them both ok it is difficult not to compare when watching but i can t help wondering if this version would have been the first i or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version if people would have been complaining about that version i can have different versions of vivaldi s four seasons can t i actually for those among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them all \( and i do understand that people can have preferences for one or the other \) we would never say this or that piece is a remake of that version would we i have gone to the opera numerous times and watched don giovanni three times every time with different performers remake absolutely not i think that the only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is the wish to make it because is such a great play so logically this would not be a remake why can t we watch this version for what it is and let go of the other \( splendid 1968 \) version when doing so that done i must say i understand why alais is in love with king henry patrick stewart is a very fine actor and has magnificent voice which he uses very well he is a very good match to close s queen i did not care for richard i thought he was not commanding enough bit whiny i think john is a difficult part to play to say the least and i didn t care for him either too much the idiot geoffrey on the other hand is really conniving and very good king philippe too much a boy although he has moments when the interaction with king henry makes him interesting alais good enough which of the versions do i prefer that is difficult i have highly enjoyed both i think the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of hepburn and i prefer her to close this version has a more emotional and sometimes romantic \( alais and henry \) approach i definitely prefer stewart to o toole who seemed too young for the role i liked the way stewart made us see henry s self confindence in his plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming \( that is until the end when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem falling apart \) o toole had a very serious approach all the time on the other hand anthony hopkins and timothy dalton were both splendid i think overall that the 1968 version has a better supporting cast which of the versions i watch depends on the mood i am in i think they are both good in their own way,positive

this production is misleadingly named far from being a biography of grand duchess anastasia it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century s enduring mysteries a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920 s among at least some people who had had contact with the original family i do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography after all how much of a biography can one write on a 17 year old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege however i do fault this production for being a badly flawed recounting of history and i am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of romanov history buffs about whether anna anderson was really anastasia this work s take on the life of anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the romanovs their support among their subjects and their reputation among today s russians first life in the inner sanctum of nicholas s family was not the halcyon existence this production claims certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal but neither nicholas nor alexandra were well suited to their roles and they lived under the strain of it they were increasingly isolated from the extended romanov clan who shared the dawning awareness of the russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble while these forces might not have touched anastasia directly she was certainly touched by her brother s hemophilia and her mother s response of sinking into frail health chronic emotional distress and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times secondly this film s portrayal of the counter revolutionary white army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong while the whites wanted to unseat the bolshevik revolution there was virtually no support for a romanov restoration among the leadership of the white army nor are there any known attempts by the counter revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family in fact one senior white military leader once remarked having seen the monarchy at close quarters i have no desire to see its return and thirdly while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last romanov s reputation underway in russia today the notion that the murdered romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims in fact the great masses of modern russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted romanovs back on a throne i do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the romanovs whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo history that plagues serious study of the russian monarchy s fading years or whether this production did not have access to newly opened archives but whatever the reason \( s \) it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is in fact closer to a grocery store romance novel,negative
this movie is very simple and unique it s the kind of love story which you really believe in while you re watching because it doesn t feel phony this can be credited to the acting the situation and the plot as well this isn t about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her that s all been done and that s what makes this film a breath of fresh air river phoenix shows why he is missed by so many and really allows you to connect with his character i recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art and be touched at the same time,positive
dmx stars as the drug dealer king david who pops up in the streets again after a long absence rolling into the frame in a player s classic a late 70 s stutz blackhawk king david shrugs his way back into the hard knock life he quickly reaps what he sows and mortally wounded passes all his worldly goods to paul \( david arquette \) a scrambling white would be writer king david s estate includes an audio journal of his life which provides flashbacks and a narrative within a narrative that answers the shaken paul s curiosity it s the highlights of king david s high life that propel alone like all of goines s heroes king david is a scourge on the periphery and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity every life he touches he leaves in ruins a need to deface beauty as a result of self loathing is implicit and dmx signals that motivation with sly hostility to say that king david is the best part he s ever had is an understatement he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before i would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist,positive

although i m a diehard fan of this great british sitcom i can t recommend this particular dvd of it when i received it i was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording comparing it side by side on the same tv with an old vhs recording i purchased years ago clearly showed that the dvd image quality was much poorer than the vhs i believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation vhs copy of the original recording to dvd instead of going back to the original the focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image which of course didn t help i doubt we ll ever watch this dvd because the eyestrain is too great if you don t have a good copy it would be better than nothing but not by much i was also disappointed in the extras the character biographies weren t of the characters in the series but of the actors very misleading there were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate dvd the radio broadcasts were interesting though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment also there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the dvd finally while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the tv screen this can lead to screen burning on some sets,negative

orange county as a movie tries to play it safe the director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film i must say for around 50 of the film i was laughing jack black is truly my favourite character in the film colin hanks the lead actor is a boring sophisticated person he also plays black s brother in the film although jack black doesnt have a huge role in it everytime he s on the screen i seem to forget all the other characters around i thought the scene in which he jumps into the swimming pool with just his under shorts was funny but i defintely feel there are some seven other scenes featuring this master of crazy comedy i didnt find colin hanks \( in the film \) inspiration inspiring at all and think he should have gone to stanford for the simple reason i believe he didnt have much enough at orange county to wait for but then that s a story flaw or story strength \( however you perceive it \) come to think of it colin hanks character was extremely realistic polite and believable now all the credit in the world to the director for this however it was the drugged jack black who really tries to get him into something ive seen school of rock and i m sorry for i did not like it as much as i liked orange county it s the presence of jack black that does it for me i ve seen the film 4 times which is probably why i can t stand hanks and his goodness anyhow forget all that watch the film rent it steal it buy it download it just give it a watch cheers,positive
when dvds came out i thought that cds were gone i thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling dvds instead of cds that s what happened with records cds came out and no one released vinyl anymore i am so glad that the sun was the first band to do this every song on this disk is golden there ain t a bad song in the bunch i heard about this disk on npr radio it seems that it was taking warner bros so long to release the cd that the band made homemade videos for all their songs the record company heard about this watched the videos and said that s cool here is some more money go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a dvd like it was a new idea or something i talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks all the songs are on the disk in wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell windows media player or whatever you use to put it on a regular cd and play it in your car or convert them into mp3s there is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the wav files i could go on and on about how much i love this disk i played it for my wife kids coworkers and they all loved it like other reviewers said the sun is a new classic keep it up boys,positive

the movie has a great story unlike streetfighter alpha the movie alpha generations actually follows the correct storyline it had the potential to be a great movie but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately the character design sucks \( why dosen t ryu look like ryu \) the english voice acting sucks \( i recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles \) and the fights suck the only fight worth watching during the whole movie is ryu vs sakura this film dosen t even deserve a 1 star rating i just gave it that because there s no way to go lower,negative

this is the first movie i remember seeing as a kid i loved it it was my favorite then i didn t get to see it again for several years \( stupid blockbuster \) when i finally saw it again i still liked it i like it as i write this very day the music is good \( the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to but helps the mood anyway \) the animation s good too and i actually know what i m talking about \( how often does that happen \) see what happens a lot of the time is that people blame colors they don t like or designs that are annoying or whatever on the animation but it isn t the animation s fault the way the thing on screen moves is the only thing the animators do mostly so if you really want to criticize the animation look at how they move not what they look like do you see i think that really most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about books when i was little my dad read me the lion the witch and the wardrobe and the hobbit things like that so naturally i loved books and stories this is practically the only movie i ve seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere it s obvious that the filmmakers themselves \( or at least a lot of the people working on it \) actually like to read that s really why i like the pagemaster so if you like to read watch this movie if you don t \( you utter nincompoop \) stay away and don t criticize what you have no comprehension of,positive
granted i saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party but i think i had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was it s so bad it has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved and the script was just awful gosh it s hard to believe i actually sat through it it was just so exactly what it was i guess a stupid sex comedy that s absolutely terrified to be anything else the thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material i think my real downfall here was the fact that i m a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys the scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it s almost ridiculous now i m not one to get offended easily but this just took it a bit too far just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed which isn t really something i look for in a movie it just seems to me that if gay had been replaced with black this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn t ever have been released not that i m condoning censorship but when your tone becomes so mocking i guess oh well i guess all i m trying to say is i will definitely not be repeat viewing this film and i don t recommend you view it at all if you re a woman or gay or you care about others,negative
i have loved thie movie ever since seeing it on late night tv i had to search a long time to find it on video before dvd was an option and i have been waiting impatiently for release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out the gradual awakening of young ta to which girl is truly right for him and sammy fong s attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although the latter was often cut out during late night broadcasts the ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched from james shigeta to a professional dancer afterall it s the music and the story that make this great,positive
some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and too slow i m not a film maker and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong the film is amazing i m not sure if there is any other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller cum dictator cum statesman is like nowadays people might not know who idi amin is or what he did so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie he plays accordian you see him meeting with his advisors \( some of whom disappear so after \) you see him play acting like a grown up boy with toy soldiers you see his self appointed royal pedigree and send his support for nixon its fascinating and amazing this is man that self proclaimed actually ate some of his rivals \( not the whole body i hope \) he killed many people directly and by his policies his ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie apparently there is a new movies coming out about idi amin starring forrest whitaker he s a good actor and so i look forward to seeing it but this is the real guy its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again,positive
the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical though different characters and locations are used the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this remake is quite frankly terrible bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman which was fairly amusing but hardly essential and a tacked on conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous i won t explain it theres no point watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though even die hards admit its awful i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst \( yes even worse than this \),negative

this movie was only slightly better than your basic horror cliche the nuclear testing mutant premise seemed promising but all the main characters were stupid annoying seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters the script writers director threw in lots of unnecessary gore for the most part though the special effects were at least well done however a few of the effects were somewhat misguided for instance blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red wouldn t it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat acting was mediocre i ve never seen the original so i cannot say whether this is better or worse the movie is not for the faint of heart simply because of the gore but it definitely wasn t very scary two stars,negative

to be or not to be is a comedy set during wwii although it makes light of a tense time in history it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease the story revolves around two actors in poland maria and joseph tura joseph \( jack benny \) specializes in overplaying hamlet and maria \( carole lombard \) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his to be or not to be speech the man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation although she is working for the allies a nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess the film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting it is a real shame that carole lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne,positive

the virgin suicides starring kristen dunst josh hartnett kathleen turner and james woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline this film is directed by sofia coppola \( lost in translation \) i really tried to like this movie but i was fooling myself you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the coppola legacy but just because your father is frances ford coppola doesn t mean you belong in the same category as best director of all time sometimes magic does not stirke twice how can all five sisters end up killing themselves their homelife wasn t that unbearable a lot of parents are religious but that doesn t mean you ll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide kristen dunst just gets on my nerves her acting is the same in every film don t believe the hype the virgin suicides is not a groundbreaking poetic film,negative

synopsis \( including ending \) don ameche \( gino \) a chicago shoe shine man is approached by the mafia to go to jail for 3 to 5 years to take the place of their mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him they ll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat joe mantegna \( jerry \) takes don ameche \( gino \) on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he s incarcerated joe mantegna is on probation from the mob after disobeying orders from a previous job joe mantegna goes outside channels to take don ameche \( gino \) to lake tahoe to the galaxy hotel where they stay wine and dine and try to have a good time things turn difficult when a local real mafia boss brings don ameche \( gino \) to his house as a guest and they form a bond the real mafia boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and don ameche and joe mantegna are caught in the middle they escape the gathering and on the day don ameche is brought back to chicago joe mantegna is ordered to kill don ameche and make it look like a suicide it s cleaner this way he s told joe mantegna refuses the order and the film ends with a mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life the good joe mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real mafia boss in lake tahoe other than that there s nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge the bad the mob wants tough guys right this is a comedy right no ones a tough guy and there s no laughs joe mantegna plays a sissy instead of a mafia tough guy don ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality i wanted to like this film but i coulden t because it was very slow very boring and none of the characters were interesting we never have a scene with the real mafia boss that looks like don amecha and the two never meet you would expect a friendly thanks for going to jail for 3 to 5 years for me but it doesn t happen at the end someone for the mob is dressed up like the real mafia boss and he s testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail he doesn t look anything like don ameche or the real mafia boss and yet he s right there taking the fall if the film didn t need to depend on don ameche s appearance why didn t they send him to jail from the beginning the worst david mamet experience i ve had very surprising stinker the characters if don ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting if joe mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them he would have been more interesting as the film stands they re both flat don ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used when a character says something you can be sure don ameche repeats it 30 minutes later like a senile robot don ameche s dialogue leaves a lot to be desired add to that his boring and stale acting in this film he played very dumb not interesting like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money overall joe mantegna was not believable as a mafia hired hand don ameche was too passive and uninteresting and joe mantegna is too passive and stale scene criticism a couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic \( gas station scene where joe mantegna is given 3 more in gas than he asked for \) joe mantegna is working for the mob and he asks for 1 of gas and gets 4 he doesn t have the cash to pay and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is please please please a real mob guy would punch the gas attendant take back the keys and leave for the plane they were late for a mob guy that won t defend himself for 3 \( scene with don ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years \) don ameche doesn t put up a fight or try to leave the room and is too passive we don t learn about his past or his life or family there s not enough time spent on the offer and the scene was over valued for it s lasting value \( bedroom scene with joe mantegna trying to let don ameche escape \) joe mantegna had no real connection to don ameche s character to justify the scene instead it s 2 strangers personal commentary the test for a comedy for me is how many times did i laugh this film never made me laugh i m shocked the film costs 24 99 on dvd rent it instead it belongs in the 1 bin at wal mart writing criticism lines like he s the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy and lines like a big man knows the value of a small coin and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense the writing is drivel alternative recommended film trading places with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy and also don ameche albeit in a smaller role,negative

first of all yes this film was made in vancouver with only a few shots of the manhattan skyline when golden harvest was making this film they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn t show any mountains and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night then jackie chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action well action was what they focused on the most indeed it sure is funny to see how the chinese thought of the united states at this time because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls you also get multi ethnic gangs trashing places \( seriously the gang has a native american with pigtails and a frayed jacket that s almost offensive \) you have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars you have random small crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits bizarre indeed as for the actions this film has some of his best the first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb and graceful using his jacket to dispatch enemies and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over he takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered very impressive this leads to a scene where he s being chased around the streets of new york where the entire gang on motor cycles try to run him over and jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey he also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building no harness or wiresupport the fight scene at the gang s hideout is also one his best using whatever object he can get his hands ont and very acrobatic also jackie chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land some of this was done on a broken ankle if this dvd was uncut and undubbed and had the original score i d give it a total of three stars unfortunately for a so so film new line makes it worse some of the dubbing is very bad it seems as if new line dubbed some of the original english dialouge also only very very little of the original cantonese dialouge is there also the film s original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock many many scenes were cut from the original movie not only that but some of the action scenes were cut too try and find an uncut version out there this dvd you should stay away from,negative
in 1987 and 1988 jim henson s the storyteller aired and became an instant showpiece for television a truimphant \( but short lived \) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser known northern european fairy tales and later into four timeless stories drawn from greek mythology these old folk and fairy tales mined from countries such as germany and russia and compiled in 2 discs here along with the greek tales are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers john hurt for the european fables and michael gambon for the greek re tellings but with much respect to mr gambon who himself does a fine job it is john hurt who decidedly draws my attention hurt with the more eye catching portrayal is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes it doesn t hurt that the stories featuring hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by anthony minghella who nearly a decade later would win an oscar for directing the english patient as such jim henson s the storyteller gloriously lives up to its titular billing john hurt s performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make up he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories minghella s screenplays are replete with rich witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up the kids of course won t have that frame of reference but still watching these episodes it really does feel as if you re sitting around the fire enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns michael gambon on the other hand is burdened with the weightier and grimmer greek tales thus he eschews john hurt s light ebullient touch opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona he s pretty good mind you but in the final analysis he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to john hurt both hurt and gambon by the way are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog \( as operated by brian henson \) at a half hour per episode jim henson s the storyteller is presented in a marriage of live acting creative animatronics and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery jim henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values coming up with excellent special effects \( for its time \) seamless puppetry matte paintings and yeoman make up work all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting a charming quirk of the series which adds a nice touch is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the storyteller and his dog the camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace but somewhere in the background whether it s on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup images depicting the story are set in motion pretty neat the stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid s fable we re used to over here especially the greek entries and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones \( the soldier and death the heartless giant \) but don t keep the kids from watching this series everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories it does help that most of these tales are little known in the states thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there when was the last time cinderella or beauty and the beast timeless as they are offer up anything new this is just about as perfect as television shows can get the only flaw i can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever all the episodes are superb but if i had to pick the best of the pack i would definitely go with hans my hedgehog the soldier and death and the three ravens with

i ordered this dvd series because i liked kristy alleys performance in other movies and series but this is totally different a lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted after viewing two episodes i put it in the trash watching this does not make me happy,negative
my husband received this dvd for his birthday my husband grew up with the pittsburg steelers and still today is a true fan as a family we all sat and watched this wonderful dvd on the steelers and all of us enjoyed it very much it goes back to the begining of time for the steelers it shows the superbowls and how the steel curtin got it s name if you love the steelers then this 2 dvd set is a must have you will not be disappointed,positive
the first x men movie was fantastic the second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better this third movie was absolute trash and i will never buy it,negative
how can people like this piece of trash what a stinker i think the dad died from boredom after listening to his two idiot sons and all that endless talk about the institute which looked like it was setup in someone s garage i can understand why some bikers would find this flick motivational it motivated me to turn off the t v and go for a ride i really believe this movie was produced by satan,negative
how could mr cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody the production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos but the script and dialogue are so banal the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another \( including leo who was so good in what s eating gilbert grape in 1993 when i didn t yet know who he was i thought he was really a cute little retarded kid yet in titanic there s just nothing there or nothing permitted \) talk about a ship wreck only the two studio backed block voting resulted in the record tying oscar wins nominations,negative
i seen this movie don t buy it it s not worth anything i have it on vhs boring action purchase the other three home alones they re the best than this movie,negative
well almost the seats were good and i drank straight out of the bottle the dvd wasn t what i thought i had purchased but i m not at all unhappy about getting it very very very good quality audio video and i don t mind watching it often,positive
for sheer excitement you cannot beat this dvd the music is exciting arranged well for brass ensemble and recorded with high quality but that s only the beginning in blast the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform how they manage this energy level will flat out amaze you i can honestly say that after just seeing these performances you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be prepare to be thrilled,positive
this movie was awfull supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion,negative
i expected so much more from this movie i guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors \( jolie washington \) and also had the always on point queen latifah as well i watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie but i walked away bitter with shattered expectations first off i will say that latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason i smiled on occasion during this movie experience washington and jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable \( especially washington who really strained in this role \) that i was constantly asking myself do i really like these two and i had to remind myself of movies like gia and training day to answer with a resounding yes the film follows a rookie cop \( jolie \) as she helps a quadriplegic ex cop lincoln \( washington \) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called the bone collector the ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer while not who you d pinpoint is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever it s like oh so he she did it interesting and i m bored i d skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling,negative
i ll get to the plot of the gang s all here in a minute because the plot isn t the most memorable part of this movie the most memorable part is the bananas about 20 minutes into the movie a towering hat of technicolor fruitappears on the screen followed by its owner brazilian bombshell carmen miranda she proceeds to do a number called the lady in the tutti frutti hat accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas six foot tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number s end when the chorus girls worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island there s a reason this number occurs so early on it takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie but then this is busby berkeley a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war and next to kitsch war is pretty much the motivator here the wafer thin story involves andy \( james ellison \) a soldier who woos and wins edie \( alice faye \) a canteen dancer the nightbefore andy goes off to world war two in what seems an instant andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of andy s childhood sweetheart and fiancee who unfortunately for edie is not edie will the heartbreak be resolved do you really care the plot is mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major 40s stars \( in particular eugene pallette and edward everett horton are hilarious \) and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out of thin air \( in a couple of scenes benny goodman and his orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of it \) the gang s all here is really a 1943 time capsule but an eye popping rouser of one they don t make em like this anymore they didn t make em much like this back then either,positive
how can you rate something that hasn t been released especially since lionsgate ruined season 5 by releasing the shortened syndicated versions while still writing on the box the complete 5th season debbie harry is credited on the box while her scene was omitted this along with many others they completely ruined the boxed set by issuing shortened crappy syndicated episodes this is coming from a huge w g fan or should i say k j fan,negative
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that can t be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics,negative
i saw this for a good price i checked for reviews there were all theese great reviews whatever the movie has pretty much no action the sound video actin is good but its lonngg and sloowww there was some good nudity that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie i love falcons so there you go i think of it as good enough to keep thats it maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend take this as the downside review so all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all tha,negative
wow i bought this set a couple of months ago and i ve been watching each episode little by little and enjoying each one of them a lot it s interesting to watch captain scarlet again thirty something years after the last time i watched it back in the late 60s \( when i was 7 or 8 years old \) i was \( and still am \) a huge fan of the thunderbirds and became quite delighted when this new series from gerry anderson first appeared on tv back in the 60s the quality of captain scarlet s special effects obviously got better since the thunderbirds and it really makes a huge difference \( as far as realism is concerned \) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned so much so that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes the production still looks fabulous after all these years the design of vehicles machines personal equipment weapons buildings etc is quite enjoyable interesting and sometimes even surprising the angels \( both airplanes and pilots \) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age for they look quite dated indeed however now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 chrysler and ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series thirty something years later most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow almost stupid but one has to remember that this series was meant for children so once you remember this you ll be ready to have a great time watching captain scarlet and his fellow spectrum buddies fight the evil mysterons \( led by the sinister looking captain black \) just as you did when you were still a child spectrum is green enjoy it,positive
once again i truly benefitted from another ellen barrett workout dvd her cueing instruction and professionalism show it she knows how to turn what some consider a tedious plain exercise into a spot on fun enjoyable and worth it workout,positive
this film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9 11 \( it s plot included terrorists that sell a bomb \) i also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on tim allen and the comparisons to get shorty rather than as a plot driven movie i tell you though this film is simply funny just like an old marx brothers film the plot is there only to set in motion the quick witted dialogue and interaction between the characters i have enjoyed both of dave barry s humor novels \( this and tricky business \) they made me laugh out loud as did this movie i think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly for those that have laughed at dennis farina from his roles in get shorty and even snatch he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks \( literally \) on his trip to do a quick sniper job tom sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you ll ever see there are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh no matter how many times you have seen it check this one out,positive
i was blown away by the wonderful acting of juliet lewis and giovanni ribisi who played the retarded young adults this was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else it was wonderful to see the love carla s siblings and parents had for her there were 2 reasons i didn t give this movie 5 stars one was that diane keaton s character of the overly controlling mother was annoying obviously she was supposed to be annoying but i think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again another reason i didn t love this film was because hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good sorry hollywood but there will always be those of us who still believe god s word to be true being a right wing nut job isn t considered normal or ok in the bible god never created it look it up you are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle,positive
while the story may be entertaining in its own right and any chance to see donald o conner dance is worth it this can be a very disappointing film to porter buffs the plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship the story line is totally different and therefore some of porter s original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of sammy cahn and james van huesen which do not live up to porter s quality the best examples i can give is the fact that there is no evangelist so the title song anything goes turns into a second act number sung by mitzi and chorus \( with horrific word changes \) and blow gabriel blow becomes a finale in the broadway show \( sung by the four main characters \) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line if you haven t seen it on stage it s pleasant enough but if you re expecting the broadway show it s a major disappointment,negative
the whole point of this ghost story is like in the orinigal a surprise twisted ending yet once again in a 90 s hollywood horror flick it is dissappointing the actors within the movie are actually pointless and show no effect but there not to blame the blame is the poor script writing for this movie the movie has you going until about half way through when they introduce the ghost to you now unlike any other ghost in hollywood history this ghost is literally a black blob it contains some invisible bodies and haunts people with its face which in turn reveals the face of whom it kills but literally when you put a 100 foot ghost into a movie you better make sure its in the right one this movie should probably been called the blob not house on haunted hill it is a horrible re make and a waste of about 2 hours please for your own sake rent some good genre horror like halloween or when a stranger calls not some crappy remake that wants to make you leave the room your watching it in better luck next time to the director producer co producer and writer of this film because of all the people that took part probably just wanted to make some cheap money so they made a movie better luck next time,negative
this is a thuroughly enjoyable movie a pleasure to watch the acting characters and story are entirely plausible and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors nor is there any of hollywood s usual political preachiness \( especially unusual considering robert redford s backing \) the only downside to the dvd is that it is full screen and not letterboxed the bonus features are somewhat lack luster as well and the menu system is laughable only one actor s credits have been updated since the movie was released and the credits section is a token gesture at best still this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice,positive
i bought this for my 3yr old twins and from the first showing i kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons my girls already are familiar with some fairy tales so they really loved the three little pigs and the pied piper i highly recommend this dvd and think it is a great buy for parents with young children,positive
gene hackman is jedidiah tucker ward an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere on the other side of this gap of good and evil is maggie ward jed s headstrong daughter between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people the premise suggests the ending jed will win the day but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney jed will fight the good fight \( which will require supreme grandstanding \) while maggie learns just how amoral her side really is what robs this courtroom thriller is what s missing in virtually every courtroom thriller a case that could go either way an actual case in controversy maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them instead of a compelling case we have one that s ready for our verdict as soon as we ve seen the suits worn by either side or their offices the case in class action is one you can typify as david goliath which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power there s no way that we re going to see a case won \( even by dishonest means \) by donald moffat s hired band of harvard trained professional liars and there s no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments maggie s bosses are so transparently bad that not only do they screw up but even their explanations are patently evil even so the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless for a thriller about high paid lawyers class action has all the legal acumen of high school mock trial with fewer suprises,negative
a 130 minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality this swedish import doesn t so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place wouldn t know what to do with it if you did have it and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts the plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as well worn which seems to be a euphemism for shop worn clich or stupefyingly unoriginal here it is \( spoilers follow \) daniel a big shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood takes over and revives the local church choir heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness finds love finds his inner child and finally at the moment of his and his choir s greatest triumph croaks a great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program but kay pollack isn t up to it instead in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness he celebrates embraces wallows in the schmaltz throws it at you until it s dripping off you like oobleck and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film indeed there s something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent albeit of the ed wood variety and while watching it i almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind as in the kingsley amis story about the poet who at the end of a long and successful career publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs \( speaking of whom as it is in heaven was nominated for best foreign film at the oscars in 2005 after being strewn with similar honors in sweden where it was reportedly seen by some two million viewers we re used to this kind of idiocy from the academy but what s going on in the country of strindberg and bergman has someone been putting something in the k ttbullar \) a standard feature of movies like this \( and books like this if it comes to that cf ayn rand \) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant aiiih is no exception the parade of didactic marionettes includes daniel s love interest a ditzy twenty year old blonde who represents the life force the humorless sexually repressed hypocritical preacher who represents the church which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity especially in modern scandinavia the wife beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates and then finally locks up and forgives who represents violence and what to do about it the retarded kid whom daniel insists on letting into the choir chiefly so that he can become the film s symbol of the virtues of inclusiveness and the deep human wisdom of special people \( incidentally it s about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people in movie after movie as symbols of purity goodness wisdom beyond the ken of those cursed with normal intelligence or whatever is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them it just seems nicer can t we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being the only one i can recall seeing is best boy a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago apart from that they ve been reduced to targets of witless ridicule as in there s something about mary or turned into plaster saints as here \) so to sum up save your money and your time which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of the o c run don t walk from your local art theater if this is the main attraction and don t forget the moral of the story rather comforting to me as an expatriate american living in a europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis vis the usa kitsch is global,negative
before i saw this movie i thought i would enjoy it i enjoyed watching the miniseries when i was a kid however nothing could prepare me for what i was about to watch on screen it was an absolute disaster of a film i do enjoy superhero movies some recent ones i like are the spiderman series and batman but the hulk did not inspire me at all it was like going to the dentist to get a tooth pulled the character is a cartoon like green figure totally lacking in his emotional capacities not even his rage convinced me it looked like a video game more than a movie this film had no serious plot worthy of mention it was just plain painful to watch if i could give it half a star i would,negative

like her legendary mother nobody around today takes command of the stage like liza minnelli and this legendary event at new york s radio city music hall clearly illustrates this always a five star event in concert i have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from 1970 to 2005 and i am here to say that she has still got it and always will in recent years for some silly reason that i don t get the media has tried to damage liza s artistic credibility but it doesn t work when liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary superstar numerous standing ovations later it is clear that liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper bravo liza and keep on rocking,positive
men of a certain age will remember how when we were kids and this was played on tv in the early 80s we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops but those two over the top scenes are all this movie has going for it the other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter and atop a parking structure both of whom were in can t miss positions and missed anyway moreover if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly it involves eastwood being sent from phoenix to las vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to arizona for a trial the witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the phoenix police commissioner and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup assuming a material witness can be extradited which i doubt the crime appears to have been committed in vegas so it would tried in vegas not phoenix and if the ada prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner he could just dismiss the case and there would be no need to murder the witness the idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous in sum the plot and the action were both absurd and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus but those two scenes probably can t carry the entire movie for the average viewer,negative

based on bizet s tragic spanish opera this was rita hayworth s first film made by her production company beckworth \( derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter rebecca \) she decided on her close friend and favorite leading man glenn ford as don jose to her carmen the results are far better than some reviews would have you believe the glorious lush techincolor is fabulous \( studio bound as most of the sets may be \) while hayworth s unforgettable screen presence dancing and bewitching beauty and the heat generated between her and ford makes this movie memorable the sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have \( complete with putting her finger to his lips \) sparkles with sensual static granted ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform \( after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his bandit clothing he appears much more relaxed \) if it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the columbia classics collection so should affair in trinidad another hayworth ford collaboration it s just great to look at flaws aside if you adore rita and glenn even in a tempestuous volatile romance this movie will provide that for you was there ever a more enticing tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love,positive

there s not much to say about the reputation of these movies there s also little to say about these dvds many of which are the high quality special edition collections just do the math this is no brainer for people who don t own any of these dvds even if you only want 8 of them \( less than half \) that s about 20 00 a movie \( at amazon s present sales price \) and since many of these movies are special editions that s still a steal this is a solid place to start your dvd collection not everyone will enjoy all these movies \( after all they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals \) but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings one note the version of amadeus here is the reissue and the longer director s cut of the movie that was not originally released some \( including myself \) prefer the tighter original release \( which can still be gotten at amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie \),positive
the basic pilates mat exercises are performed which are okay however the cardio segment of this video is truly lame the instructor runs the viewer through marching marching and stretching one s arm at the same time and finally marching and kicking back one s leg that s it how incredibly dull what s worse the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration pilates for dummies is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates \( do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio \) i wouldn t waste your time w this video,negative
i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most over the top performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans close up after close up conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not so famous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you re under arrest they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino s colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior don t waste your money or on line rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too,negative
\( 4 5 5 stars \) exceptional envisioning of the batman comic book by tim burton michael keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in batman begins both are equally effective though one style over the other will likely appeal to you is there any topping jack nicholson in his role as jack napier the joker only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie even though his role is suitably funny there is a little too much humor overall in the movie robert wuhl s character is especially unnecessarily comical also while danny elfman s score is duly heroic and compelling the music by prince just doesn t mesh well and is probably not the best choice nonetheless the visuals are stunning the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining it is a testament to the film s influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used danny elman scores \( including rival marvel s spider man \) and molded black rubber suits though this film also owes much to 1978 s superman with its realistic approach and a list villains great stuff,positive
the scene where eric idle whines oh you re no fun anymore is a deceptive one if anything these guys are even more fun than before the second half of monty python s flying circus s first season is even more polished and mad than the first continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity in these episodes we have a serial killer barber lecherous art critics an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral tunnel to java and jump the english channel ken shabby every girl s dad s nightmare thuggish old ladies bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla camel spotting and prime ministers falling through the earth s crust the longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into scotsmen and streaming north of the border soon scotland will be choked with scotsmen and england is pretty much abandoned the culprits tennis playing human devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of andromeda and of course the stuff that has become comedy legend the scene where john cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store \( it s a stiff bereft of life it rests in peace \) and the lumberjack song \( i cut down trees i skip and jump i like to press wild flowers i put on women s clothing and hang around in bars \) of course no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these dozens of skits these five brits \( and one american who did the little cartoons \) created some of the most unabashed naughty nasty and just plain weird comedy ever which still influences everything from saturday night live to author jasper fforde and all of this by men who often dress up as the world s most unattractive girls with only a tiny budget and minimal cast the 70s production values are omnipresent and they are decidedly unpolitically correct but in a weird way these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise the writing and acting are pure raw unrefined comedy probably the most memorable actors here are cleese and idle cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice and eric idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber while michael palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane by this point the monty python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance in other words it s funny and should be watched,positive

this was the word used by one reviewer and it just about sums up the film another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto biographical and introspective pieces of work usually these are binned as the person matures asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well heeled to let her have her way on film instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority but good art is more than self expression self promotion self pity and self indulgence it should have a satisfying underlying form say something new to its audience expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know especially if it s told in a semi familiar way most of what asia says in this film we do already know if we are half aware of what goes on around us still the girl has a cute face and she s put a lot of effort into this performance something more may come with time,negative
i really enjoyed this film basically the coen bros homage to the film noir genre \( i always thought the name was funny since it s french and yet most of famous directors were german like fritz lang otto preminger etc \) \) the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool unhurried nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey thornton is great in the lead as the reticent phlegmatic barber and if anything he is even more convincing with hair than without even his hairpiece is 50s ish \) the whole cast does a fine job in their roles and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of show stealing scenes i found the film s climax a complete surprise as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber for whom everything seems to be working out up till then overall a great film and probably one of the coen bros best if you re a coen bros fan you won t find this one a disappointment,positive

when i first purchased the low budget movie named pranks i didn t really know what to expect after all pranks is a slasher horror movie from the 80s a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general unfortunately after viewing pranks i can honestly say that this is not one of them pranks is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down i think \( herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor \) obviously most kids have gone home for christmas and new year s except for this group of kids and one weird kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur the murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged the plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic generic and lacks luster throughout the film one of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie there is no question that pranks is a low budget production to begin with and along with that there is going to be some subpar acting but the acting in pranks is borderline awful it is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested in fact the movie comes off very generic in style and substance and rather predictable and boring the only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which aren t too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from the director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the weird guy as a red herring as another reviewer put it in summary pranks is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting extremely poor production values and flawed direction the result is a dull boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills certainly nothing to write home about also as a final note the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off in the end at least like a total wuss,negative
the problem with this film is i read the book i was disappointed simply because be cool is an obvious showcase for the musical talent the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example somewhere the bulk of the story was lost and there are some very very good characters appearing in the film that would ve been more intersing if somebody would ve said hey don t forget the book but being true to the original source is not hollywood s strong suit be cool provides some popular music some known faces but without john travolta the movie would never have been made a few laughs are provided a couple ironic scenes show up but there s too little to sustain a full length feature basically the project is a disservice to everyone involved some of the characters are so thin face it poor christina milian as linda moon is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings a clich the rock does the best he can but again he s a gay bodyguard he s the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji his boss vince vaughn who in the book is far more sinister but in the film he s an idiot of course chili is chili travolta does a very nice job and chili s obviously the smartest guy in the room uma thruman s performance is well not funny not serious not intense not much at best she made me shrug i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr but there s just not enough and all the negatives reflect completely on the director enough said there my advice watch get shorty again or read be cool,negative
i was hoping that socermania would be on the extreme sports fun dvd but no instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the disney treasures this also goes for the other two dvd s extreme music and adventure fun allthough pluto s blue note donald s dilemma no sail old sequoia and trailer horn are on dvd for the first time but with the new disney treasures disney rarities and the chronological donald volume 2 \( which might i add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration \) who needs these dvds so i suggest not to buy these cheap dvd s and buy the treasures in spite of the bad restoration,negative

ridiculous plot one dimensional cardboard like acting \( especially leon lai s rigid dead like fish out of water performance \) incoherent dialogs horrible editing and directing every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline nothing deep but shallow all the way just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves long sleeves and black cloak even the white pigeons turned out to be dead nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat nothing at all curtain call drop it sooner than later,negative
it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes it gets shocks like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes it gets more interesting as the plot unravels great actors picked for such roles the perfect killing machines one insane in the brain and one out to save lives that shouldn t be lost in the first place the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says i just want to eat i don t wanna hurt you then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal and his reporter female friend comes in and says good meal as a question that is and he says without words makes a happy sigh that s hilarious and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food priceless movie worth the watch again and again i m glad i saw this on tv when i was younger and i m glad i got this on dv,positive
what a disaster stay away from this film i was so disappointed how could this have won the academy award the story is rambling and confused as if the filmmakers couldn t decide what story they wanted to tell the animation is very average with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes in fact those all important happy feet of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit \( that s supposed to be tap dancing that s supposed to be animation \) the jokes aren t particularly funny \( with the exception of a few moments in the middle where robin williams briefly shines \) and oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing there s not a single original song or even an inspired remake of any of the songs think billy elliot meets the march of the penguins with some of gore s an inconvenient truth mixed in without any of the wit charm intelligence passion or beauty in any of those films \( did i mention that this film is a disaster \) perhaps most annoyingly like the rest of the story the underlying political message alternates between cliched confused and heavy handed the ending is especially unbearable with its tacked on feel and absurd psuedo environmentalist feel good solution what a joke personally i consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions \( i ve been a vegetarian for more than 20 years and a member of sierra club and peta for example \) yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message one final note for those of you with children this is not really a kids movie most of the jokes won t be understood by children under 15 for kids under 6 all this feeble film offers is some too scary shamus \( orcas \) a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid friendly forums as the united nations \( what the heck \) after sitting through the entire film to this point my four year old son finally turned to me and quietly said this is not a movie for me i couldn t have agreed more,negative

i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars but after watching it again i realized i liked it better \( i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you \) i do not consider all of the performances goth martiya possesion are more tribal than anything \( at least on this video \) and i really dislike the expression or lack thereof on their faces while they are dancing they either look completely bored pissed off or smug i skip right over it i also did not care for asharah s dance to the drum solo by solace \( opaque \) the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all the music is saying fast big upbeat and she s standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves and of course we all love the s m piece excuse me s m is not part of the goth subculture and has no place on a bellydance video jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer but she didn t dance much on this and i didn t want to see what was on her part another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music i like solace and all but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre there were a few but not enough for my liking my favorites on this video were tempest ariellah jeniviva and ayshe \( for wierdness factor \) for all of its faults this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose,positive

i have owned a copy of this film for a long time i have probably watched it ten times and i always tear up a little at each viewing from the beginning newsreel of a shell shocked diane feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of harvey milk and mayor george moscone to the final reel of harvey milk s prophetic and haunting statements the viewer is mesmerized though harvey milk was a san francisco city supervisor his election in the 1970 s that of an open and unrepentant gay man made national headlines he was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere who at that time were unrepresented and for the most part still forced into the closet this film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of harvey milk but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time milk was a very eloquent speaker and his sensibility logic and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent this is best displayed in the footage of his debate with then california senator briggs a buffoon like character who not only was a terrible speaker who couldn t even clearly express his arguably irrational fears but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis milk the public view at that time was about family values with the anita bryants condeming homosexuals to hell for their decadent ways \( old times come round again \) milk s voice opposed this view openly and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented the notion of this martyrdom and its romantic though fateful attraction to milk has been argued nevertheless his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message nor the admiration he deserves this film unfolds as it happened seeming like fiction but all too real as milk is assassinated along with the mayor by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor dan white whose subsequent trial with the famous twinkie defense and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen as one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation if only the mayor had been killed white would have gotten life but the fact that milk a gay man had also been killed leaned public sympathy towards white an absurd but all too realistic conclusion there are many moving telling historically signifigant moments in this film but none so clearly represents those times and milk s loss and legacy as the film of the nighttime march in san francisco right after the murders seas of people holding candles and standing silently came together in a very moving moment in time this film which won best documentary at that years oscars transcends its subject matter and is simply a great documentary gay rights have made much progress and perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all excluding those who were there are old enough to remember or are gay nonetheless harvey milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement and his legacy through schools named after him organizations and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless lives on,positive
for a plot synopsis please read the amazon review i wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film as a longtime fan of both sam raimi \( of the evil dead series \) and bill paxton \( aliens twister \) i went to see this on opening night not many people can claim this i m sure because it was and is such a small film that received next to no marketing for shame this film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including blood simple and fargo both made by the cohen brothers film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers so i won t bother to get into that should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them i suggest you stop reading and immediately rent a simple plan if not keep reading and i will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant and why i hope you will take a look at it a simple plan is at its core about four people and underneath all the plot devices and twists it s about how they relate to one another notice i did t say characters because this film doesn t have actors simply delivering dialogue it s about people you get to know understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas sure finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device but the heart of this film is much simpler than that it s about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it and being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process that s what gives this film such depth you watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash and in the end it falls apart for two reasons the details and the human factor they say the devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime as for the human factor where greed is concerned people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person s greed while are unable satisfy their own in many respects this film is almost an homage to blood simple and fargo but in many ways i think it is superior i often draw the comparison by a scene which is both a simple plan and blood simple where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of and even afterwards after the emotional toll the has been taken once one evil act is committed another is sure to follow it s so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera frantically going over the details in their mind all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute bill paxton does this better than anyone he is such a likable man \( both in the film and in life \) that you can t help but feel sorry for the mess he has created his entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife that may make them all sound malicious but really the opposite is actually true they re all normal folks like we ve all seen a hundred times and in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in after all were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss what would you do but then again nothing is ever that simple,positive

this is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations this film s strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them sean connery plays captain marko ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film tim curry is amusing as the dutiful dr petrov in a role well suited for him the rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of sean connery and tim curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film alec baldwin as jack ryan james earl jones as admiral james greer sam neill as captain vasily borodin scott glenn as commander bart mancuso richard jordan as dr jeffrey pelt and an impressive peter firth as political officer ivan putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story this was probably one of alec baldwin s best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of jack ryan should have been portrayed baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of jack ryan embodied sam neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country s political dictates and ambitions sam neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly i liked scott glenn s character immensely as the us commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him the list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film their efforts make this film a great political action adventure and emotional drama,positive
running with scissors is a slice of life movie which spends time leering into the lives of eccentrics and then ends with no revelations or culminating event unfortunately what comes before the movie fails to culminate is not very profound or insightful it is marginally entertaining and somewhat troubling the lead character in the movie is a 15 year old his parents divorce and his selfish mother sends him to live with her charlatan psychoanalyst and his similarly acquired family lead is on course to become a writer \( who eventually writes the non fiction account upon which this movie is based \) but we see little of his efforts to develop himself as a writer all the performances were serviceable save for gwyneth paltrow who lazily regurgitates a role she played previously annette benning is also essentially revisiting a role she played in a better movie mrs benning performed excellently and selflessly but the similarity of the roles intruded on my view of the movie it is a sure sign that hollywood is producing too many dysfunctional family flicks when all actors have been consigned to act in them and some actors are serving a second term also growing tiresome is the treatment of gays in movies the presence of one or more characters has become a requirement in films that explore a set of quirky characters furthermore the gays are stereotypically endowed with greater passion and depth of emotion and are put upon or stifled by the stodgy straights the most promising characters are the psychoanalyst s wife and adopted daughter the movie has some colorful and funny scenes but these are not enough to justify a viewing,negative
dvd 1 presents a terrific hour long history of the franchise it hits both the high and lowpoints and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history lambeau hutson lombardi starr nitschke the ice bowl favre white the nine nfl championships the three super bowls they won \( i ii and xxxi \) and the one they lost \( xxxii \) the best fans in the league the smallest venue the most legendary stadium and the team s miraculous survival over 80 years in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans the highpoint of course is the 15 minute section entitled lombardi which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl s greatest coach but at the end of this dvd about the packers heroic ongoing history you realize that as great as lombardi was the team is greater still dvd 2 was produced earlier in vhs format \( i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb \) and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history other reviewers have justly praised its play by play reconstruction and modern day interviews with the participants yes kramer was offside but luck is a part of any game and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter like another reviewer i love the postgame interviews even the glimpses of green bay in 1967 the muted colors of the frigid game \( maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s i see the same thing in footage of other games \) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed,positive

fraser s film is truly a winner in production quality his attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film eye candy performers lighting fantastic musical score and riske scenes this film has visually appealing sequences if anyone is interested in film and theatrical production i would highly recommend the director s commentary you really get an insight to an artist in process from the commentary it seems that fraser will never be finished with this film a mentale that i admire in an artist art is a process and is never perfect this is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future this film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people i did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide i feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs i had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as selfish gay guy ruins a marriage \( on the other hand cherilee taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script she wasn t quite the victim her character ultimately could have become \) by the end of the film i was wondering how violet was making it as a once again as single woman from an audience s standpoint we didn t really see that david and kryla make up matt goes to illustration school but what happens to violet overall i would highly recommend this film with such a great interpretation on the screen it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres,positive

i liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times i like to watch any movie that involves gangs \( especially bloods crips \) so i can learn from them if you re looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies you may not want this one in your collection becuase to me it doesn t show enough bloods crips in it the characters are fictional there are some minor gangs in it as well called the white fences \( latino hispanic gang i ve never heard of this gang so i don t know if they are true or not \) the actors who play the gang members of the white fences are good actors though i think they are better then don cheadle and wayans who play crip members this movie centers more on white fence and their rivalry w crips there s not too much focus on bloods in here it also more focuses on sean penn s character and robert duvall too \( good cop bad cop \) and penn on how he falls in love w a former gangmember woman in the white fence gang colors is a good watch i just wish it had more gang focus in it and more gang sets \( chapters i e eight tray gangsters hoover etc \) if you re looking for a good gang buy buy the book monster by sanyika shakur a k a monster kody scott or do or die by leon bing those 2 books far surpasses this movie,positive
i ve been a longtime fan of seagal s movies but i was greatly disappointed by this film first there were clearly sections where steven seagal s voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him \( clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming \) it was surprising that they could not take the time to get seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections there were also very few action sequences that demonstrated seagal s skills with martial arts in many ways this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film little action but lots of bloody corpses lying about i enjoyed black dawn far more and feel it was a much better made film,negative
rip it off is not an easy film to watch in short it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line leaving only the most attentive viewer \( read myself \) to guess at what was going to happen next but not in a good way judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well known and talented personalities as alyson hannigan and jennifer esposito it begs the question why did you do this film or on a personal note why did i buy this film especially at 22 and change frankly i bought it because of alyson hannigan she s gorgeous obviously intelligent and the girl can act individually speaking she does not disappoint here it s obvious that she really didn t want to sleep walk through her role as lexi and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes she is a singularly interesting actor to watch and her performance simply wants me to see her do more preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film \( see jennifer aniston in her brave performance in the good girl \) but enough gushing if ms hannigan had not been as engaged i would have trashed her soundly most everyone else in rip it off \( with the possible exception of the fellow who plays sergei with operatic relish \) is more or less phoning it in when they do their scenes this made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy also films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort beware do not adjust your screen the appearance of the film is inherently bad rip it off and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye i ve seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey and contrary to the technical description of the dvd it is presented in the horror that is full screen and not widescreen can you believe people invest money in these films \( ahem,negative
joan crawford had it star quality when i first saw her in grand hotel i was surprised how much i was watching her character instead of the equally riveting character played by the great greta garbo both were stars but crawford was able to project a different kind of sensuality than garbo a vulnerability a plucky girl next door quality in humoresque an older crawford was still able to achieve this level of performance paired off with the younger male star let s face it women have a great advantage acting \( perhaps women are always acting \) besides being better looking than men they can emote more without going out of gender role a distinct advantage vis a vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be accused of over acting it s a horrible thing to fall in love and that is just what crawford s character does falls in love with the worst of all possible choices a musician musicians only love music the music in the film is worth the price of admission alone who amongst you would throw the first stone at a fine violinist playing zigeunerwisser or any of the other fine war horses of the classical violin repertoire she falls in love with the young artist of the month whom she offers to help jumpstart his career renting a concert hall for his first recital she is married to a wealthy but understanding man who loves her but lets her do what she wants drinking philandering most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule the character of the musician does not he s a tough new yorker who gives her as good as he gets and she finds herself loving him despite herself love is madness and when he starts being successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for weeks she falls apart emotionally it is profoundly humiliating to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to keep in touch silence is the perfect expression of contempt isn t it she drinks she mopes about her cottage in the hamptons she is crazy in love with a man who doesn t seem to reciprocate her feelings in our time she might see her doc and get a prescription for zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and of obsessive thoughts of him but this is before thorazine even and she s just out of luck there so she drinks drinking was the preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love in the days before designer drugs were available from your neighborhood spice man to complicate things her musician had an old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a young man additionally there was the dreaded american mom in full armor she just had to tell this grown son of hers repeatedly that the woman he finally fell in love with was no good she even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around his ritzy new apartment with a view it seems he has too many portraits of crawford s character in view that s the way mom make your boy marry a good girl like you maybe meanwhile and i just love a line the character played by oscar levant comes up with at her cottage in the hamptons you re not the kind of woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage a lot funnier said than written levant did a lot of great piano playing in the film dropping dozens of one liners like that he almost stole several acts this is a very forties film in black and white whatever happened to the colorization process oh well finally mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her son and dutifully crawford s character retreats to her cottage in the hamptons gets drunk one last time wades into the surf in a stunning shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen again i told you love was dangerous her lover after cancelling one measly concert out of despair at her death decides not to ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage men emotional iqs of 30 at most well that s all folks if your eyes were still dry at the end of this film you re safe you ll never fall in love,positive
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie s fans live the life nowhere close to cher s and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she s supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she s like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out,negative
awhile ago i was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste such as people who love r b and rap to people who prefer dance in a way texas chainsaw massacre as well as the exorcist and the shining are like the beatles and led zeppelin of horror movies you must love them and say anything different and you re going to get lynched so i will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so called horror movies yet at the same time i wonder why it didn t hit me that much 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses they decide to check it out only no one s home seemingly at first pretty soon they meet leatherface a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw pretty soon the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive it s odd how i can t say any more about the plot not because of spoilers but because there s not a lot else to say like many a filmgoer i can t stand the latest releases in horror instead of using atmosphere pacing and mood to creep people out they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes this film isn t even gory at all in fact the film s goriest scene where one of the kids meets a chainsaw isn t even shown onscreen your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing adding to the realism is that it s shot in a kind of documentary like style one problem i had with the film was that the dread didn t feel there there was pre mtv style editing and extreme closeups of eyeballs and maybe i ve just seen it before but it didn t creep me out like it should ve \( and having a woman scream for 20 minutes doesn t help \) if i saw this in 1974 i mostly likely would ve been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later it s more like yeah it was alright although i better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it if you re a fan go ahead and buy it because it s probably the best release of the film but personally i m not,positive

well i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review truthfully i didn t catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend the trailers and the dvd cover of this movie is very misleading one would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive i m a big fan of romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take off i couldn t be more wrong nothing in the movie makes sense from the start the entire movie is over the top starting with the actors everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie she looks lost confused and out of her league other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend a wacky police sgt with his asthmatic partner the bait tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest the movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere when meteors strike the earth \( and slam into people \) it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies our main characters all meet up and try to survive however aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle the viewer is left to wonder what s going on at first but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by i honestly couldn t tell you much else because it s just so terrible that i just simply couldn t take a minute more bad acting bad dialogue over the top effects and some of the worst camera work i ve ever seen this movie apparently took two years to make imagine if they only had one another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait tackle charater he shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin s life like a bad clint eastwood impression \( with big hat covering his eyes to boot \) then he walks away when he appears again he s able to do these matrix style backflips \( digging his spurs into the wall ceiling \) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands does this guy ever miss what do you think he manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia if you dig the gore this one is ok but again wayyyy over the top i had no idea that one bullet from a 45 could blow someone in half our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3 4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head i personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter someone get nasa on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don t get it the absolutely worst part of this movie without a doubt is the music it never stops there s never a scene without music for some reason and it just makes what you re watching seem absolutely cheesy it reminded me of a 1950 s serial pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing the soundtrack is truly the worst i ve ever heard with extra cheese included did they use up their budget on the effects probably i found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film if you re a fan of good monster zombie movies i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving it doesn t make sense the story is amazingly weak the plot is well there isn t one you ll wish you could have your 2 hours back i know i do,negative

i just wanted to say this is a great workout i love the eastern dance styles i have just written a long review of honey s bollywood workout and people were saying the same things too fast etc but indian dance is taught by imitation and is very expressive facially and bodily \( especially the classical dances \) and open to improv bollywood and bhangra are an extension of classical most don t realize eastern dance is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating learning and memorizing from the beginning the teachers of the classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and movement or slow them unless they are so because you lose the inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying so have fun with this it s awesome and leaves room for your own interpretation of things as mentioned and it really wears you out plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form but i find eastern to be the most passionate feminine beautiful and divine have fun,positive

four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction loaded with drugs with paul mccartney in charge what do you get magical mystery tour with no plot great music this plays as a too long music video without purpose ok if you re a beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967 but if you weren t a beatles fan then there is no reason for this at least a hard days night with richard lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers but this too many drugs and too much ego and no direction that s all,negative
i had several friends insist that i rent this film i m glad i did instead of buying it i was not bowled over as they obviously were quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film now i m not a hard guy to make laugh but there was only one point in this film where i actually laughed out loud other than that i found sordid lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced i love southern humor and even poking fun at southerners i can t tell you how much i love greater tuna fried green tomatos steel magnolias etc but this just didn t cut it for me the cast is a who s who of excellent character actors beau bridges bonnie bedelia leslie jordan olivia newton john \( for pete s sake \) erik krieger delta burke and gobs of others no it s not a shortage of talent that this film lacks i found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once there s a scene with ty \( an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in west hollywood \) talking to his ex girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist well as a theatre director i can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them there are various filming techniques that del shores \( the director \) uses that are just hackneyed filming from behind a person s back so that only the back of one person s head and the facing person are seen why it feels like a testimonial video from mtv s real world rather than an actual film frankly and this is not always a bad thing the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film it can be a great thing look at altmans come back to the five and dime jimmy dean and you ll see how a good stage to film movie is done but this well it s just amateur hour from my perspective in all the film felt like a poor man s greater tuna \( two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in texas 3rd smallest town \) which was a stage play and was filmed for hbo as a stage play rather than attempting to make it feel like a film i wanted to like this film but i just didn t,negative

i really wish amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars this movie is nothing but anti gun propaganda i have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this but it was like watching a train wreck i just had to stay for the end you know for those of you who don t know firearms save far more innocent lives than they take every year and mine was one of them this movie cd might make a good coaster but beyond that it is trash some less than truthful nra member \( yeah right \) wrote i really liked and enjoyed this movie the acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention it will keep yours too just give it a chance sure it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry but they deserve it and need to be more responsible i may buy the dvd to watch it again but am overwhelmed with the movies i have bought from amazon com and not gotten around to watching however i may add this to my collection horse hockey member of the nra more like member of the micheal moore fan club this was the worst movie i have ever seen they even had to lie to get you in the theater as nothing was mentioned about it being anti gun in the trailers and saying that it was a little bit slanted is like saying micheal moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie,negative
ok first of all oct fri the 13th i finally saw this movie in 3d sigh i can die happy ok this one is really pretty awesome chris plays a great leading girl \( the only f 13 leadi didnt want to see with an axe in her skull \) the other characters are pretty harmless too wev e got bikers \( snort \) pothead hippies a fro d chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act plus this came out in the early 80 s so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes i give this one a high 5 cool deaths funny scenes and aside from chris s sherbert pants some decent 80 s fashion too yo debbie i want your bikini too cuuute,positive

i didn t enjoy the film i also didn t enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i don t consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what s the difference it s king lear a downer of a play there s nothing great about ran just as there s nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he s wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him why because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare s king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he s an annoyance,negative

if shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play othello he would remove heaven and earth crying out for justice be an actor in a play of shakespeare it s difficult and only the best ones can do it not mediocre actors with face of children what s martin sheen doing here he should be in better movies and in this trash if you want a good othello adaptation get the movie with kenneth brannag and laurence fishburne are good actors and a better movie,negative
this has got to be the worst film i ve ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i don t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he s sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96 but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television note s this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon and \( one of my most personal favorites \) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she s to good but why this film she \( and mila \) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this,negative

i love jeff goldblum but he didn t carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck \) and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it s obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii wasn t much better,negative

this is a review of the dvd not the world series please save your comments re the series for the sports blogs in this day and age for major league baseball to produce a non anamorphic dvd is absolutely pathetic this dvd was made for a widescreen tv \( 16 9 ratio \) but cannot take advantage of it because it is non anamorphic meaning it will not take up the full widescreen it has black bars on all four sides they may as well have made it full screen instead with a 4 3 ratio also in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the dvd out quickly they decided not to include footage from the season to show nothing of the tigers play off run and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players \( gee was it exciting to be out on the mound \) i am an avid cardinals fan but this dvd was not worth the 14 99 i paid for it major league baseball as usual cheats its fans another lesson they fail to learn from pro football,negative
quinceanera happy birthday amos lassen and literary pride one of the great mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie quinceanera a traditional rite of passage it takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood magdalena \( emily rios \) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret she is pregnant she was raised a devout catholic girl and the fact that she is with child shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her distraught by her banishment from her family magdalena turns to her uncle tomas \( chalo gonzales \) who lives with her cousin carlos \( jesse garcia \) in a small apartment in echo park los angeles carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood what results is a m nage a trios between carlos and the couple one a television producer and the other a british citizen carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes magdalena s new family unit in effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper middle class men what results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in american films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with performances are excellent in the film and the directors richard glatzner and wash westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen emily rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and chalo gonzalez as uncle tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten he is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal everything about this movie is fine the script the actors the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 sundance festival quinceanera is a marvelous film especially because it wears its queerness so well the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality maturation culture clashes and love simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed,positive

screenwriter charlie kaufman s reality bending work has become such a hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts he dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories directed by michel gondry this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception as kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one s memory at the same time gondry and kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky the labyrinth plot focuses on shy taciturn joel barish who is swept off his feet by the raucous unstable clementine much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight he discovers that clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called lacuna headed by the benevolent dr mierzwiak a renowned leader in his field of memory erasure mierzwiak treats the heartbroken joel to the same procedure as clementine s however joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of clementine the surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from joel s plight it helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued jim carrey as the depressed joel this is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate displaying no trace of her corseted britishness as the bedraggled free spirit clementine kate winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness tom wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful mierzwiak while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by kirsten dunst mark ruffalo and elijah wood all three are fine with dunst particularly affecting toward the end the looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer ellen kuras production designer dan leigh and editor valdis oskarsdottir all combining to bring much needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes the only fly in the ointment is jon brion s overly intrusive music the 2004 dvd has several extras the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by gondry and kaufman which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns there are two featurettes a standard ten minute making of short and a fifteen minute conversation with gondry and carrey that borders on banal seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included as well as a creative music video of the polyphonic spree s night and day and a faux commercial for lacuna,positive
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a 16mm print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this,negative
ok i rounded up to 4 stars this really isn t bad though it s an idiom that most american viewers won t be familiar with the major characters are kuan yin confucius and a flock of other gods godlings immortals buddhas figures from myth and other well known figures and stereotypes from the chinese pantheon there are the flying heroes improbable weapons and acting at least on a par with the dr who series in other words lots of viewers will see it as alien disconnected and amateurish as well as being filled overly convenient miracles but it s not in the western idiom so parts of it have to be taken in their own terms and it has the look of a low budget film so you won t see effects on the star wars scale and it is a bit cheesy and over the top which is part of the appeal the fights are bloodless the romance is chaste and all but the youngest kids will understand the characters if you don t take it or yourself too seriously there s a lot of fun in this one wiredweir,positive
this was a film i was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects as far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment the acting was good but robin williams did not receive as much screen time as ewen mcgreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been but the major problem was the story yes it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak boring at times and just silly i would recommend ice age or garfiled the movie rather than this film,negative
this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer,positive

a provocative and surprising thriller \( fangoria \) yeah it is surprising surprising ly bad it s also provocative it provoked me to write this bad review from the beginning i could tell the director chris fisher was attempting to create a stylistic film however after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work i gave up if you re using style have a reason style without reason is not style this film is one thing if nothing else a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots \( also known as crossdisolving shots \) drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you ll get the same effect as the camera work editing of the film there s so much overlapping shots in this film there s probably 2 1 2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is it s full of tallent bad tallent it s more about naked women sex and drugs than the actual story i expected a cheap nock off of the life of david gale i would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this this is bad annoyingly bad some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing annette davey the editor should have her name removed from the film unless for some unknown reason she s proud of her work if i was studio head at silver nitrate entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film i d have everyone and anyone associated with it fired immediately without question sony pictures home entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film if you enjoy good movies and great camera work stay away from this film,negative
this film i have to say is beautiful looking from the characters to the landscape although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects the only problem is the love between the two main characters the movie never lets you feel the love between them and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade right the main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it this film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals,positive

dare i need tell you how greatly this softcore action thriller sucks ok you might think there are two reasons \( besides those two \) to rent this nudity and hilariously bad acting well there is nudity but not as much as you think if you re getting it for anna s naked flesh be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button she s nude don t get me wrong in the shower in the bed etc but after that first scene she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene her acting is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her tv show she at least doesn t seem stoned there is a plot that involves just kidding i have no idea there are some actual actors and a travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies the movie only still exists because of anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make to the limit more than a free rental if that i should mention that this is a review for the r rated version i don t know if there is an unrated version but it would have to be better than this for more nudity bad acting and a less coherent anna go rent skyscraper,negative

this is a bad movie not only because it doesn t fit chronologically in terms of feel and content it s like this film attempts to create turtles psychaitry 101 each turtle attempts to work on and or completely vanquish their weaknesses leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children and i believe that donny falls in love it s been awhile since i ve seen this film so i may have that last thing wrong more than ten years have passed since i saw this stinker and although i don t remember every minute detail the problems that i had with it are enormous first the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci fi the television series and films haven t really gleamed upon that aspect instead relying on action humor and pseudo wisdom from splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product in my opinion the separate storylines of the turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot in particular leo s and raphael s storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in the pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments they just feel heavy handed that s not to say mikey s plotline isn t just as bad but he s allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all secondly the action is just not there as it was before sure it s still pretty bloodless but the scenes are few and far between and boring the turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it s previous effects of catharsis it felt like i was watching the history channel special about the history of the turtles war in japan and they lost also the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a warner brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too i m just the kind of guy who likes \( in these kinds of movies \) the bad guys to get a death that you don t have to see or feel the impact of because you can t imagine when their end comes like falling down a bottomless pit to me bombs are out of the question in terms of death thirdly the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny an example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following or running from bad guys and they re going up stairs lots of stairs and mikey goes this is good for my calfs i was thinking what is my mom supposed to laugh at that as for the japanese men who take to american living all too well none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now it s like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk painfully unfunny and pointless equally as pointless was the use of casey jones his character in the first movie almost steals the show at times but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the japanese men in a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines in this story the writers would have casey jones completely emasculated possibly for laughs possibly for moral the former is definitely not the case the latter is underdeveloped it s like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight that s what we re thinking for a majority of the film in retrospect the japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless so he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series i admit it s a good idea but way too heavy handed the meaning is always better in small doses finally the song used in the film toward the end with the japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting it was used to great effect in the tv spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting funny action adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film oh well at least found out the name of that song,negative
the only reason i m reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on so no let s be fair i did enjoy analyze this i really did though it wasn t a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life or even for the rest of the day and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie i didn t have very high expectations though because i rarely expect too much of sequels once again i was proven right analyze that illustrates perfectly why sequel sounds like such a dirty word the original film had a spark of originality the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again but of course that could never work it s the same problem with almost every comedic sequel those who haven t seen the original wouldn t understand the jokes and those who have already heard them before and that is why they fail time after time so what does this movie have a great comedic duo a couple of really funny guys yeah and fathers day had an even better pair look what happened to that a couple of good mafia jokes sure sure i even cracked a smile on several occasions but that isn t enough there are thousands of comedy films out there not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable and producers think they ll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas newsflash think again nobody watches these movies there s no reason to when you can just watch the original again,negative
this edition of the film sucks and sucks again the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended each shot was carefully composed \( and not intended to be butchered \) this edition is a travesty especially when it s purported to be put out by fans do you re homework there are also scenes missing from this print scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts instead its just sloppy and self indulgent look for the earlier laser disc edition as for the extras do we really need the it s great because i used it in my video slop and it s great because i did a bad homage rip off slop the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that s what was great about it then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image strikes me a total scumminess all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted by a few lazy lard asses with a quick fix mentality,negative
a french saying goes the more things change the more they stay the same it appears that the historical epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that poetic license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith s emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth firstly we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina secondly the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to purify the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is preserve the aryan race modern science using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60 000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well like it or not we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie yes this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks every single good thing about this movie would have been discovered invented with or without d w eventually and very probably very soon after every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later talented directors of the time the overall lies attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie s great hall of fame they say that racists are not born but bred this is why i m not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here his father was considered a hero of the confederate army where he served as a colonel i m sure as a bitter loser of the great war he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it s quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn s overtures over and over again in conclusion the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it s okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors world view also do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that s longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message like i said before none of the techniques that this film claims to have discovered are earth shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good d w griffith s legacy mess,negative
this was the first silent film that i saw in its entire form the 1927 king of kings directed by cecil b demille as with d w griffth charlie chaplin and greta garbo he is right up their amoung silent icons this movie starring h b warner as jesus is a truely a jewel of a film everyone knows the story but it is told very well here demille knew his bible films like ten commandments \( 1924 1956 \) samson and delilah and this movie the king of kings the film maybe dated a tiny bit but can the story of jesus be dated i love jesus movies like jesus of nazareth the greatest story ever told the 1961 king of kings and the musicals jesus christ superstar and godspell and the story of christ was also tackled in the 1916 d w griffth classic intolerence but this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail the special effects are amazing for 1927 the crucifixion scene is astondishing and a scene in color which is the resurrection scene the cast of characters is also amazing in our era of movies if you need a big scene a will have only 100 people and cgi the other tens of thousands since there was no cgi back in 1927 or computers for that matter they directors like demillie and griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics i know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old they are a gateway to the past without those groundbreaking films no one would care about movies those early silents were the catalyst for what would become i would recommend this film this movie is a true classic no matter what religion you are,positive

they say all the major characters come back in stitch the movie quickly made direct to video sequel to the hugely popular lilo and stitch for me the original film s most appealing part is and will be lilo and stitch one of the most delightful characters disney created in the last decade do we still need pleakley when we have stitch how about cobra or some alien whose name you have forgotten do we need them no i don t think so but stitch the movie crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing the original s idea of ohana or family is changed to cousin this time but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice told story no longer attractive enough what makes us feel short changed is however the lack of music and scenery the impressive parts of lilo and stitch instead of elvis songs they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and tvs like monty python and ed wood completely missing the target audiences who would buy this dvd to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer moreover the charming water color hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic unimaginative backdrop which is barely ok even by the lower standard of the disney s cheap sequels the only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters except that and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair lilo and stitch stitch the movie looks like a pilot film for the original or perhaps it is,negative

hypocrisy alert hypocrisy alert i just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start not more than twenty four hours ago i wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film i argued that fans shouldn t viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all in other words we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies now that i have gotten that out of the way i shall proceed to trash adam evil i didn t set out to heap scorn on this film when i popped it in the dvd player a few weeks ago although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and i felt my heart sinking in fact nothing screams straight to video more loudly than a film entitled adam evil well perhaps something like adam the bollweevil or even adam evil knievel might rank as likelier candidates but you get the idea adam evil does not inspire confidence that i m about to watch a slasher film on par with carpenter s halloween right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clich d slasher film hell the movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks there is seth \( kevin robson \) the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette yvonne \( erica cerra \) next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film the ever important loud guy matt \( brody harms \) along for the ride are evelyn \( barbara kottmeier \) adam himself \( sean arnfinson \) adam s girlfriend yvette \( lynsey brothers \) and a few other kids i am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the eve connotation in the three girls names and that seth is also a name pulled straight out of the old testament where matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the new testament something tells me the matthew responsible for the gospel didn t go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as matt call it a gut feeling anyway these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip drinking and romping around in the water sounds familiar doesn t it see those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision they re called red flags things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff aren t interested in helping out too a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest if you think we ll see him again before the credits roll that s one bet i won t take i should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group adam and his friend matt did something quite idiotic a few years before namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there that continues to haunt them to this day too one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful i laugh defiantly at such nonsense i won t spoil the ending for you but i will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the twist ending for a slasher film adam evil is downright puritanical with the red stuff i felt like a bizarro clara peller hollering where s the gore every time a killing went down seth for example perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless off camera fashion a couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond again a rather bloodless affair the presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things a promise unfulfilled unfortunately adam evil is one of the tamest slashers i have ever seen what did they do turn the script over to the hayes commission before shooting scenes note to aspiring filmmakers if you re going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release go over the top with the sauce at least then you ve got a shot at making a cult classic and another thing make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film sure you ll have to shell out a few more bucks but it s worth it remember unless i m laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted so bad it s good label ham handed performances can only hurt you surprisingly the dvd comes with a commentary track not that you ll want to listen to it but there it is we also get a few trailers for three other schlock films contagion hallow s end and asylum days forget about picking up a copy of adam evil it s not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf there are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention,negative
i idiotilcy got this dvd because of colin firth and as you can see it sucks btw this is not prasadjonnalagadda but rather his daughter he just comes to buy crap but never reads the reviwes anyways i had better time watching a syndicated simpsons episode than watching this bomb at first i thought that this movie might ve had some potential because of the suberb stars colin firth and minnie driver \( good will hunting won an oscar for it \) i did not yet know heather grahm but after this movie i hate her now i will admit she was alright up until she got drunk in the car that was annying beyond reason other than that the film s set up is absolutly horrible starting off with colin coming to a town just because it s called hope and falling in love with someone only after a couple of days and there is also the horrible music that doesn t fit the mood at all whenever they play at the scene pepole i originnaly gave this a 2 star for colin and minnie but heather is responsible for everything else,negative
i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed,negative

this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it what a waste,negative

like stuart gordon s other venture into science fiction territory the underrated and ill fated robot jox this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience everyone joins in the fun in this one with dennis hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog debi mazar and stephen dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and charles dance having the time of his life with his horny half metal madman this excellent dvd offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the director,positive
there are plenty of anti bush films and books around if you only shall see or read one this must be the best pick i like michael moore very much but he is not really a political heavyweighter and i don t think fahrenheit 9 11 is his best work it does not mix humour and political insight as well as the book stupid white men for instance it is more like two or three movies in one william karel is a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary but what a documentary it has turned out to be very disturbing insights from informed sources among them former cia agents it is not usual to hear such plain speaking from people in high places just a few years after the events this film is perhaps not as entertaining as fahrenheit 9 11 but far more informative,positive

if you follow my reviews you know that i felt the version of jack the ripper with michael caine as inspector fred abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece not only was michael caine phenomenal in the role but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we don t know and never will while i respect this version with johnny depp it is more horror oriented \( michael caine s version was more historical \) onto the subject at hand some of you may know jack s 5 victims \( mary anne nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride kathy eadows and mary jane kelly \) well they seem to have a close friendship and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret \( in the michael caine version the 5 victims knew each other but they were just associates \) well of course jack the ripper comes into play one scene is very well done in that while we don t see his face we do see some disturbing pictures and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine in comes depp \( inspector fred abberline \) it is interesting that while the older michael caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role johnny depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday but maybe depp didn t want to just imitate caine one thing i had a problem with was that while caine had some trouble with his superiors depp s trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion \( without giving the story away his superiors must have known things that they didn t tell depp at least caine s superiors carried some reason on their side \) you ll probably notice that depp finds things out much quicker than caine did \( probably because caine s version was 4 hours while depp s is only 2 \) while caine was involved with an artist depp becomes involved with mary jane kelly gradually depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle like caine did in his version depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer \( of course depp does not know he is talking to the killer \) well another problem here is that in the caine version we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with caine we never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to depp \( jack the ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the caine version \) i will admit that the scenery is well done the elements of horror are there and depp did a good job of not just imitating michael caine and depp s sergeant godley does offer some entertainment but if you saw the michael caine version you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy if on the other hand you don t mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history you ll probably find it a respectable horror movie side note johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he s going to die anyday well in reality fred abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped jack the ripper,positive
this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year old who aspires to be a mass murderer there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino s kill bill films his salute to the genre or reservoir dogs which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence bullet is little more than two hours of broken glass fire blood squirts amputation beatings and explosions this makes gladiator look like a sunday school picnic the characters are totally flat one dimensional there is virtually no plot aside from excuses generated to wreak havoc the acting is weak static despite the fact that i don t understand a word of cantonese we are presented with a series of stereotypes \( the hooker with a heart of gold the good friend the crazy friend and the bad friend \) unfortunately the american stereotype of the viet cong as madmen and saigon as hopelessly corrupt is reiterated here to the detriment of any understanding of viet nam during the american occupation the worst thing is that because they are so shallow and undeveloped you don t care what happens to the characters so i ll tell you and then you won t have to finish watching the film they kill each other my advice skip it,negative

jean renoir s masterpiece the grand illusion is truly a film about humanity it is a universal theme something we can all understand and relate to the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler s imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history nevertheless jean renoir s poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb jean gabin is one of the all time great actors jean renoir s innovative approach would influence countless directors to come including orson welles criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd also worth getting is the rules of the game jean renoir s greatest satire,positive

richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout \( along with partner emilio estevez \) of pretty madeleine stowe \( they have to watch her house through the night \) and he falls in love with her before the movie is over there s a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer \( aidan quinn \) it s pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie but the script is above average especially the dialogue and dreyfuss s performance is right on target a very entertaining movie definitely worth a watch,positive
the changeling has become a little bit dated however it is still a very good ghost story the film stars \( george c scott \) as john russell a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident he rents a large estate in order to compose his music it is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy why is the boy haunting the estate why is he making contact with john russell as the film moves forward john russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion from what he can gather it was the former home of senator carmichael \( melvin douglas \) what ensues is the mystery of who the child is and who is senator carmichael what occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there this is more of a mystery than a horror film the suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy s wheelchair moves the film is dated and does not have the appeal it once had for me however it is still a good watch recommended,positive
to start i am a very big fan of doris day for yeays i had just bought the 6 dvd box set of her movies loved that so i decided to buy this tv series it is so awful words can t describe it it s not because it s dated because i love lucy is alot older sheer perfection it s initially nice to see doris in another genre but this first series just doesn t work for me for many reasons the subject matters chosen are thoughtful \( that s the reason i gave it two stars the presence of doris \) i ll tell you the show just bored me i found myself fast forworded through the last 10 episodes the dvd extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting there s no new interviews with doris \( that s an old interview they put on there \) i think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dog,negative
just today i randomly selected a movie that movie was henry i had never heard of it before and i figured that i was in for your average run of the mill low budget slasher flick though it is low budget it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie in fact the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study meet henry a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition watch as he goes to work watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people this film does not exploit the violence though it is very frank and direct treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park this movie is a lot of things and when it was all over i just had to sit back and take a few breaths have a cigarette and try to gauge my reaction \( s \) i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing it is also pretty funny in some parts though only funny in the blackest sense of the term there is no social commentary in this movie nor does it provide any closure the dvd is great awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas awaiting lethal injection on death row very fascinating,positive
cast denzel washington john goodman donald sutherland embeth davidtz james gandolfini elias koteas gabriel casseus michael j pagan running time 123 minutes rated r for violence and language fallen starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese \( elias koteas \) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes \( denzel washington \) looks on hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich \( glen witko \) in a bathtub having been poisoned the same way reese used to kill his victims at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta \( embeth davidtz \) who at first is reluctant to speak with him things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich charles \( robert joy \) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes ruining his life career setting him up for murder getting to his friends family hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him everyone he cares about charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character donald sutherland doesn t prove to have any range doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under rated actress she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future the directing and camera work in this movie was superb it was done in such a way where you can see azazel s spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town although this film does require your full attention it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours fallen is an intelligently written supremely efficiently executed and one of the most unheralded unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade one of the better of its kind,positive
this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great including a phenomenal cast lead by cate blanchett and great scenery and cinematography the actors playing elizabeth cecil and walsingham spoke and acted admirably each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling but the words themselves rendered the performances useless the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material they should have read elizabeth the first s biography by elizabeth jenkins it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain had the author and director been more historically accurate they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth who is in turn hysterical defeatist overbearing childish tyrannical who never shows her core intelligence her great love of her people who had a private core described by her motto semper eadem be always one elizabeth ruled with her advisors she was not totally ruled by them she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table nor would burleigh have allowed it cate blanchett s wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity much less truth how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna i suggest that he should have first read some english history,negative

francisco was right this film is about as well conceived as buttcrust the review on the back of the dvd says jaw dropping but the full quote probably reads jaw dropping \( because i was lulled to sleep like a baby \) there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage in the zombie attack scenes but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie the rest of this film consists of the ear bleeding whines and yawn inducing infighting of the human characters ill conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo cynical and extremely redundant evil side of human nature message that would be better left to jean renoir \( or even adam sandler considering the results here \) i don t watch zombie movies for the characters especially characters so vapid and unengaging it seemed like the script writer read a novice s how to pamphlet and said yeah it needs some conflict if these characters weren t so constipated and bloated i d give them a chance one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of social commentary but that s just a mindless knee jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully it wasn t you d get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass the critical ambitions of this movie are ill fitting and embarassing and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director s real talent which is \( you guessed it \) the lovely undead the rest is monotonous dreck i don t know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man s dramatic rags all that aside the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop out in the history of horror movies a horror movie that sucks for 3 4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself but the cut away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads sorry but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite repeating moron,negative
don t buy the directors cut badder santa is absolutely hysterical for some strange reason the director decided to make a director s cut that is a neutered version of badder santa i bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from billy bob in the first scene was missing the celebration in the bar after the first mall heist where billy bob proclaims he s giving up drinking was missing the next scene where billy bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing that was enough for me i immediately shut it off and best buy agreed to let me swap it for badder santa due to the false impression of a longer and fuller cut than it s predecessor as is the industry standard i was duped please buy badder santa instead this is a watered down walmart version of a classic not an extended cut,negative

this movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90 s and probably my favorite plot twister who done it along with m night shamylans films this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress neve campbell and denise richards who are both perfect for they re rolls the whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable which is unexpected from john mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from csi the 2 girls have it in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich i was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet matt dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool i do miss neve campbell i wish she d come back to films and it looks like she will so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99 9 of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole it thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of cool form that shoot well i did anyway,positive
weird whacked out interpretation of lewis carroll s alice in wonderland that combines live action with some stop action animation to create a creeped out dreamscape white rabbit is a sawdust stuffed real rabbit that escaped from the taxidermy stand caterpillar is an old stocking with dentures and glass eyes mad hatter is a marionette and march hare is a wind up stuffed toy rabbit with a loose button eye devoted alice fans may have a different reaction but i found jan svankmajer s alice disturbing and at times tedious everyday objects the stuff in alice s room become the stuff of the dream playing cards become red queen and entourage the white rabbit has a nasty looking set of incisors and a distressing tendency to shed his sawdust guts alice herself becomes her own blank faced doll there s no law that says alice has to be bright and cuddly but it sure helps whether intentional or not svankmajer s alice is grim and nightmarish svankmajer animates figures in motion real figures like dolls and stuffed and mounted rabbits and such but he doesn t animate facial expressions combine that with the flat tone of voice by the film s narrator alice is narrated by the actress who plays alice dubbed into english or course and the film has a flat dead feeling the film oddly enough for an animated feature is leadenly paced some scenes seem to run on forever the tea party with the mad hatter \( a marionette \) and the march hare \( a bedraggled plush toy bunny with an annoyingly ill attached button eye \) runs on and on the animation repeating itself way past our limit of patience the mad hatter wants a new cup of tea \( change chairs \) the march hare scoots around in a wheelchair the new seats are taken the tea is poured the mad hatter wants a news cup of tea \( change chair \) and on and on and on sheesh thought that scene would never end look i m not that big a fan of carroll s alice stories in the first place but the movie adaptations of his stories be they disney s animated movie or the 1933 full length feature with ned sparks as the catepillar and sterling holloway as the frog all have had something going for them comedy for one thing svankmajer s inspiration is laudable but his execution is often disappointing his alice is dark grim humorless and not everyone s cup of chai it s like listening to a quiet sonata played by an acid jazz band it s familiar enough probably good enough for the converted but hard for the uninitiated to embrace and unlikely to win any new fans,negative

i waited over 30 years to see this film and now that i have i m glad i waited that long its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago nicholas alexandra their daughters their son the people surrounding them not only are they not fictional but thanks to the era in which they lived they were photographed we know what they actually looked like so who on earth did the casting it was impossible to tell one grand duchess from another and as for alexandra in the first few scenes i had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag janet suzman was the worst casting flub of all unless you count the stilted manner in which michael jayston delivered his lines what a stiff and boring character he makes nicholas to be yet there are photos extant of nicholas smiling as he played with his children nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as tsar but in the robert massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled it was very clear that nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the russian people as well as to his family and above all his son the future tsar there was nothing exceptional about his behavior most of europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens and to all of them the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable yet this film falls into the trap most of us do of judging history not on the basis of its own terms but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20 20 hindsight having been fed soviet propaganda for 75 years we have it entrenched in our minds that nicholas was an extremely poor ruler that s the stunning success of the massie book that someone who had absolutely no connection to russians and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia was able to overcome the general \( and erroneous \) knowledge of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking the movie on the other hand makes nicholas look petty and alexandra slightly over the edge one petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to nicholas s sending off his troops into world war i it was badly researched to the point of ludicrousness the tsars of russia were all orthodox christians orthodox christianity has its own very distinctive music in fact russian orthodox chant is very different from greek orthodox chant so what kind of background music did the director choose gregorian of course can we at least strive for a little authenticity apparently not massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the romanovs towards their captors how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the bolsheviks you aren t anything like what we thought was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject the movie showed nothing of that well in the end it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the romanov family canonized in the russian orthodox church that movement was well underway by 1971 i wonder if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures all in all purchasing the movie was a waste of money maybe the bolsheviks over at the university s russian department will appreciate my donating it that way others can get to see it without wasting their money,negative
spoiler alert the ending of this 118 minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion the bored billionaire did it however he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very very hot pierce brosnan the billionaire still sexist from his stint as james bond enjoys playing with the lady renee russo and she as the tough but sexy catherine olds banning loses her heart to him as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed in the process she shows some very appealing nipples the 1968 version of which this is a remake starred steve mcqueen and faye dunaway in this version to the socially irresponsible self absorbed 90s are ever present we don t mind not having the suspense we just yearn to see brosnan and russo get it on dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible brosnan as thomas crown is bored but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman for as long as he is interested in her for thrills he steals priceless works of art from publicly funded museums the film makes it clear he can do so under the noses of security guards police and hundreds of innocent art lovers russo s insurance company insured the painting so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable but impossible to fence monet and save her employer a bundle what we have here is a film with clever dialog rich and exotic sets and loads of sexual tension one wonders now after enron worldcom tyco and other corporate heists just whom brosnan is cheating in order to support his high tech heist brigade how many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this he never really you know works but i digress dennis leary has a character role as the streetwise new york detective who advises russo s banning as we watch her slowly spiral out of control risking her job and her reputation we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether russo will fall for him or brosnan duh the film moves back and forth from caper to cover up this can be confusing but who cares all we have to do is wait for their next move the next gorgeous set the next revealing love scene the thomas crown affair will keep both men and women interested for all the usual reasons it is a film worth watching and a great date flick,positive

this is my second favorite john woo movie with great touches of action and drama when i first saw this film \( about 5 years ago \) i wasn t used to seeing this much violence on screen \( and i thought lethal weapon was extremely violent at that time \) i was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped this film is very violent but compared to other action films this is really tame nowadays the minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots some weird cuts and editing the subs were terrible as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad but this is john woo s first \( if you can count heroes shed no tears \) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse much worse yun fat chow ti lung and leslie chung have their good moments to bad moments most of the good moments goes to chow and ti while leslie had only one or two moments the plot is like this a cop must confront his criminal brother that s it if your the typical hollywood action goer this is your perfect find but as i said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don t make this your first one i ll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on but if your the hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on this film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre i really recommend this film to any action fan,positive
although many reviewers didn t like the second part of the hills i still wouldn t call it one of the worst sequels ever or the worst wes craven film certainly this is not a masterpiece even in the framework of horror genre but i don t see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick when i was watching it i came to a conclusion early wes craven had been imitating other directors rather often i m not saying he was not original at all eventually he shot a nightmare on elm street in 1984 but the hills have eyes were reminiscent of texas chainsaw massacre and in the beginning of 80s when slasher era started i guess craven decided to make something in the same manner maybe the reason was craven s long time buddy sean cunningham created friday the 13th in 1980 and wes was envious \) anyway the second part of the hills have eyes turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time and it obviously wasn t the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned friday the 13th the score was written by harry manfredini known to every friday fan and the music in hills 2 is just like in early fridays the body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie kevin blair who had a leading male part here would star in friday the 13th part vii a couple of years later along with kane hodder who did stunts for the hills have eyes 2 and in friday would play you know whom of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies \( like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together all the big strong guys get killed and a handicapped girl survives i m not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning especially if you ve seen a couple of horror films in your life \) but is that a problem for a true horror fan we ve learned not to take this trivia into account so i think the hills have eyes 2 managed on many levels and it would be interesting to have it in your collection if you have the first one for they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror,positive
backbeat is an excellent portrayal of the hamburg phase of the early beatles and succeeds on every level although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of fifth beatle stuart sutcliffe the focus quickly shifts to john lennon who \( as in real life \) dominated the music and lives of the early beatles it is as much the story of stu and john as the story of stu and astrid and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships still it is a fascinating look at the early beatles who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough reeperbahn bars in the pre fame years the cast is excellent and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed the music is also excellent and complements the story perfectly in all backbeat is an entertaining journey through the world of the early beatles and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings,positive

terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger it covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma they have their differences yet the love between them is always so obvious it s also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other even their sex lives i ve seen this movie several times and everytime i cry at the end in spite of the death the movie ends on a positive note giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor \( also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson \) creates a plot within a plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her when she has been cheating on him as well somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover \( played by the very talented john lithgow \) we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn t seem wrong if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut wrenching at the same time this is a perfect choice,positive
i ll start out by saying that i prefer the jason movies i think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie the freddy movies are good horror movies but they re not really slashers like i thought they would be a nightmare on elm street a great classic horror movie by wes craven he creates good high school characters although trying to prove that they re only 15 years old is a little far fetched freddy is more horrific and scary he doesn t say much a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy s revenge they were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of freddy in this sequel many will disagree but i don t think it s a bad movie it s just very dark and horrific a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors definately a step up from part 2 it goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back nancy who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital the style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives a nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master decent entry in the series carrying over characters from 3 and introducing all new characters the story doesn t flow as easily this time around and it s a step down from part 3 but still good a nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child stephen hopkins visual style makes this the best sequel in the series freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great the story is more interesting than part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good freddy s dead the final nightmare cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an american town rachel talalay thinks the 3 d effects in the film are lame but not that story element if it weren t for the interesting backstory on freddy this wouldn t be a good movie wes craven s new nightare wes craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies nightmare encyclopedia alot of interviews that aren t edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk it s good to see that these interview aren t self serving at all and they re completely retrospective it would ve been nice to hear more from heather langenkamp or possibly johnny depp this is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans i m a huge fan of the alien series and a pretty big fan of the predator series but not as much as alien i would say that i m now a huge fan of jason and a good sized fan of freddy in comparison to alien predator i do recommend these movies but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today,positive

i was like the previous reviewer i had rented it and after watching it the first time purchased it before i had even returned the rental i loved the content it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience how lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine waiting to be returned to and i didn t learn this fact from the video i have been studying this subject for many years and already believe no i know that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on earth this video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true home people who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come my own mother saw her mother as she died she came to take her home there is no specific religion addressed here only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying and that it is something to be totally unafraid of in fact physical death is only the beginning of something great it is a step in the evolution of our souls,positive

if there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was history of violence on critics top ten list everyone was talking about the performances of viggo and maria and ed so i went into it with high expectations honestly it wasn t horrible but it wasn t worth all the worship that the hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either the story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of ed harris who in my opinion had the best performance overall ed \( mr fogarty \) is in the mob and seems to think that viggo \( tom \) is joey cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge tom and his wife edie \( played by maria bello \) have two children a farmhouse and a diner and tom insist that he isn t joey the story goes on dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex maria bello has never been one of my favorite actresses i think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair \( evidence is in the movie \) she brings the level of believability down and makes viggo s performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent we soon figure out that tom is indeed joey and after we say goodbye to ed harris s character \( of which i was just disappointed to see c mon he was awesome \) tom joey goes to see his brother richie \( william hurt \) to make amends for disappearing and soon realizes that richie wants him dead so more killing more blood and tom joey is finally free of his past if his family would take him back of course they do really his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table \( his daughter sets a place for him \) and the movie is over there was no aha moment the action wasn t anything new the story was predictable and the setting was been there done that viggo is an amazing actor and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the tom joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into the shift of reality was barely noticeable maria bello needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough sexy stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly it doesn t work for her she cannot pull it off so i don t recommend this movie its slow its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be,negative
with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance yet doesn t stray too far from what he knows best there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers patton oswalt appears in a blink and you ll miss him scene but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who s roles are a lot more important than the characters they play bates is great as mcconaughey s mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker s flatmate parker should stick to television she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie a good date movie flick the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained special features are nothing too special a trailer and a few dodgy featurette s a rainy night rental movie,negative

bulworth is ostensibly warren beatty s brave political satire in which a conservative senator suddenly starts liberally voicing those opinions that the rest of us are supposed to be thinking but are afraid to say he tells a black church congregation to put away the malt liquor and fried chicken and stop supporting running backs that stab their wives if that s what you were thinking you ll love this movie otherwise bulworth is jaw droppingly bad to take such a hight position as to attack beatty for suggesting that black characters need a white powerbroking partriarch to come to his senses before their concerns can be publicly considered is to give bulworth way more credit than it deserves it s distinguished from movies that are simply bad through its inclusion on the short list of truly dangerous ones not content to be racism hiding in plain site bulworth s racism is disguised as its own solution drug dealers have their transactions justified as the only commercial avenue open to otherwise well intended african american youths nina \( halle berry \) articulates an informed point and it s a joke because attractive young black women look funny when they talk smart like high grammar versions of zip coon in so doing beatty reminds black americans that no matter what they accomplish we know who they really are however limited the potential of the opening premise \( bulworth plans his own assassination for insurance purposes before inevitably changing his mind \) the film never approaches the kind of farley brotheresque world that would have been its natural destination the sincerity of the politician s catharsis is hidden from us both because his new outlook is originally motivated only by the insurance scam and because once beatty starts rapping his lines he never stops making the actor \( as opposed to the character \) look uncomfortable for the duration that this movie lured audiences and critics into its didactic spell is astonishing the film s ambition to be more than a cute little movie while being exactly the opposite reminds this reviewer of roberto benigni s embarrassing life is beautiful from the year before both have to be seen to be believed,negative
i watched parts of all the let s dance salsa dvds and what a joke is this guy serious he needs to get a few dvds himself to find out about salsa rhythm lead and following and just general concepts of dancing i agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews what qualifies him as an instructor i think he s doing an injustice to salsa if anyone is considering learning from these dvds don t you ll not only learn some bad habits in dancing but you ll be a joke on the dance floor the only worth these dvds have to anyone interested in salsa is for a good laugh seriously amazon should consider removing this product,negative

this has a run down of the colts season from game one to the super bowl thats it do not expect the super bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is very disappointing the afc championship game of the week is just a post game show i would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game it was better then the super bowl the only good things where the few extras with manning and harrison wired for sound i hope there is a better one come n cause this is not worth much,negative
i watched this with some trepidation and i have to say it was both better and worse than i thought it would be it was better because it remained fairly true to the original in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending it was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original and i found stone s lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting a couple of things kept me viewing this dvd one was the london setting which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns the other was sharon stone s rather plucky performance and the presence of charlotte rampling who has aged into a different kind of beauty morrisey doesn t even come close to filling michael douglas s shoes and it s hard to feel sorry for him at the end as with the first movie you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made the basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one however both movies were quick to abandon hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex there s nothing wrong with either of these things but here they just get in the way,negative
23 for the chinese version and the english subtitles are mad the english subtitles available on american cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable i don t regret this purchase because i think drama sets should be 25 tops and the camera is so clear on this dvd compared to what is seen on american cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are it made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for me when i didn t really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable so what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series i don t get the appeal of this show at all i thought it was really slow my favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise i felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk breath in breathe out and ponder ponder i think the phenomenon of the show s popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring just thinking about this show strips another layer of elasticity from my heart it s so boring p s this drama got a 20 rating domestically but sam soon and jang geum scored 50 hahaha,negative
a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity as a big fan of greer garson i must comment on jane bedinger s review in which she claimed that ms garson was having an affair with the actor who played her son ms garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made i don t see how ms bedinger could consider this an affair,positive
i first saw this movie on tv as a college student i loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on vhs tape i have watched this movie so many times i m surprised the vhs tape is still working the actors are perfectly cast in the leads they are so believeable in their portrayals that i could have gone to high school with them the kissing scene is hot clothes don t need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene the characters are not glossy and that is what i love about john hughes he portrays coming of age in all its naked and truest glory not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years if you re looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack this is your type of movie,positive
while i thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies all have their funny moments i still enjoy the first the best mainly because the jokes were original and fresh though it is still funny to see the strange things jim would get himself into levy as his father was a great choice this is worth the 20 dollars easy lots of laughs and plenty of gross out humor,positive

i have always had a morbid fascination with that segment of the population that believes that the bible is the only book one has to read and that great literature consists entirely of the left behind series i bought this movie to get a sense of this group banal is the kindest word i can find for this tripe third rate actors low rent science fiction backdrops and completely out of touch with reality the movie opens with the israeli agricultural miracle what it does not tell the audience is that israel would be a dead state if it were not for the 20 of the israeli government s budget funded by us taxpayers through the us government s very unwise investment in this apartheid regime \( see jimmy carter s new book \) and if it were not for the blatant israeli underground pipes that are literally looting the arab aquifers at long range and from way beneath the earth israeli agriculture is not a miracle it is a travesty it consumes 50 of all the water used in israel and produces less than 5 of the gross domestic product the movie goes downhill from there just to place it in a proper religous movie context if the ten commandments was a perfect 10 this movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a 2,negative
im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz,negative
despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever a goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer this writer did moonstruck but this is moonstink seeing rod steiger with this material is a tragedy the case is a joke the characters are impossibly lame and the dialogue would gag a collie this film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters no amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the bankok privey i just watched this film and at the conclusion i just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was saradon keitel kline steiger and rickman will try and forget this dog their entire lives i cannot imagaine how any studio or distributing company let this turkey reach the public have i gotten the point accross that the film is weak i hope so if i could give it zero stars or even better minus eleven stars i would,negative

i saw this movie twice the second time knowing exactly why i wanted to see it again if you are trying to find out if you love someone or not make sure that you see this movie such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives explains why we are where we are and makes you part of the harmony is love as simple as teaching someone to bike think about it if there are no rules against it this film should be renominated for oscar,positive
i m going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie i have seen plenty of russian films and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component mikhalkov for example is a director who can do this this movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson although the acting isn t necessarily bad you don t get attached to the characters i got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn t match the movie s theme and plot at times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching even though i never do that anyway i do not recommend this movie if you want to watch some good russian movies go with brother burnt by the sun prisoner of the mountains war or unfinished piece for the mechanical piano,negative

as the other reviewers make clear this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ruined her so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation problem is having just watched the movie i am not convinced there is anything below the surface prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy \( as fantasy it is \) is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility not that i can see,negative

a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there s no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it s a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film doesn t have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they ll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them,positive

i saw this movie for one reason i wanted to see gerard butler in something other than phantom of the opera just to see how he played a normal role i ve never been a big fan of chick flicks \( for instance my friend and i watched a walk to remember awhile ago and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room \) that said dear frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored initially i had trouble understanding what the actors were saying \( they all have thick accents \) but once i got used to it i had no problems through the rest of the movie,positive
this movie made no sense to me whatsoever it wasn t really funny and it wasn t scary the only thing that i got was that he killed zombies or returners as he called theme and was upssed with one i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot but that was the only good thing in the film it was also boring but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you,negative

i don t own a copy of the original cut and it s been a while since i ve seen the original cut a short review of this version is as follows the film print is flawless in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70 s or 80 s on purpose the blue filter is gone so it doesn t look slick and shiny this film is dark rich and grungy very noir ish and warm obviously the running gag through out the first film was that porter wants his 70k back not 130k or 1 million just 70k this was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it the first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again porter in this film is not charming or smooth he s smart violent and cold a true anti hero the annoying voice over narration is gone there are several new characters and several new brutal kills minus the credits this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes this is a great companion piece to the great to live and die in l a it got the same mood i told you this review was going to be short,positive
the depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned from the moment they reached king kong s island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience i felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape how can anyone feel anything for king kong he keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island forces them to provide him sacrificial women and tortures the female star of the movie it seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking king kong the villains of the movie were my heroes i kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end,negative

while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times the genius of david bowie shines through as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust it was an amazing look at the time period the sound quality is suprisingly good although some camera angles are distracting at times it was also neat to hear bowie s pronouncement of this is our last tour ever little did he know this dvd is worth every penny rock on,positive
so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995 this movie and mira sorvino s performance in it was so bad that after it was over i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category let s see according to wikipedia they were kathleen quinlin \( apollo 13 a fairly standard worried wife of astronaut in danger role \) mare winningham \( georgia did not see this one \) joan allen \( nixon did not see but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon \) and kate winslet \( sense and sensibilities did not see either but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also \) it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today s hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance and i was beginning to warm up to her too she was great in romy and michele s high school reunion and terrific also in beautiful girls so what exactly is so bad about this movie here s a brief list 1 mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard maybe in 1995 because she was new the academy didn t realize that this wasn t her real voice and took pity on her 2 stupid plot device of the greek chorus 3 stupid happy ending with a twist 4 lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies while this movie is not itself a porn flick the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch 5 odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen \( with dyed hair and bald spot \) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters all right so i m just jealous woody still looks gross 6 cliched poorly developed characters a plotline that goes around in circles and lots and lots of pointless unfunny dialogue in summary this movie is bad bad bad,negative
this dvd version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable hayley mills is her usual irrepressible self and the supporting cast is top notch the feline actor in particular \) i don t quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format it didn t bother me at all disappointment i could understand but this kind of vitriol it s still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages and i found it a refreshing change from the dumbed down kid s movies they tend to make these days adults will enjoy the suspenseful story retro style and feline antics just as much as kids will i d skip the remake and get the original,positive
maybe it s just me but i really don t see the appeal of this movie it s an incredibly small production \( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film \) with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest either \( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie \) if you are an alan rickman fan chances are you ve already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these don t let the promise of a nude scene convince you to buy this movie honestly alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very dialogue heavy film and the dialogue is not well written enough to carry it off,negative
if you re looking to hear robert johnson s songs you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible as this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years i m not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs and talk about his life that s all we have now and of course the covers do not outdo him that would be impossible but there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of robert johnson and the world he lived in the discussion with a former classmate is touching and the covers of his songs by those who knew him \( robert lockwood jr honeyboy edwards \) and by some of the new delta blues talent such as guy davis roy rogers and especially alvin youngblood heart blew me away gov t mule and sonny landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work the major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n roll hall of fame gathering and also bob weir s performance which is just plain bad all in all it is a good film and it s nice to actually be able to watch people play his music as we will never be able to see the real thing,positive

obviously the music featured here is of high quality hardly sign of the times transcendent but nonetheless very exciting \( as was typical of prince s 2002 tour \) unfortunately the director does his her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound hamfisted camera angle switches bizarre washed out colors some horribly cheesy effects and cuts for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity it s a shame the director clearly hasn t the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber hey prince just so you know your diy npgmc approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you d been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you if it looks this amateurish then you just look well amateurish and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur level presentation the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this i mean really you re shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam antwerp footage was not up to par i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this hardcore prince fans such as myself will want it despite this but casual fans \( especially those not familiar with the more obscure prince material that makes up most of this concert \) should definitely avoid,negative
a great ending to a great series it left me craving more not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful plus mugen and jin s final \( for the time being \) battle was great leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle it was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie,positive

overall this is an extremely awesome concert i am a big fan of dt and like pretty much all their stuff the performance itself is pretty good although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and jordan s keyboard solo other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album if they had done more special things it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4 other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance but would say they did okay as far as that goes sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them the special features are also pretty good but i would not buy this concert just for those backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves overall i did think it was pretty cool and i would recommend buying it if you like dream theater or just their genre of music in general,positive
i agree with the negative comments i eventually stopped watching it unconvincing acting \( and a small point that i found irritating in tv movies about war some of them have a too clean look that make a film seem unrealistic there is no dirt anywhere as far as i could see everybody looks too clean the settings look too clean and not realistic the acting level was what finally turned me off glad it was on tv,negative
release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own it will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have you also get to find out who dirty is or whatever pete says things about him in a couple of places \( online \) and all i could think is who is that so thats also very exciting i would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this remember its the stuff deemed unfit for my heart with always be the b side to my tongue,positive
we started with there goes a dump truck which actually features a different dave this first dave was in the dumptruck tractor and farm truck versions maybe a few others and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is the newer dave \( dave hood \) is in all the rest \( along with his sidekick becky in some \) and is much less goofy than the other dave i don t think the kids really care though the sillier the better and my son loves them both anyway i started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the tv i don t let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall tv to things that are at least somewhat informative educational as a result he was never one to sit and watch much tv \( made it hard for me to get things done \) but with this series he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles \( and some of the more goofy moments \) so much it really was a lifesaver at times needless to say it didn t take long for me to collect the entire series i have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations my in laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the tractor and farm truck versions with him his favorites include there goes a firetruck there goes a monster truck and there goes a spaceship but he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus i can t say enough good things about the video series as far as my son s enjoyment goes just don t look for any oscars for the acting and editing it s pretty choppy even for an amateur eye i would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle,positive

haven t we all been there wishing we could be better than someone else wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight this is exactly how the movie cheaters affected me i found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this the plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question what would i do in this situation jeff daniels and jena malone give such incredible performances in this movie i believe that they are very convincing if you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie cheaters is the true direction for you to head in,positive

i would often rush to see all arnold schwarzenegger films i adore his bad acting it must be the muscles i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch i can t believe how terrible an actor this man was is and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap wow talk about the american dream i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time trend maybe the era but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no no for me this movie had it s moments for a 8 year old maybe for an adult you have to have a strong stomach you i would never say this about bruce willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh i couldn t care less do with this what you will i won t recommend it later folks,negative
the quiet earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below this movie is not the epic thought provoking intelligent sci fi i was led to believe it was it s actually very overrated and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or primer will likely be very disappointed the first 30 minutes or so are jaw dropping i was really getting geared up for what i was sure was going to become one of my all time favorites the scenes of bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet driving around a mall the sun rising to the haunting score all unforgettable the scenes where bruno starts to lose it running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he s their ruler giving them speeches \( that s why i deserve to be president of the quiet earth i ve been condemned to live \) are all great after this point the movie starts to disintegrate and quickly the female character is highly irritating so much so that i think i would have ditched her and looked for other survivors api is also highly irritating and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle my thumbs were pointing down way down something needs to be said about the ending of this film so many people have said that it s deep how is it deep how is it deep when it s just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really doesn t have anything to say let s examine this many people argue the following \( and if they were correct the film would ve been much better than it was \) the main character is a scientist who convinces himself that project flashlight resulted in the effect \( even though others here insist on calling it the event \) which made everyone else disappear the main characters come to believe that the effect didn t snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened but what if there isn t any effect at all what if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there aren t any people the scientist then convinces himself that the effect is going to happen again and understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers daffy annoying woman and a nutty homicidal maniac decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for project flashlight he dies again and ends up on another world one which this time doesn t even resemble earth the end it would have been very clever if this was what was going on if there really wasn t an effect at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died unfortunately all the critics saying they went to another earth where everyone else was gone are forgetting something the dead bodies i know there aren t a lot but remember there s the radiation burn guy in the science station and there s the dead guy on the hood of his car and the dead woman holding a cb radio etc if they went to another earth where life was absent why are there dead people the real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out that it doesn t make sense and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive according to the people who worked on the film the effect obviously did occur and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies again at the exact moment that the effect occurs a second time so at the end the effect does occur a second time which means the girl and api are history and the scientist as he again dies when the effect occurs moves on one more time another point that is made in the dvd commentary is that the film was made by a catholic so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind also highly irritating is that for a scientist the main character is not very smart he laments that he s the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman they find a nutty guy named api and then the three of them conclude they re the last three people on earth what are they totally daft a scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city more people than that throughout the rest of new zealand and even more people in bigger places such as america europe and asia that his first conclusion is always that they re the only ones only demonstrates his stupidity they come to believe that they all died at the same time right when the effect occurred and that that s why they remained on earth well if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny new zealand then many many other people must ve died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world,negative
i loved the first one and i think with the logic and plot of the first one this follows through we knew they changed the world and in this sequel we see that the actors do a good since the lead characters are suppose to be let s say less intelligent but nice i think this movie and the 1st one are classics i like the grim reaper his atitude during the movie and the fact the he is the comic relief \( okay so most of the movie is comic relief \) even if they are fun to watch to laugh at it is worth it to watch,positive
this movie is full of memorable scenes although it s probably been more than a decade since i last saw it it s suspenseful without being gory the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood and even though i d read the book and knew the outcome i was on the edge of my seat right to the finish,positive
for better or worse after the relative box office slump of on her majesty s secret service producers brocolli and saltzman decided to woo sean connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum connery who had said he would never do another bond film donated all of his money to his own foundation while his performance is competent and smooth as ever he seems all business no longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant connery mechanically works his way through diamonds are forever an outright bore of the bond series and in my opinion one of the worst \( certainly connery s worst \) while some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the bond genre it plainly isn t it was an attempt to return bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers far from trying to lampoon the bond formula the producers were trying to resuscitate it and they failed after the opening gun barrel sequence we quickly find bond on a personal mission to kill blofeld once and for all after the death of bond s only true wife \( discounting the false marriage in you only live twice \) in on her majesty s secret service \( at least this is what we must assume since no mention of the marriage is made in diamonds are forever \) bond catches blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and after a couple of struggles with both blofeld and a duplicate bond drowns blofeld in a vat of mud it is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence the titles involves various diamonds slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women all set to the title song sung by shirley bassey \( who also sang the goldfinger title \) the plot of diamonds are forever is quite strange in an opening similar to goldfinger we learn that large quantities of south african diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet surprisingly have not made their way to the market worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation disguised as peter franks bond quickly succeeds meeting up with tiffany case \( jill st john \) an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of bond s identity bond s mission is almost compromised from the start when the real peter franks makes an entrance forcing bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in from russia with love after a smuggling attempt goes awry \( thanks to bond \) bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating it turns out that blofeld is behind it all \( bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser \) blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on earth blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse willard whyte \( jimmy dean \) whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world and using whyte s resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in america russia and china the purpose blofeld is organizing an international auction offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder will bond be able to stop him in time diamonds are forever feels like a film that was stitched together rather poorly from a myriad of interesting elements one feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order the infiltration of a smuggling ring the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator the quirky and gay hitmen mr wint \( bruce glover \) and mr kidd \( putter smith \) a not so subtle rendition of the famous las vegas recluse howard hughes a fight on an oil rig et cetera all of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right but the combination doesn t yield what the producers were hoping for what is it about this film that feels so ridiculous one of the major problems in my opinion is situating bond in las vegas bond in america is dull his class wit and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of las vegas in the 1970s bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations not to a strip club furthermore the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series i think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd the chase is boring the buggy looks ridiculous and prop esque and there is no suspense the climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring sure we have a big set and big explosions but there is no cutting edge stuff here connery as mentioned looks very tired here tiffany case is a bit refreshing but quickly becomes dim witted and dull and the bond girl with the clever name plenty o toole \( lana wood \) is only in the film for all of five minutes blofeld is now played by charles gray who first made his appearance as bond s japan contact in you only live twice gray s performance takes blofeld back to the ridiculousness of you only live twice even appearing in drag at one point there isn t much more to say the acting is dead in diamonds are forever now some have tried to defend diamonds are forever by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the bond genre after producing six bond films the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move bond into the roger moore pun fest the series would eventually become while this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film it seems plainly false if you watch the making of documentary on the ultimate edition it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real bond flick and not a parody the producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box office success they were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the bond formula anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization this film stinks let s get over it ultimately i think you should skip diamonds are forever the only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order it is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between sean connery and roger moore the ultimate edition does have crisp picture and sound if you must struggle through the film make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable but if you only desire to watch the better bond films skip it diamonds may be forever but this film died a long time ago,negative

well this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get unfortunately the female teenage protagonist \( played by witherspoon whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here \) acts masculine and heroic the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point the girl runs around acting like a commando a veritable one gal army blowing up the bad guys while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal s backpack as they cross a desert the gal snaps at him bella abzug style and walks quickly ahead leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course in the real world the result for such manly girls once they become women is that men do not choose them and they remain alone and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men of course in this movie the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy masculine gal but that s why they call them movies when are these post modern writers artists and other culture shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them not compete with them men crave femininity in females not feminism wow is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie instead of craven and flippant he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual type with a wild boy haircut if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she s still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside down gender relations uh another problem with this movie and there are many is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert something which should be and for a time is here depicted as a foreboding and life threatening task yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog and we see the boy s flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out of place manner considering the dire situation they are in the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light hearted inane scenes look i dig disney kid movies more realistic ones you know old style disney movies you take old yeller for example now there was a quality kid movie and quite true to life this movie was not it had a plastic spoiled american materialistic teenybopper feel throughout disney has gone down the tubes in any number of ways they ve been subverted by radical marxist agendas \( note one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion something called tapping while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un pc judeo christian religion this is bias folks leftwing pc bias same as the aforementioned feminist bilge \) i am learning to run not walk away from disney stuff and this movie was further cause for me to do so,negative
if you ve read the book this movies is extremely loosely based on you will understand why the movie is so horrid it s beautiful to look at but that is all the sets and costumes are gorgeous but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a queen of france this movie completely ignores the revolution marie antoinette s arrest and murder in short the movie ignores anything that is not pretty girlish and light there is so much fluff and teen angst that it s hard to locate any fact in the film at all do we really need a 10 close up of kristen dunst wistfully lazing about her apartments after she meets a handsome man even one scene like this is bad enough but it happens over and over we see kids at play more than adults with real problems and the actors and soundtrack only reinforce this feeling there is shopping food dress up and flirting but minus a handful of very short scenes no real account of the lives of the king and queen of france there was little in the way of dialog and sadly much of what there was was murmured while dunst flounced around in her pretty dresses there is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that it s almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog for instance the dauphin and 2 brothers which we are told in the book the film is based on however in the film the brothers are combined into one very inaccurate character marie antoinette also had 2 sons not one as the movie will tell you i don t mind some changes for the sake of drama but ignoring 90 of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is factual is ridiculous the main actors are also terrible the supporting cast such as rip torn and marriane faithful is wonderful they only serve to make kirsten dunst look that much worse no one bother to act french or like the poised rulers in training that their character were the movie is so obviously a veichle for dunst that it s sickening there is just too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for her to be there remember the 10 minute scene i described where she does nothing but smile it keeps happening it gets very very old it feels more like a photo shoot for dunst than a film i usually like kirsten dunst but not in this film overall the film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been one there just isn t enough going on to warrent the film s length and it s really geared towards young girls who love pretty dresses food and shopping but have no taste for fact it s a chick flick at it s worst and it makes a mockery of the life of such an important person it s very hard to believe that this came from the same person who wrote and directed films like the virgin suicides and lost in translation,negative
really does not get the film noir credit it deserves \( probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring dinah shore or other 1940 s musical starlet \) some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale gene tierney is wonderfully mercurial sometimes hot hot hot and other times just plain icy cold this was her only oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here see gene in this and in laura and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances,positive

i was very disappointed with this film the premise was really intriguing with elvis switching places with an elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at graceland leaving the real elvis to scratch out a living as what else an elvis impersonator and now at the end of the king s life he s a semi invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy since it s texas the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to stevie ray vaughn and oh yeah jfk is also in this nursing home having inexplicably been transformed into ozzie davis how can you miss with a setup like this well for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there s no real need to provide any additional comedy the movie is flat with very little humor as other reviewers have noted it moves at a glacial pace even allowing for the protagonists being 80 somethings who don t move like they used to sure the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film but there s no point in making a comdey that isn t funny nice try but booooooooooring not at all recommended,negative

this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great including a phenomenal cast lead by cate blanchett and great scenery and cinematography the actors playing elizabeth cecil and walsingham spoke and acted admirably each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling but the words themselves rendered the performances useless the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material they should have read elizabeth the first s biography by elizabeth jenkins it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain had the author and director been more historically accurate they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth who is in turn hysterical defeatist overbearing childish tyrannical who never shows her core intelligence her great love of her people who had a private core described by her motto semper eadem be always one elizabeth ruled with her advisors she was not totally ruled by them she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table nor would burleigh have allowed it cate blanchett s wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity much less truth how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna i suggest that he should have first read some english history,negative

the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i ve compared the two and the first dvd had good color saturation dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now though and the image of course is higher resolution,negative
you know i actually enjoyed the first mummy it was funny the idea not often seen in modern films was good and the characters were each in their own way entertaining to watch why god why did they have to go and make a sequel i don t understand was it for the money i m not sure when exactly i began to hate this maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake again really you d think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it s thousand year rest they d learn their lesson but oh no the first time wasn t enough and also the whole having a kid thing didn t seem to work the relationship between the characters wasn t the same anymore i hate it when they do that in movies make sequels and give the once cool main characters children nothing against it just felt wrong for this movie throughout most of this movie i felt stupid and i don t like for things to make me feel that way i also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater maybe it s just me i just didn t like it question of the day for american cinema what s the deal with being obsessed with sequels come on the first was good enough you know what the worst thing is i was actually looking forward to seeing this,negative

while scary movie 4 does work in getting out a couple of laughs it certainly does not live up to the past three many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly are getting pretty old although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as the grudge saw and war of the worlds it misses the funny mark just by a bit personally i felt they could have done a lot more in terms of parodying these films particularily with the grudge the writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier and really was it necessary to spoof films such as brokeback mountain and millionaire dollar baby both of which are not horror films i believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience and is vastly different from what scary movies 1 2 offered \( which i found to be extremely hilarious \) if you re looking for over the top funny look towards the other scary movies,negative

okay the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful the only good thing going for this movie was the return of snake plissken this film s plot was essentially a rehash of the original escape from new york a bit more special effects \( which in fact did not make this a better movie \) when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character characters kurt russell s character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them obviously the movie doesn t really know where it s going as it takes two scenes \( 15 minutes of the film \) \( 1st scene president commandant and lackey give snake the mission \) \( 2nd scene commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission \) to explan to the audience what s the basic conflict i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer carpenter russell please don t tell me money caused you to revisit a cult figure some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson stacy keach steve buscemi and pam grier robertson keach and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters sorry snake i don t love l a the big green pointy eared one,negative
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star sorry i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was overdone too much blood killing and the like it was totally historically inaccurate and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar yet he does not even load it either time and somehow without even aiming the canon he knocks his friend off his horse the movie is a failure f a i l u r e crappy junky just plain dumb stupid pathetic i am not going to waste any more words on it just whatever you do save your money don t buy it it s not worth 50 cents,negative
this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy the first time i did it i felt a bit awkward with the steps but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine if someone like denise austin were leading this one i don t think i would play along minna is by far my favorite instructor so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout i wouldn t want to do this every day but it is good to have something different in the rotation i think the toning section is excellent i am not looking to bulk up i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises it s easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights minna is a great instructor she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging she is never annoying i also have her optimizer balanced blend dvd and i love that one,positive

my god this was the most idiotic horror film since blair witch all the character were utterly retarded they had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all duh so the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons and the ending made no sense whatsoever the ben guy is tried for their deaths sure that makes sense it s not as though they couldn t find the mine where the actual murderer was and get a crudload of dna evidence and dead bodies not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that exact place total piece of junk a wasted opportunity for all involve,negative
wow this was awful the best thing about this dvd is that it doesn t last long my boyfriend and i sat down to watch this together \( in the mood to begin with \) and both of us were completely turned off by it the woman is not even naked and wears a nightie throughout the dvd she also is extremely hairy \( a matter of personal taste i know but this was very extreme \) the tone of it was decidedly unsexy more of a strictly how to than a way to excite the watcher \( s \) it seemed to me to be very low budget and unimaginative spend your money on something else if you re looking for sexual excitement,negative
not a great one here entertaining for all the wrong reasons mainly because the film is so bad so often it is nice to see christina ricci in a movie again as she s usually good even in a bad movie and doesn t do too bad here wes craven directs this one and i could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation \( much like edward norton in the italian job \) i could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects as they were very lousy at times especially when they finally showed the werewolf as i said before quite predictable the story was both ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck then both try to figure out what s wrong with them though the brother is much more active about it than ricci it s also quite obvious who the main werewolf was the film tries a bit of a swerve but it doesn t really work besides ricci the cast includes shannon elizabeth \( american pie 1 2 \) portia de rossi \( arrested development \) joshua jackson \( pacey on dawson s creek \) scott baio \( don t ask me why \) among others all do pretty poor jobs besides ricci that is the rest don t really seem to care not that i blame them that is there is some humor throughout the film but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it the only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew,negative

fais moi des vacances \( we need a vacation \) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in france while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads directed and written by didier bivel \( with writing assistance from djamila djabri \) it offers a slice of life we rarely see that underbelly of france s projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods lucien \( aymen sa di \) lives with his father \( bernard blancan \) mother \( hiam abbass \) young sister pamela \( laura mas navarro \) and his tough streetwise older brother jos \( nabil el bouhairi \) in a small flat close by is his african friend adama \( ibrahim koma \) and his equally poor family of father \( makan fofana \) mother \( marie philom ne nga \) and sister fanta \( hawa yakar sissoko \) as school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation a state neither lucien nor adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury the two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a ruv of a family headed for the beach but despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van s owners the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp a fact that makes them flee upon returning home both boys families punish their activities and when lucien seeks comfort from his older brother jos beats him and tells him to grow up in the end the boys finagle their way to the beach but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re evaluating their lives the cast is uniformly strong the writing is excellent and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys imaginations it is a fine little film one deserving of a wide audience grady harp january 07,positive
what a huge disappointment this release is i was suspecting that it wouldn t be all that great when i saw that the studio that originally produced this show 20th century fox was the same video company releasing it well the first season looks horrible the source material is all 16mm dupe prints some parts of which are out of focus scratched and dirty in all cases the image is soft and well like 16mm compared to what fox is releasing of voyage to the bottom of the sea produced the same year \( 1964 \) and at the same studio as boone this release is nothing short of a disgrace we should be given pristine 35mm source material and we re not i suspect fox wouldn t release the original camera negs from it s vaults without a substantial fee anyway season one of daniel boone isn t worth buying i haven t seen season two when the show started filming in color but i m now afraid to look,negative

there aren t many films from any era that come close to being perfect \( though that s not really the right word \) in just about every way probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over friendly persuasion is one of those films in spades directed by william wyler and starring gary cooper dorothy mcguire and tony perkins it is a wonderful human story about a loving family of quakers \( also known as friends \) living in one of the union confederate border states at the time of the civil war in the 1860s the cast in small roles and large is uniformly excellent none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them led by beloved legendary star gary cooper in a great performance as the head of the quaker family jess birdwell they are marvelous including child actor richard eyer as feisty little jess scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with samantha his mother eliza birdwell s pet goose who more than carries her end of the feud with scene stealing craftiness there are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements and a hilarious episode in which eldest son josh \( perkins \) accompanies father jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy amorous daughters of one of jess s customers \( marjorie main \) we are settled into a lovely lively exploration of the birdwell family s idyllic existence then the war intrudes josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to even though it is against the teachings of his faith his younger sister loves a young union officer who is soon to go into battle rebel troops are nearing the region where they live and no one including the audience quite knows what will happen there is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young josh gets his first taste of battle which perkins performs with heartbreaking realism i recall my father a world war ii veteran saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man s first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies when it is all over and the birdwells return to their quiet hard working loving life as a family the music \( dimitri tiomkin s marvelous score \) swells the wonderful lyrics to the song friendly persuasion are sung sweetly by the young pat boone and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times the story has been told with integrity honesty humanity gentle humor kind restraint and yes love all of these also attributes of the birdwell family that we have come to know that is the genius of this film along with a very few others it shows us who we are who we can be and how we can live all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic and the film never ever loses its balance it s just a great and good movie i ve seen it almost a dozen times and it can still move me to tears i m betting it could be released today amid the ridiculously over budgeted badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma and that it would clean up at the box office the term family values has been kicked around a lot lately and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it watch this truly beautiful film and you ll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words,positive
monkey business looks pretty good on dvd 50 years later the restoration comparison on the dvd shows the change the restoration brought a bit darkly tinted and more defined the wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout marilyn monroe who is the star on the dvd box has more of a supporting role here she is great as the secretary lois laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn t like her punctuation cary grant as the addled professor barnaby fulton turns in a great journeyman performance getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth his driving sequence with monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks ginger rogers as wife edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth if all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions it d be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings hugh marlowe as the straight laced attorney hank entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy indian game oscar winner charles coburn \( 1943 the more the merrier \) does a great job of appreciating monroe s assets as oliver oxly the ceo kathleen freeman as mrs brannigan gives a fine performance the dvd offers perviews of many monroe films this is a great little piece of cinematic history turn back the clock enjoy,positive

here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made i couldn t believe what i was watching moreover i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema s most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor ralph fiennes how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do entertain sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as the constant gardener it appears that we unfortunate real film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future,negative

many people criticized this movie for having no plot which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex there s just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain dougray scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of scottish actors john woo uses some wonderful australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes the gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow motion which robs them of any realism or hardcore seeing as how this is a pg 13 the action is also pretty damn tame which is a shame since woo is a pro at this you hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit it s all done off screen if people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire woo to direct it s a bit puzzling although it is tame it is still darker and harder than the original but the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap i can t believe robert towne had a hand in writing this it s like a rejected plot to a solid snake ps1 game there s seems to be some focus on making it a james bond die hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set pieces another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is zimmer s score for a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music but none of that is present in mi 2 this was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass produced soulless stuff which is also a shame it s the wrong plot the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots they really under estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one john woo s original cut was 3 5 hours long none of that footage is on this new special edition dvd what a waste,negative
when kerouac ginsberg and burroughs set out in their writing they had no idea what it would create a whole movement this film including interviews taken when ginsberg and burroughs were alive assembles clips from media film and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats up to the passing away of ginsberg and burroughs with a large assembly of other beat writers and the poets they influenced \( carroll and bukowski \) it is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement it is interesting to see the beat propaganda of the sixties how negative and mocking the media treated the sense of a cool movement they painted a false portrait this film is for lovers of beat or people genuinely interested however if you do not like documentaries you won t like this one also i was disappointed to see depp hopper and turturro reciting long pieces of work when the actual writers could have performed it honestly i skipped these parts i wanted to see ginsburg doing howl another disappointment is the dvd version which was slapped together on the fly i envisioned additional clips and useful information \( let s face it you can put tons on a dvd \) but only had 2 or 3 screens of names credited for making the movie and the trailer \( in this case not exciting \) however with all disappointments aside this film is good for a few viewings it conveys a better picture of the beats than other films have before and enjoyed alot of the material,positive

i remember watching this in high school i thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now okay we re not talking academy award material here \( emmy \) ralph bill pam are back for the third and final season of this far too short series about a man who is given a suit by aliens that gives him super powers he is teamed with an fbi agent to help the world survive itself in the first few minutes ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how to operate the suit he runs into a few walls literally the first season was a little rough the second season fleshed out the concept this third season started to stretch its legs but the show was cancelled i have looked for years for novels based on the show to no avail i even contacted cannell to ask if i could write them as disney is half heartedly working on a feature film based on the show cannell wouldn t cut loose with permission alas it would ve been fun anyway if you have the other two seasons you ll love this one the only complaint change i would make is having to play the theme song before each episode i would ve made it so you could hit the forward to next button and go right to the action also the jacket plays a bit of the theme song i wish they d made it possible to change the batteries mike hudspeth in st louis missour,positive
in this sixth \( but not final \) installment of the movie series what we get is little story and too much senseless action \( with a sprinkling of hot tub sex \) this is a very disappointing film although it is the last such lwnc movie from this creative team it does not end the storyline \( with 28 volumes in the manga series we probably would have needed another 3 7 films \) so the patient constant viewer gets instead a hack and slash film of mid caliber the ending an over extending action sequence set on a snowy slope is very unsatisfying so are the characters unlike other lwnc films we do not get to meet any new incidental characters as a result the film is less about edo soceity \( which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team \) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen waiting waiting to happen the film is way too long and its pacing is horrible i think the fault with the film lies in these two things 1 \) the writers filmmakers chose poor source material the five wheel assassin team denies itto and son the chance to mingle with regular edo joes as a result you do not get as i argued the best part of the series the rich detail of edo life 2 \) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with james bond films like on her majesty s secret service and whatnot with their decision to make this movie samurai on skis after the first few minutes of fighting on the snow i was thinking enough already i get it samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment,negative

you might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut but it s actually the opposite i really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school this is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people this movie is the real thing i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too,positive

i saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re release and subsequently on dvd i can readily attest that it does not age i m not even a dog person myself but the plot is not about dogs per say but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named lady has living with owners named darling and jim dear lady apparently leads a pretty good life assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy she is later shocked to meet tramp who lives on the streets however she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior she needs his help when crusty old aunt sarah comes to mind the house and the newborn baby initially not understanding that lady feels protective towards the baby she also selectively ignores the damage which her two siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate victorian house amazingly aunt sarah presumes that lady was responsible for wrecking the house and attempts to muzzle her up like any streetwise character tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up however he does not come across as an annoying know it all who you would want to quickly get rid of tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments lady had gentle friends named jock and trusty but they can t help out in a world also outside of their own of course the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time it made a very profound impact on me well before i was even old enough to myself consider dating i imagined that i would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own mr right however tramp s decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene he then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than lady but saved the baby anyway tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars tramp ultimately gets adopted by the darlings therefore he and lady do in fact live happily ever after,positive
with a good script and a director better suited to the material \( i ve read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct \) asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson unfortunately the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist s wife \( an excellent natasha richardson \) and one of the asylum s patients \( an equally good marton csokas \) under the watchful eye of the patient s doctor \( ian mckellen \) there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie some of which seem quite preposterous at least in the way the movie was shot the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson she does her best in spite of the choppy script and she even won a best actress award in london for this film however as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job \( in fact i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson credited as an executive producer sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out,negative

these are not the original theatrical realeases in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the color timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels though they are an impressive technical achievement i ll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger,negative

the french title of this film is in extremis \( though translated as to the extreme \) and means in desperate circumstances especially at the point of death rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing gives the cinematic effort more poignancy this is a tale of the impact of family loss of parents dissolution of the core unit has on us all in this story we are asked to exam the in extremis state of such trauma thomas \( s bastien roch \) is a hedonist a handsome young man whose parents died in an alpine accident and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity he lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son gr goire \( j r my sanguinetti \) whom he loves as a son when the mother accidentally dies gr goire wants thomas to be his guardian thomas lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves gr goire by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent even with the aid of his prostitute sister anne \( julie depardieu \) he is unable to keep the disappointed gr goire from being sent to a prison like orphanage thomas finds solace from his lover vincent \( aur lien wiik \) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for gr goire eventually thomas devotion to gr goire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy s escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in ibiza his deceased parents owned the story has a bizarre but touching ending which comes totally unexpectedly and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film director writer etienne faure \( prisonnier and la recherche de tadzio which is included on this cd and traces the life of the actor bj rn andresen who played tadzio in the film death in venice \) directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks fantasies graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music but given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family genetic and extended and therein is the power of the story this is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place in french with english subtitles grady harp may 05,positive
i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd it is here a very good movie i have to say the inspector carson \( belonging to an unknown federal agency \) character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate his lines in the movie \( particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan kris kristofferson \) discuss politics during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra great bit part acting by rip torn roberts blossom \( as the desert rat \) tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well anyone who has been in law enforcement or any other supervisory capacity for that matter has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol totally inept the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes a must see movie,positive

i think that anyone who believes this movie to be hilarious or hudson s performance overrated and over the top in her singing just doesn t like musicals or perhaps doesn t like an all black cast \( i am not black \) or is too young to understand the 60 s world of music and payola and backstabbing while touted to be similar to the experiences suffered by the supremes with diana ross as its lead singer it is close in some aspects and totally far away in others the key words here are loosely based on the story of the supremes why people including ross herself don t get that is beyond me over the top if anyone saw the original play with jennifer holliday \( i did see it \) then you don t know the meaning of over the top that character was supposed to be that way and hudson did a wonderful job of that her performance overrated hogwash she deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever beyonce s performance was good but not great this was in part because her character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was it of the play this was beyonce s best acting performance thus far though she still needs some work and the right role this was not the right role for her in my opinion hudson s character is the main and central character which puzzles me for the supporting actress win though as lead actress she probably would have lost you people out there don t take my word for this movie s greatness and take on a true part of history even if it was white washed no pun intended or don t think its a bad movie like some other critics here you must judge for yourself i hope and think that you won t be disappointed there are some more than subtle references to the supremes and diana ross especially in some of the costumes beyonce s images and album covers \( cd covers for you youngsters \) but only die hard fans of the supremes and people who were there at that time would know that enjoy,positive
this is a fantastic version of taming of the shrew for anyone who is interested in really studying the text \( and hearing it spoken correctly \) this is the version for you the actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying \( yipee \) they also have an uncanny way of speaking the speech which gets it across to the audience as clear as day you dont need to understand shakespearean verse to see this performance the actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast which i belive they are,positive

with the phenomenal success of the poseidon adventure the first disaster movie of its kind the sequel was sure to be a hit not so a plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great having a leading lady \( sally fields \) fresh from an oscar win and a few veteran actors \( michael caine karl malden \) might also sound promising unfortunately the magic of the set production of the original is not even close instead of upside ballrooms barber shops kitchens and bathrooms the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes the rest of the cast is comprised of television actors who are as wooden as the script there s no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous you won t even laugh in disbelief irwin allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel considering the original that s a terrible shame,negative

in an attempt to meet more girls i took french many many years ago when i was still in junior high school \( middle school to you young uns \) in class my french teacher treated us to a film screening of jean cocteau s la belle et la bete \( beauty and the beast \) truthfully back then i didn t think much of it other than being something too arty but over the past two decades i ve seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it la belle et la bete is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema it s certainly cocteau s masterpiece without a doubt it provided the direct inspiration for disney s oscar nominated version as well as greatly influencing cbs s 1987 beauty and the beast television series jean cocteau took madame leprince de beaumont s classic story adapted it and put his own stamp on it cocteau s artistic vision is dazzling to behold the viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch candles vocal household objects jewelry which turns to rubbish etc but nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around belle s family which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality based semblance this atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads josette day and jean marais josette day as belle her most luminous role personified beauty grace and class jean marais on the other hand made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel avenant and the tortured but gentle hearted beast in fact marais portrayed the fearsome beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that in the end when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince cocteau and marais actually received many letters of complaint the women much preferred their kindly beast the criterion collection s high definition crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older grainier copies this film is also well stocked with special features 2 audio commentaries a philip glass opera soundtrack option screening at the majestic a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew interview with the film s director of photography henri alekan secret professionels tete a tete \( professional secrets face to face \) the title of a french television show of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist hagop arakelian who worked on la belle et la bete the original trailer the restoration trailer film restoration segment stills gallery a booklet which includes jean cocteau s notes on the film and a reprinted translation of madame leprince de beaumont s original fable,positive
the first half of this movie starts out promising the 2nd half is not so good it becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical whereas it started out charming and promising of particular annoyance is the ending where we find the hackneyed politically correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple s separation and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he indeed the wife s character is strikingly uneven in this movie her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half quite inconsistent,negative

well at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit based on a book written on 1902 it s nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward but also his future wife he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date to our more contemporary \( and one hopes more enlightened \) attitudes there s no post colonial guilt here whatsoever in some ways this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material in another way it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie all of this wouldn t matter much if the movie was entertaining unfortunately it is only intermittently so,negative
the flight into new york had been a long one but i was gently revived when kirsten dunst met me at the airport she was to be my escort that night at the lincoln center where the president would present me the distinguished writer s cross the highest award this nation can bestow on an author i quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her mercedes s class sedan to the waldorf astoria downtown i have to admit that i didn t you who you were until i read starless grasslands i don t mean to embarrass you but that book changed my life i tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment for the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while i approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile i very much approved of her legs as i departed the car kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes don t forget i ll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together please be ready i expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp the hotel staff greeted me and soon i entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor as i entered the suite the steward took my request to have my suit blushed prepared and returned in a few hours finally a bit of peace i poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below for a few moments i contemplated the remarks i was to make at this evening s formal ceremonies then i heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room i turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked sandy bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit well crabby aren t you glad to see me before i could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right it was jennifer aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit sweetheart don t look at her come here to me get out screamed sandy no you get out it s not fair i left brad for him so i get him the two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment then sandy leapt at jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other it was a ferocious sight as pulled hair shrieks of pain and nylon tearing could be heard then almost a quickly as it began the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor sandy marched back into the room victorious i ran to the door of the sitting room only to see jennifer laid out on the floor out cold spread eagle and naked before i could think of what to do sandy tapped me on my shoulder i turned around and there sandy stood a little worse for wear trying to catch her breath nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet forget her she won t bother us now sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume she posed standing and anticipating my admiration now i m all sweaty and warm i need a shower sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond i turned around and wondered what i should do for poor jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor then i heard sandy calling crabby why don t you come and help me you could soap up my oops sorry err just a little fantasy of mine i meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over i swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here you see the cover of this dvd displays ms bullock prominently with her name in big font letters but in truth this movie focuses on tate donovan as the main character and only on ms bullock as his unlikely love interest as much as i love sandra bullock i have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her her best films have been while you were sleeping wrestling ernest hemingway and the much unappreciated hope floats unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like fire on the amazon hangman speed 2 and this movie the plot revolves around two losers in love who are unappealing both in looks and personality donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman \( an unrecognizable anne bancroft \) and soon both donovan and bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet all goes well until others find out their secret and donovan and bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other the story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet chances are you can find a copy of this dvd fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you re waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work or your friends to wake up from their naps so you can really do something worth wild,negative
i read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives a lively debate there were so many brilliant things said about the film that i found myself passing out helpful votes \( to both positive blisteringly negative reviews \) like they were candy the movie is an evocative work of art i encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view i agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers but i will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned the dvd cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers a sort of blue lagoon from the renaissance it is not it is misleading i concede a \) the story is probably not historically accurate b \) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition c \) tossi was probably inconsiderate conceited and immoral but the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters having said that i do object that the movie according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available is not just inaccurate but oppositional to what probably occurred therefore i critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person the movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional \( or incorrect \) causal factors and those cause effect relationships don t seem to ring true having said that i agree with some of richard burt s review comments that historical accuracy may still be subject to interpretation it is reasonable that artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial \( defending her freedom and reputation \) than she might have been with tassi personally and it seems too easy to just paint tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done there is usually more complexity and diverse conflicting interests in most people especially artists one strong objection near the end of the film artemisia says no one dies of sorrow while there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment the line frustrated me people do die of sorrow my limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest most sensitive artistic and caring people i ve encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow and the people i have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow not selfish controlling or passive aggressive sorrow but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations often unidentified misunderstood misconceptions sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit character the soul creativity sorrow is not incidental sorrow can destroy health or as the angel of america in angels in america says the body is the garden of the soul sorrow is worth full attention the movie tries to examine the effect of artemisia s loyalties to her father and her teacher the screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply good or bad both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on artemesia her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression they work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts at the same time they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices privacy and pacing beyond her desired level of influence artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father s drive and design at the same time she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in in polite society may your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find and may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties compare caravaggio s judith beheading holofernes to artemisia s version of the same painting her version is more violent realistic \( less idealized in posing dirtiness lighting etc \) her version has the female servant actively helping judith artemisia s paintings show a palpable understanding of hate violence sexuality compassion artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best that s why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions,negative
wow that s the only thing i can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews i admit the very first time i watched the grudge with my father neither of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn t understand its success but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night i really began to see how frightening the movie is probably contains the same amount of fear as the original exorcist another movie that s really effectively well done you have to watch the exorcist and the grudge at night to get the proper effect the grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story i say pretty interesting because the storyline isn t the best or the easiest to understand just interesting enough to get the job done the grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little in fact this is probably its strongest point every time something scary happens you see just a little bit of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect which is very important if you want to effectively scare someone if the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn t have scared me nearly as much because i would have gotten used to seeing it the boy appears and then he s gone not giving away too much really works with this movie you see to really scare me you simply can t put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you have to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable the grudge works extremely well it this area the fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the grudge allows me to give the film another compliment i m telling you the scene with the woman inside that building by herself \( well except for a security guard \) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone chilling excitement i loved this scene i was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her the scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was awesome and the scene a few moments after this happened where she did see something in the shadow was another awesome display of bone chilling brilliance there s a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie freakin awesome excellent pacing and suspense makes the grudge a true horror classic in my opinion i ve seen a thousand horror movies in my time and i d easily put the grudge right up there as one of the best people today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the exorcist was the scariest movie of all time i wish everyone agreed that the grudge is a total classic and that the ring is another excellent one,positive
i have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this even my old tapes from tv were 500 better the picture was faded the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words so looking away from the movie did not help it is also one hour long but seemed like three probably a copy of a tv movie as it also had cuts for commercials though i could not find any place that said this it was advertised as a 2 hour dvd and it is i guess but i could not see any more of it at the end of one hour it just showed credits and it was over i am returning it and it is the first copy of a dvd that i have ever returned for picture and sound quality,negative
these plays were okay i m glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice the actors didn t gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre \( definitely no tyler perry quality on that note \) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o neal sang in one of them but he didn t,negative

i had high hopes for this series when i started watching it though i guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover shandala is truly a wonderful character pure and good and the characterization of her is very tender so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting oh how wrong of me to think so because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings the message of hope the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain s demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the truth is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent good woman is the only way to save the world spare me and if you think that i am disgusted by this message just imagine what the muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the koran and the muslim character s final opinions although the story is technically good i m only giving it one star for the message of despair,negative
having drooled over the goodtimes dvd for years now i did a flip and a half when i saw universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story i refrained from doing two flips when i remembered it was universal and then saw no mention of special features what look at the potential for bonuses there was an alternate ending there were deleted scenes how about a featurette argh i just wept and wept and then months later the release date comes i tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically i hit menu and get the nagging old operation prohibited by disc usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old fbi warnings there s not even a menu no scene selection geez do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus i d like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of sarandon and spader note how spader s hair changes near the end because of reshoots but i m just too raving mad at universal right now,positive

the economy austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers lang a master of the german expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies it was a shocking idea for its time based on the real life killer peter kurten headlined as the vampire of d sseldorf m is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes \( often chewing candy \) who is a pathological child killer unable to control his urge for killing the film embodies several lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity for the killer is clearly mentally sick he cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man early in the film the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from in the hall of the mountain king this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the sound track told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sight the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since casablanca the maltese falcon and the mask of dimitrios when the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horror with powerful visuals lang s motion picture is lorre s first film his performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion lorre is the archetypal outsider outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal he had only twelve lines of dialog in the most famous of all about a pathological killer alfred hitchcock s psycho anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of m is subtle a child s balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed the audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,positive
warning spoilers abound okay folks i was flipping channels and came across a movie called the hole starring thora birch keira knightley and desmond harrington now aside from this terrible blunder i m going to tell you about in just a few more sentences the film was fairly entertaining i dig thora birch and her character was really well played what really shocked me though was my quick research after the film was over i mean i checked imdb rotten tomatoes and wikipedia although all reputable sources none mentioned this ridiculous mistake have you ever been so utterly sure of something so blantantly painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an entirely different alien planet to be able to even minutely comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents that s how i felt after watching this movie and realizing that apparently i m the only goddamn human being on this prosaic infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for what it was and what exactly was this stupendous error you ask well it s very simple i mean it couldn t get more common sensically moronic than this the basic plot of the film is four teenagers trapped in an old war bunker the movie begins with thora birch s rendition of what happened that her friend set this whole thing up locked them in the hole and didn t come back when he was supposed to she escapes and the three others die the story changes from what she originally told her psychiatrist to what actually happened turns out the only way out was actually locked from the inside and thora had the key the whole time the other teenagers die for various reasons irrelevant to the blunder at hand and she ends up telling the tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker in the end she kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him the police come and find thora and her psychiatrist in the hole and after rebuking the psychiatrist mention that the case is now closed at that moment a flashback shows thora murdering her friend that set everything up and planting the key on him right after that moment i said to myself what the heck the door locks from the inside it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that either a \) the door was never locked or b \) someone had to unlock it from the inside alright those weren t my exact words but good god it s so obvious and that my friends has got to be possibly the worst film blunder ever,negative

i purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was pg that it would be fine also the market for transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere wow were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie these were not just words like shoot or dang but the real deal i remember transformers when i was growing up and i certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons i am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office concerned in alabam,negative

i first caught the black swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away sure it s just a swashbuckler just a pirate film with the usual plot the usual bits and pieces there s nothing outrageously distinctive about the black swan at least at first sight ty power stars as jamie boy expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex pirate and now governer of jamaica captain morgan laird cregar \) morgan s been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers sending jamie boy off to find george sanders captain leech only there s a twist in the mix and some dastardly fop s out to make a mockery of morgan by using leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer to make matters worse jamie not only seemingly disappears apparently in league with the nefarious leech but he also kidnaps the previous governer s daughter played with feistyness by catherien o hara so it s all the usual stuff kidnapping sword fighting stealing drinking pacts with arch enemies and stock characters throughout but you know what it s not that you know what you re getting it s that you get a whole lot more than you ever thought you would sure everything s the same but somehow strangely different the story and characters are as seen before but with the likes of sanders power and o hara as the love interest and the great character actor cregar playing against type you have life breathed into the character s that s so often lacking and the original story by one rafael sabatini who also brought us captain blood and the sea hawk is a rip roaring boys own adventure director henry king no stranger to producing similar adventure styled flicks cracks the picture along with some sense of urgency it s a spare fluid film with a simple but fun narrative and visual splendour that puts other films even those made today out to pasture this dvd manages to capture that splendour in abundance the technicolor photography is gorgeously rendered herein with all of the detailed production and costune design seen at its best just check out the restoration comparison to see how good in addition the disc also features a fine commentary from historian rudy behlmer if you want a cracking piece of entertainment that puts shame to modern counterparts of the genre look no further,positive
this comedy like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through the characters in this film can be hated at points especially michael douglas and matt dillon s but there is a lighter side owen wilson is very likeable as dupree an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job the cast is fine and one of the strength s in this film however i think it gets too serious at points this is supposed to be a comedy after all i wouldn t buy it but it is certainly worth renting,positive
another film in the never ending series of giant animated snake eats people films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade the creators of a maximum security prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten million plus slumber of 80 foot hungry reptile there s nothing more to this film than that boa \( also known as new alcatraz \) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness which i don t think was a smart idea the technical team photography production design set decoration etc create a fairly effective chilling atmosphere but everything else about boa is strictly routine dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable although elizabeth lackey is just that lacking as his wife and the supporting cast \( mark sheppard grand l bush craig wasson \) is just a touch more professional the film makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we can t see just how fake it looks i don t really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with other similar titles include python 1 and 2 anaconda \( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 \) and anaconda search for the blood orchid and the inevitable boa vs python the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors 2,negative

ohm ohm ohm back in 2000 ellipsis arts released ohm the early gurus of electronic music a fantastic and essential three cd set tracing the evolution of electronica from messiaen cage and xenakis to schulze eno and hassell this set was recently reissued \( as ohm \) along with a bonus dvd which is thankfully now available separately for those of us who already have the cds the ohm dvd is jam packed with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably dull if seemingly endless talking head interviews with milton babbitt and bebe barron are your idea of video entertainment you ve come to the right place an interview with john cage digitally altered beyond all recognition check swirling psychadelic colored dyes right out of a saucerful of secrets era pink floyd concert no problem there are some tastier goodies to be found on this dvd however the segments with clara rockmore and leon theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie quality to them it s also a real treat to see the 1978 footage of underappreciated minimalist guru david borden and mother mallard s portable masterpiece company on the road hauling around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment laurie spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey metal box called a concerto generator with an extremely serious expression on her face and alvin lucier s music for solo performer where he hooks up wires to his head and produces sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani simply must be seen to be believed the pixar ish computer animation accompanying paul lansky s the dust bunny is sort of cute but it goes on for about 10 minutes too long surely most of the ohm target audience already has the dvd of steve reich s three tales but it s nice that they included the best part the ominous yet goofy dolly segment many have also probably seen hans fjellestad s documentary moog before but the six minute excerpt provided here is really about all you need it s too bad there isn t a more interesting john cage segment and regrettable that there aren t any stockhausen videos \( those would certainly be a riot \) overall though while the ohm dvd is not as consistently engaging as the cd set of the same name it is a worthy companion to it and if you don t have either of them yet the complete ohm 3 cd dvd special edition box set is a no brainer,positive

when paul mccartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience it usually for more than just the average oh i have an album to promote let me go on tour his 1989 tour was paul s first time onstage in many years and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his beatles wings years but he also still was able to create a deep personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can this spawned the excellent double live album tripping the live fantastic as well as the exciting concert movie get back his 2002 american tour was a chance for paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on september 11th the cd and dvd back in the u s were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy in 2005 paul did something that had long been awaited since the beatles first hit ever since the cold war the beatles were a huge phenemenon in russia however there communist government considered their music alien propoganda and their music was outlawed still the russian citizens got their hands on the beatles recordings any way they could and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them making them belive there was a free world beyond the iron curtain over 40 years later paul ventured to moscow to perform a historic concert in red square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment the concert was filmed and was aired on a e as paul mccartney live in red square this is quite simply an excellent concert movie paul and his band are in top form paul clearly wanted to give the russian fans a night they d never forget pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as band on the run live and let die back in the u s s r hey jude and let it be as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as two of us i ve just seen a face and let em in mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how the beatles music had such a connection with the russians during the cold war and why they still remained so popular these interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers as an added bonus we get another concert of paul in st petersburg this is once again an excellent energetic and fun show that shows why paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world the sound and picture quality are excellent and the special features are a nice treat live in red square is an excellent dvd that belongs in everyone s collection,positive

never in my life have i seen a film dedicated to the subject of vichy france i had long read about it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the collaborationist government i assumed that the sorrow and the pity was strictly a documentary about the french resistance but was pleasantly surprised by its depth it describes the vichy of petain and laval quite thoroughly you may recognize some of ophuls interviewees from the world at war \( such as edward spears \) but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the ss i assume he served in the charlemagne outfit frankly i was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face his point that the slaughter of 1 600 french sailors by the english was a motivating force for him to join the germans was something i would have never considered it seems inconceivable back then for the french to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than england given the competition but it is clear that anglophobia was rampant after the rout of may 1940 the most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists it seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed petain \( at first \) and looked sympathetically to the nazis the speeches the newsreels and the photos are incredibly valuable and terribly interesting especially if you re a history buff i d rank this one right up there with hotel terminus,positive

if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you ninjaman elephantman nitty kutchie boom dandemite harry toddler and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format but it still shines despite these flaws the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick and doesn t do bad at all at the acting thing,positive

this just to voice my opinion on the new ran transfer while i agree it is an improvement over the atrocious fox lorber edition \( which is not that great an achievement considering the fox lorber dvd was one of the worst products in the history of home entertainment \) this tranfer is still a long way from doing this masterpiece justice yes the colors are vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and the heavy edge enhancement \( straight from hell \) doesn t make it any better i have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or 40 years older than ran but look far better the problem becomes very obvious when one watches this dvd via progressive component output on a large screen a video tape was used as a master \( and a poor one at that \) the only way to restore such an important movie properly and thereby finally showing mr kurosawa the respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital transfer off an original film negative before applying filters or any enhancements why this opportunity was \( again \) wasted here escapes me totally and angers me very much another problem seems to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video which is in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer for my part i would much sooner live with a bit of visible film grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a saucy soft picture without much bite and detail there is no excuse for posting such an objectively false statement and yes the packaging is a liability my dvds must have been bobbing about in there all the way across the atlantic and looked accordingly shocking i would have gladly payed twice the price if they had kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important thing right the image quality of ran like this i m very disappointed,negative

the talons of weng chiang is a wonderfully creepy pseudo historical tale full of mood atmosphere and an unusual amount of violence for doctor who almost as if departing producer philip hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out but it s not all gloom and doom this storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old doctor who humor at its funniest as well as thrilling doctor who adventure at its most gruesome the dank and dour city streets and slums of late 19th century london make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation madness and serial murder \( technologically refined cannibalism really \) and yet the doctor s many clever quips and leela s naively astute observations on civilized victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout and the main villain s second hand man li hsen chang has some incredibly witty one liners as well li hsen chang himself is a fascinating character delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to weng chiang a stranded time traveling dictator from the future who has deceived chang into believing he s a deity from the taoist pantheon chang s paranormal powers foremost of which is hypnotism definitely evoke the late victorian fascination with mesmerism \( see the poster advertising his show \) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil fu manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction and yet he s also a tragic figure in many ways a healthy innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his god and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process in many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the pygmalion style educational program the doctor s putting leela through to her annoyance if li hsen chang is an interesting and complex adversary though the same can t really be said for his master weng chiang himself he s a rather unremarkable two dimensional villain i m afraid complete with hokey bad guy laugh and over the top acting perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect but if so they overdid it just a bit at times too he s just more annoying than frightening every time the ever loyal li hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the doctor weng chiang throws a fit savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum on this score weng chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one s workplace it doesn t help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he s presumably impersonating so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing all in all though this is an enjoyable adventure the doctor is at his sleuthing best leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting and anyway li hsen more than makes up for weng chiang s deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show while the cyborg assassin mr sin is genuinely creepy \( especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls \) so this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt or a dash of soy sauce rather,positive

this is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl it is better than the average for this genre due to several factors mostly it is because is well done the subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here instead the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy the time of the film is the 50s society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will in this case the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen he is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on the nice girl meanwhile the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek the geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits the loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special the unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch everyone winds up happy except the town bully rich boy it is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that kelly preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off doug mckeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself catherine mary stewart is the nice girl that i wish had lived next door to me and jami gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle the cast is rounded out by chris nash each does a good job in the role teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results it was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured,positive

unsympathetic hollywood s classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s film noir of this era is associated with a low key black and white visual style that has roots in german expressionist cinematography while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hard boiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the united states during the depression the term film noir \( french for black film \) first applied to hollywood movies by french critic nino frank in 1946 was unknown to most of the american filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film featuring top performances from the 40s and 50s with outstanding drama and screenplays along with a

david cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of stephen king s novel and christopher walken was superb in his portrayal of johnny smith \( no middle initial \) the supporting cast added to the film martin sheen was a convincing greg stilson \( was this a warm up for his west wing role \) i m a big fan of tom skerritt and i didn t recognize herbert lom from his pink panther role this movie \( and the book \) are put in the horror genre but i would consider the story to be true science fiction smith s character was in a coma for several years and the story s premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities there is nothing supernatural about the villains they re just normal bad people this movie is not completely faithful to the movie some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie \( 104 minutes \) instead of a 400 page novel some of the changes add moderate suspense keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first i do question the need for some of the changes i don t know why johnny smith s psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie \( he could learn things touching people s clothes or a geographic spot in the book \) and i didn t think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book \( this made for what i considered weaker parts of the movie \) true science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person puts them in an abnormal situation and thus investigates the person s character due to the time constraints of the movie it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience smith had but they were not absent either as a result the story \( both book and movie \) have a feel of a classic tragedy this movie is not for children though it could have easily gained a pg rating \( this movie came out the year before pg 13 was introduced \) the r rating was gained by one usage of the f word a couple of seconds of a revealed breast and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character \( cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies like scanners videodrome and the 1986 remake of the fly this movie had him more subdued but very effective \) besides the r rating there are aspects of the story \( equally true in the novel as in the movie \) that i find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister this is because of its dependence on situation ethics adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of johnny smith because of the situations in spite of these misgivings i think this was an excellent movie i think it was worthy of several awards such as acting nominations for walken and sheen for adapted screenplay and for best picture,positive

i followed texhnolyze through it s fansubs waited patiently for each dvd to come out you don t have to sit and ponder look hard and deep to find a meaning in texhnolyze it hits you right in the face from the beginning there are some people out there that society likes to forget likes to shove to the backburners and ignore in this tale they are a whole race of people the people of the underground city of lux and even within them sides are chosen you re either in or your out ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows the only thing he knows his strength his brute force this point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes when ichise makes the decision to protect ran he s come to feel something for the girl and perhaps in a way she reminds him of the mother he could never save so he goes to offer the only thing he s sure of having his body that s always been his bargaining chip always been what everyone wanted anger rage and fighting though are all ichise knows how do you expect him to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him become it s clear through most of the show that he doesn t know how to react to people likewise it s the same old sort of theme out of many a popular sci fi movie man bringing about an end to his own world ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by his texhnolyze ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by some intricate connection but eventually lux collapses because of technology the classic warning given in so many apocalypse movies not each episode requires such in depth searches for meaning it all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the series itself this series as a whole is a very good series it does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes in mind as well as a little psychology but what good series doesn t,positive

warner herzog s grizzly man won the director s guild award for best feature documentary but the people who pass out oscars apparently didn t agree grizzly man was not among this year s nominees for best documentary many of herzog s narrative films such as fitzcaraldo deal with man s attempt to challenge the indifference of nature so grizzly man is not a departure by any means herzog s heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious even bizarre goal timothy treadwell s fixation is on grizzly bears i am one of them he is heard to say he survived in the wild accompanied by a video camera and on at least one occasion by a girlfriend living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting animals rule he said fist defiantly pumping in the air timothy conquered treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life appearing once on david letterman s cbs show but he aspired to more before letting his love of animals consume him he tried his luck in hollywood he got an agent and auditioned for tv and movie roles he was he told his parents second choice for the bartender role on cheers which went to woody harrelson missing out on that opportunity left him crushed what really drove treadwell he reminds me of fey little carson on queer eye for the straight guy and as he openly mentions that it s easier to be gay than straight i wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable grizzly bears i like girls he volunteers but then he mentions various cruising places truck stops men s rooms in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts he was also an alcoholic were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue those who are seen offering their remembrances of treadwell never allude to his sexuality they describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive hippy new age approach to nature and who died as a result the bears to whom he gave names like mr chocolate and tabitha need protection he said and he was their self appointed caretaker others suggest that despite his good intentions he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined after treadwell was eaten by a bear the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at kfc for eating chicken what is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf treadwell was an intruder one mans saystreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits but treadwll knew these were animals trouble is his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from disney cartoons the universe director herzog says is ruled by hostility chaos and murder treadwell had a different philosophy isn t that sad he squeals in his high pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing his pollen thing i love that bee he says partially financed by the discovery channel grizzly man is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans but it s also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because he admitted he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows he also needed to record his solitary life on video we see him crying as he pets a wolf laughing when his command that god make it rain seems to have been obeyed and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals what we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him mercifully the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked the camera was running though and treadwell s screams and the screams of his girlfriend were recorded out of respect for his family herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings instead we see him listening to the audio and his reaction \( telling one of treadwell s friends that she must never listen to it just as she must never see the coroner s photos of the aftermath of the attack \) is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film i had no life treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts now i have a life that life is memorialized in herzog s film brian w fairbank,positive

the reviewer who called this a disney bait switch hit the nail right on the head i too remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid then later on disney channel and was awaiting these to be released on dvd as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together third rate offering i never cared for the elfego baca story i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the swamp fox episodes above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war who with his compatriots probably contributed as much as george washington thomas jefferson or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom i really loved this story just for itself not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set i have even gone as far as removing it from my wish list to save the funds of my family and friends as well i shall wait to see hopefully if disney will ever release the entire swamp fox story in a complete set for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price,negative

i really enjoyed goodbye lenin and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that i decided to watch this one the film follows three idealistic politically right on young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking selfish and uncaring bourgeois consumer society this rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses moving their furniture around and leaving notes like you are too wealthy very situationist \( never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into \) all this is fine and well but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich ignorant bourgeois pig in the first ten minutes or so i thought this might be a clever bit of directing in which we view society as seen through their eyes rather than society in its reality however this wasn t to be the case the world remained bourgeois the kids are alright the older generation bourgeoise are bare cyphers and none \( with the exception of the man they kidnap \) is given anything like a personality when a break in goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there and take him away to a shack in the hills during this time they decide to educate him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man s part in them the rich man barely challenges the young people at all and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong the anti capitalist argument running through the entire film is very one sided i could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced but this wasn t furthermore there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work the edukators are young good looking and artistic the subtext being that because they are arty they can see things that others can t at one point one of the characters is on a bus when three men \( presumably police though its not made clear \) hassle a drunk for not having a ticket the character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone gives the drunk his ticket and gets off the bus do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police can t say that s my experience amybe they do in germany this is a recurring problem with the film situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic the anarchist marxist anti capitalist dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless by the end of the film you don t actually know what exactly they stand for or what their solutions are to the problems of society basically the one sided political argument hamstrings the characters development their views are never challenged so they don t change it is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film the ending is also unbeleivably cynical and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film generally it feels like a script written by a 1st year politics student being so utterly simplistic in it s the rich are all bad message i would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society but at the same time i wouldn t recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world s problems there has been a rash of good political films lately good night and good luck syriana the constant gardener unfortunately and given so much potential this film is not one of them shame,negative

china the panda adventure is an imax film that tells a story so in a sense the pandas are a part of this story but not in the sense of a documentary the story is set in 1936 and is based on a true story involving ruth harkness who has arrived in china to take care of the business affairs of her late husband her husband it seems was a great admirer of the giant panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them this leads ruth to seek these pandas out to see for herself as the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of china the cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well ruth is played by the lovely maria bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the panda all in all this film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family but be warned it s more of a story involving the panda and not a documentary,positive

i would argue that since we really haven t evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out and despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace in mary harron s american psycho it comes out in all the wrong places the film is a character study of one patrick bateman \( christian bale \) a wall street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him it s not just the suits and the empty conversations either it is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card he tries to talk about his problems he really does but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period to their ears murders and executions is interchangeable with mergers and acquisitions the film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980 s this particular gordon gekko is overdone and overacted by christian bale in a great performance he is robotic phony arrogant and absurd he is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so \( all the while flexing his biceps \) more than anything he is militantly materialistic he is dexter mixed with jim profit only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co workers head the whole point which is made clear in the final scene is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts just because these people make enough cash to swim in scrooge mcduck style doesn t mean that their behavior is excusable harron paints the modern businessman as an american psycho and it is all too fitting to make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off you must be turned into patrick bateman the film is a great success as a horror movie villain patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever every scene has great energy to it and even though bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can t stop watching him there is something of a conflict presented when willem dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of patrick s murders that storyline is interesting while it lasts but it is never quite wrapped up i would also admit that after awhile i got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters he may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but i eventually did the character is endlessly fascinating \( what is up with his love of cheesy 80 s music \) and the scene where he kills paul allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized the male need for aggression isn t going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it otherwise we are going to have a lot more patrick bateman s and iraq wars on our hands 3,positive

i saw this back in 1985 when if first came out it was wonderful at first i thought it was going to be one of those historical tourist shows but it wasn t it could have been though mr wood is a very charismatic presenter but is what s better is that he took the story of the story of the trojan war from the pages of modern myth to reality i have read homer and i knew about schlieman but other than that i was ignorant of the trojan war mr wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level i was fascinated by the connection he made to the hittite empire the thought had never occurred to me that if a troy did exist it might have trade relations with empires to the east he also included experts in the fields of archeology modern history and history of the period i thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times i also have the alexander dvd and shakepeare in search of shakespeare was fun wood took the story of shakespeare down to the center of his human story i would recommend all the wood in search of programs if you can t find the films then read the books the books are just are entertaining,positive
what can a single lie do that is the question that is examined in lillian hellman s the children s hour martha \( shirley maclaine \) and karen \( audrey hepburn \) run a small boarding school in a small new england town karen is engaged to a local doctor \( james garner \) when karen punishes a malicious student the little girl decides to get revenge the way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by martha s aunt \( miriam hopkins \) to complicate matters she blackmails another girl \( veronica cartwright \) into confirming the story this lie immediately destroys the martha and karen s school but their life s are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected but when the lie exposed it is too little too late when the play opened in the late 50 s it was daring and very controversial when the film opened in 1961 it was still controversial but 40 years later it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an oscar nomination if she hadn t made breakfast at tiffany s that year shirley maclaine was fresh off her success in the apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs she proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy but it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role \( the turning point \) fay bainter and miriam hopkins were major character actors in the 30 s and 40 s and were given one final chance to show what they had left bainter received an oscar nomination for this film william wyler had nothing to prove in the 60 s yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles this was another triumph for him dvd extras none,positive

having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film do not watch this film it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person do not watch this film,negative

i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio,negative
instead of reviewing the content my review is based more on the dvd presentation pros the dolby digital 5 1 soundtrack is just excellent with great separation of instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds for more that just audience cheering sound is only second to the shakira unplugged dvd cons who ever mastered this dvd must be living in 1997 this concert was recorded in hd and is usually shown on mtv hd network the big mistake being that the concert is not anamorphic \( enhanced for 16x9 televisions \) sure the majority will not care but for those of you who own hd monitors you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the fact that you have to manually zoom in second negative being that if you want to start the concert from a specific song you have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead because if you try to start from the song selection menu it will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected ends overall a great concert but a disappointing dvd presentation,positive
this out of all the many versions of jane eyre has to be my least favorite granted samantha morton has a very adorable fairy elfin like face like mr rochesters description of her but her acting has no highs and lows she stands up to mr edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers seemingly no respect to her employer which is not fault of hers the writing of the script is bad and so the direction ciaran hinds is totally over the top he is so angry with no understanding his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed he is not at all like the character described in brontes epic book of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the innocence and singular personality of earnest honest and yet strong sweet jane eyre that charlotte bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words the over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical to me there is no love feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust he seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl and she though supposedy a virgin she dosn t act like one plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story especially during janes childhood i do also miss the gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the dalton clarke mini series which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story if you want to see great versions i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version that movie truly captured the spirit and feel it is moody dark and mysterious another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story dalton s and clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime however if you are like me see them all and make your own decision they all have something to offer and most are entertaining,negative

this could have been one of the best films of the 80 s all of the components are there ford gives the best acting of his career the production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today s standards two things however really bring this movie down the major negative here i believe is polanski s insistence on starring emmanuelle seigner this is one of the sexiest women i have ever seen grace a film but it is the understatement of the year to say that she can t act at all in fact i think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance i have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys ford s performance when the film was over i thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here the first half is dynamite the second with seigner is a totally different beast your average stupid kid thriller watch this film and dare contradict my statement here get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part it s so bad that ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in ok the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up there is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where ford and seigner would be time and time again it really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot they were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story i am really kind of mad with polanski here he destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made and this statement comes from one who worships the ground polanski walks on,negative

i give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer this movie is not bram stoker s dracula but a rip off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story if it was named something else or even kept the name dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name i d give it 5 stars if you want to see the real dracula story first read the actual book by bram stoker then watch the silent film nosferatu nosferatu is the only dracula movie that gets the story right dracula is a monster he s not a star crossed lover at all and wasn t intended to be people wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn t one it s a horror tale not a vieled porn book and certainly not a love story if anything the ones that fail to understand dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him,negative
i ve had the opportunity to watch the movie stealth over the past week it was on tv here otherwise i don t think i would have watched it my instincts would have been correct an action technothriller stealth has a predictable plot a new elite team of 3 good looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots including a disrespect for authority mayhem ensues people die the leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence and they work together to save the female pilot who s gone down in north korea the plot direction and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads \( josh lucas jessica biel jamie foxx \) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart i m sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads and came away disappointed me i was expecting little so i guess my expectations were met though i will say i was amused by the last line,negative

i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio,negative

20 minutes into this movie i was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based the actress playing cleopatra protrays her as petulent spoiled and immature whereas in the book one saw cleopatra as highly astute regal and concerned first about her country and its people in the movie she handed egypt to ceasar eagerly whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to rome likewise dalton portrays ceasar as a complete perhaps if this were not based on margaret george s memiors of cleopatra i would be more kind in my review but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second rate film maker s idea of good story telling at 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most but if you really want to learn about this queen read the book instead,negative
200 american is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy even though it looks like a no budget episode of queer as folk or intended to be a gay version of pretty woman it s got a pretty good story it doesn t rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography most of the actors are straight playing gay roles i was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show something that i can certainly relate to the acting is acceptable but not great because most of the actors are not that experienced i was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer the movie has some kind of charm about it perhaps it s because it s so sincere and gimmick free and even the love scenes are very low key i was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss there is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor it s very captivating sean matic did a good job with his light austrilian accent by the way it s worth rental fee for sure,positive
my major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires these extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u v lamp vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun vampires are supposed to be scary but how frightened of them should i be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable the first underworld movie would be a good model,negative

this comment may contain spoilers anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it i ve encountered enough people over the course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories this has been satirized on the simpsons which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness anyone who has read the book its based on the incredible i am legend by richard matheson knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise and even that is not followed too closely all of the criticisms of the omega man are valid it is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably ludicrously cheesy the villains who should have been more terrifying than even romero s zombies are just crazed albino hippie luddites and the last half of the film once chuck hooks up with rosalind cash and the kiddies is really a let down but the scenes that open the film of heston hefting a cool looking machine gun while decked out in austin powers style finery \( \) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch this was the second movie after 1959 s the world the flesh and the devil to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash after years of seeing this on tv a guaranteed late september or early october event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my pacific northwest childhood in the old dark ages before cable tv and the videocassette revolution its nice to see this movie on dvd with a beautiful widescreen transfer it looks and sounds great as a child i always liked the music particularly the surprise party theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance it rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory,positive

steven spielberg s classic masterpiece jaws did not have a stellar plot it was a bubblegum storyline a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast in the hands of any other director it would have been a terrible film something to laugh at on lonely saturday nights while chowing down popcorn in the hands of mr spielberg however it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made steven spielberg s hands were nowhere near jaws the revenge okay so here s the plot remember jaws 3 d well that never happened chief brody from the first movie is dead his wife ellen brody \( lorraine gary \) is living a happy life in amity until her youngest son is killed by a great white shark ellen flies down to the bahamas with her other son michael brody \( lance guest \) though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy ellen believes that the shark from the first movie yes the one that chief brody killed is back for revenge hunting down her family and killing them one by one even though it died in the first movie confused any sensible moviegoer would be it s best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third jaws sequel as you now know the story is completely absurd the script by michael de guzman is unintentionally hilarious filled with outrageously funny dialogue for example in one scene pilot hoagie \( played by michael caine \) is courting ellen brody hoagie i have an irresistible urge to kiss you ellen brody ellen why hoagie because it would not occur to you why and if that s not confusing enough for you feast upon this nugget of dialogue from a conversation between michael and ellen brody ellen why did you come out here why did you come out here michael mom mom why did you take the boat ellen it the shark kept coming michael don t you realize what you re doing ellen i ve tried to tell you there was nothing else to do michael mom you shouldn t have done it ellen i ve tried to tell you i ve tried joseph sargent s directing is terrible it s clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing which may be why the acting is so horrible the highlight of the cast is lance guest whose straight faced performance overshadows the very talented michael caine s by a longshot the horrid acting is forgivable however after all how could someone even attempt to keep a straight face in a film so absurd a film in which sharks roar swim from new england to the bahamas to kill family members and leap thirty feet out of the water on the plus side jaws the revenge is enormously fun to watch thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity it is very likely one of the worst films ever made jaws 3 d looks like the original when compared to this film but if there s nothing else on tv some late night grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is jaws the revenge,negative
let me start by saying that i love this movie and love fulci this was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it \( let me explain \) this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me when i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from city i was shocked when i watched the nipple scene in ripper i was shocked watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest \( im sorry \) the only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned which honestly i enjoyed more zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest \( isnt that why we watch fulci flicks,positive
millionaire fredrick loren played by a young vincent price invites five strangers to a party in the house on haunted hill with his delectable wife annabel in tow he has set the strangers a task of sorts if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them 10 000 each however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted one of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing at midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the house on haunted hill takes on a life of its own but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun i enjoyed this film it wasn t overly suspenseful but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then the special effects were none existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house all in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same,positive
fyodor dostoyevsky s nineteenth century novella notes from underground and the plot of this twenty first century movie carry identical messages the movie is an eloquent cinematic adaptation of the novel that gives dostoevsky s central character a new breath of life from the modern day perspective the movie attempts to survey the convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video taped self confession the psychological similarities between the character in dostoevsky s novel and the building supervisor in the movie are uncanny both characters share a state of mind that is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest the character in the movie who identifies himself as a sick man a spiteful man lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts he despises his friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his relationship with them the character in the movie voluntarily creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self demise he often finds himself confined within the conflicting walls of his consciousness he falls in love with a prostitute but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession and tries to dominate her by escalating the level of his thought process well above the habitual human awareness the central character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that dostoevsky s narrator identifies as the men of action the building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just like the narrator in dostoevsky s novel dostoevsky s novel and the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of self consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a methodical process of uniformity and conformity has a negative side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds,positive

when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each husband killing wife after wife a man who enjoys murder and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it if you don t heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny \( i wouldn t take it for free \),negative
with the straight story lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love this film felt like a blind date gone bad the straight story showed up david lynch arrived but the rest of the date felt muddled confusing and utterly disastrous everything in this film seemed wrong lynch s choice for lead actor the bland sissy spacek the filler of repeat cornfield montages all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read i just felt that nobody had control over this picture yet the randomness \( and the possible tear ending \) gave critics something to smile about this is not a david lynch film and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive twin peaks or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois it just seemed repetitive and boring what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose alvin lying on the ground because he can t get up the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame spacek s depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors then to add more fuel to the fire there was richard farnsworth again he isn t a horrible actor but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically but alas couldn t master it mentally farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen i couldn t tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime i saw it as babble \( and no i am not that insensitive i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger more professional actor \) the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant i wanted lynch to either go 100 for this film or none at all but alas it felt as if he just half ed his way through this heap speaking of david lynch where did he go in this film there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns looking at america class i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film instead of keeping us by alvin s side throughout his journey lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while but when the same images were used over and over again i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin but the stock footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way alvin was a walking storybook filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well lynch made alvin very closed minded which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature alvin was a strong character but i needed more with this story i wanted him to make choices learn new things and bring that to his brother s table when they eventually met i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin and not vice versa overall i wasn t stunned by this picture i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just played it safe the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin speaking of alvin why couldn t he have been a stronger better rounded character i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america but instead gave us nothing more than soft music recycled images and stock characters the stories were interesting to listen to but brought nothing fresh to the table i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye \( since i have a brother as well \) but why couldn t we focus on this further lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan when it was the central focus of this film the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch but instead it felt jagged and old i could suggest one viewing for this film any further and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be grade out of,negative

i lived through the vietnam era if you did you can t ever forget this guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong why it went wrong and what we can learn to keep from repeating it for me here was the most unforgettable moment decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days macnamara tells him we the americans were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china the north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said mr macnamara you must have never read a history book we ve been fighting the chinese for a thousand years we aren t their puppet we were fighting for our national freedom we would have fought to the last man macnamara says they almost came to blows here s the point macnamara says as compared to say the soviets we didn t understand the north vietnamese we didn t really know enought about them we had no idea what was in their minds and that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons that s why we lost does any of this sound familiar this is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age it s that good and that informative of course it won t be widely viewed by the american public we ll go our goofy way coveting our big screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things like sporting events,positive

after reading a couple of other reviews about the quality of transfer on this dvd i decided i wanted this in my collection what i thought would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality i was very dissapointed the quality of transfer of the picture is horrible a great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality non anamorphic deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered picture tones are very very bad along with what little color that is desplayed almost a black white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv it still was so dark it almost wasn t worth continue watching the only things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and suppossedly in dolby digital ex the beginning dolby intoduction was deffinatly in dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn t distributeand dolby sounds that i could make out on my theatre sound system sounded like mono to me thsi dvd reproduction stinks and i suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this goodtimes video version untill it is put on dvd correctly why they botherd is beyond me because i wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen i am taping it on to vhs for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow i suppsoe i ll have to be content that i got the widscreen version on vhs for now untill they re release it on dvd with better quality or they show it on tv in widescreen which i highly doubt heck even taping it off tv you d get a better picture quality than this dvd,negative

if your a fan of progressive rock you probably already know how good this cd is in my mind it is the single greatest cd of all time \( followed closely by operation mindcrime any of the great pink floyd and rush records \) my only complaint on this dvd is the sound i was at this show and the sound at the theater was great somewhere it didn t transfer to the recording it is not the worst thing i have ever heard but it doesn t show the bands power live every other aspect of this dvd is well worth the price i would not want to be with out it,positive
i watched this dvd in one of my classes and it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless i really dont know what to think about the whole presentation the presence of chomsky makes it look reputable but who knows he might have been taken out of context although it seemed not if what they claim about corporations is true then we are getting ready to implode in one way or another i ll keep away from political lines and just suggest that you watch it and decide i had given it a rating of 3 but just changed it to 4 the material is more plausible than otherwise,positive
this was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film i kept looking at my watch the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about william shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama my girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but i wasn t in the mood she forced me to watch this the film was about a struggling young writer shakespeare played by joseph fiennes who falls in love with lady viola played by gwyneth paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play romeo and juliet this film also won a couple of oscars including gwyny for best actress but i felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old english style thats hard to understand overall the film was just o k i think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and judi dench was great as queen elizabeth but i never want to watch this film again if your a shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than i did,negative
as part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that i have missed over the past few years i came across this clunker i understand of course that i am not the target demographic here most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity unfortunately i was looking for an actual cinematic experience four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named dr von doom \( who wins the award for the most obvious name for a villain ever \) they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers \( now we re talking \) thanks to some chemical filled cloud what follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show we get the thing caving in the front of a semi truck with his shoulder as the money shot but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified an entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers but since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered and succeed destruction for the fans no consequences for the characters but why would director tim story try anyways he knows the people are just showing up to ogle at jessica alba as she pretends to act so instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame he should have just directed a pepsi commercial with jessica alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess the plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble they aren t even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie they go out show off their powers \( in things like extreme sports you know for the kids \) and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough there is also a lackluster love triangle between sue storm \( jessica alba \) reed richards \( ioan gruffudd \) and dr von doom \( julian mcmahon \) i m sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like jessica alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful all wealthy dr von doom but chances are if you re chasing someone that looks like her she s not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career so why is my rating so high above the zero i ve been talking it up to be well it is what it is it didn t put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly it was fun watching tv actors such as michael chiklis and julian mcmahon try their luck at a hollywood blockbuster and at least it wasn t catwoman but what it was was insulting beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe jessica alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid story thinks we are at a newsstand on the cover of people magazine there is a picture of sue storm now if stephen hawkings can t make it to the cover of people then what chance does this two bit scientist have 1 4,negative

in a movie such as this only james cameron could do it justice this documentary follows one of the most haunting disasters in the history of sea travel and for that reason everything had to be perfect and it was the special effects are unparalleled and the intricacy of the technological advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the movie this probably could have gotten the remaining 0 5 points \( going by the kab scale of course \) except i was really hoping that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the ship which i believe was supposed to be located a half mile away from the bow section the kab score 9 5,positive

if you have read harmon s acting resume online then you know she has talent she has the training and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along but being a mild conservative \( angie is a republican \) in liberal hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at good advice was bad advice for her it is miscast with two annoying stars sheen and richards and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie it has no redeaming values at all and angie deserves better roles then this this movie was made by artiscan films which recently went into bankruptcy and is now lions gate films their films are still bad no matter the name change and i still wait to see a better movie come to angie harmon,negative
seinfeld season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit 1 in the nielsen ratings this was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as jerry elaine george and kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode george s parents frank and estelle costanza as well as jerry s parents morty and helen seinfeld and newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as mr pitt david puddy and kenny bania amazingly the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics and while jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors his work improved a lot during this season disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes the big salad and the pledge drive as well as the hysterical classic the couch the chinese woman and the gymnast are also very good episodes both showing the continuing neuroses of the costanzas the sitcom always seems to have great episodes on disc 2 and this is no exception with the soup the switch where we finally learn kramer s first name and the race all being classic episodes disc 3 is also top notch featuring the excellent the scofflaw the kiss hello and the doorman also known as the bro as well as the two part highlights of 100 episode disc 4 starts out with the classic episode the jimmy which earned michael richards an emmy for best supporting actor the excellent the fusili jerry and the strong season finale the understudy which mirrors the tonya harding nancy kerrigan fiasco only with bette midler of all people playing the victim as usual the extras are just as strong as the episodes the running with the egg featurette that shows how an episode of seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the seinfeld series the bloopers are also very funny from this season especially the ones from the fusili jerry episode the deleted scenes inside looks exclusive stand up material and the notes about nothing are also top notch although not quite on the level of season 4 which was their best season season 6 was another great season for seinfeld as the writing was still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all cylinders highly recommended,positive
maybe the most engaging documentary ever made brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry producer robert evans giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that i could only describe as psychedelic being a film fanatic for the last 43 years i was shocked and ashamed to find that i had not heard of robert evans in all my reading of credits over the years i had somehow missed his name i had remembered seeing william castle s name at the beginning of rosemary s baby but not evan s then at finding out that he was the driving force behind love story the godfather the godfather pt 2 chinatown and one of my personal favorites the president s analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good well i was just dumbfounded and these are just a fraction of the films he s produced of course he didn t start as a producer he had been in women s apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today while lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by norma shearer lauching his career into show biz it seems he knows everybody and i mean everybody after watchng this extraordinary film i called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality i queried have you ever heard of robert evans anxiously awaiting a no so i could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity he replied you mean bob evans yes indeed it seems he knows everybody my father had come across him in his days as a buyer for macy s i asked do you know what he does now he s some sort of movie director or something now isn t he dad answered i bought him the audiobook evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name his voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess he also lent his voice to the short lived hysterically irreverent cartoon series kid notorious that still airs on comedy central all in all whether you know evans or not this is a fascinating beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than thalberg s and selznick s combined the story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on this is a must see for anyone interested in tinseltown ps i don t usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc what a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody ask your dad who knows,positive
this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama i will not give away the plot although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it basically clooney s character mr ocean a career burgler is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino so he recruits 11 men each with a talent to add to the operation this is where the trouble begins the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters there is almost no introduction to many of them and barely even a mention of their names literally half an hour into the film the eleven are assembled and they re already robbing the casino how s that for plot development and that s basically it ladies and gentlemen go to vegas rob casino go home movie over some of the good guys are even outright repellant our would be heros enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon am i supposed to like this fat weasel the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr ocean is that the guy he s robbing the casion owner is a really bad guy supposedly he has people killed n stuff \( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 \) but we never see any real evil deeds in fact he just seems like a handsome polite very prosperous businessman he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film mr ocean on the other hand and his cohorts are career criminals but the guy they re robbing is an even greater criminal you see so that makes it ok and really if you were being robbed wouldn t you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt they re such nice guys that makes getting robbed fun just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy how thrilling this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung like a boxing match which are essentially irrelevent throughout there seems to be vital information missing \( like say a plot \) soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts this film is also horribly cut several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced and then completely forgotten about take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino s owner makes an appearence the folder he has just been handed explains pitt contains secret security codes you would think that would be something important right you would think they will need to get those codes well wrong in fact you won t hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development and that happens all the time in this movie in fact mr ocean s team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties \( and boy they started repelling down that shaft quick didn t they you didn t even know they were robbing the place yet wow these guys are good or maybe steven soderbergh is as over rated as his film \) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7 eleven this after mr ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have one would hope this film would at least end strong but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed we are left wondering whether the eleven actually got away with their caper or worse what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light hearted the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd \( as did the actors in their commentary \) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad but this film comes very close to 1 star this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product it is big on budget big on bling and low on story i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time this is as good a way to do it as any personally i would rather have a story with more substance,negative

i don t often watch foreign films the reason being as an american i don t feel that i can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works french spanish german etc regardless of nationality genre or time period they generally leave me cold with that in mind i went into this with no doubts as to the film s greatness but again didn t think as an american i would be able to see it as the situational nuances would be lost on me as it turned out i was wrong and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily and didn t seem obtuse or foreign the experience could best be likened to watching the graduate as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching i won t recap the storyline or discuss details of the movie itself i just wanted to say that i went into this skeptical expecting to find a picture that i couldn t relate to but what i found was an immediate compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition,positive

all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane s life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane s life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is at best an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice accused murder suspect in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane s extracurricular activities my interest in the film was as a hogan s heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six year series bob crane s professional credits alone would make for a good film auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane s so called secret life and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane s private life auto focus however should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan s heroes television series,negative

i ve always been a fan of roger moore s james bond but what i ve discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were like actually good the spy who loved me is not one of them oh sure it s fun almost all of the bond flicks are fun but it s basically just a kid s movie and that s not necessarily a good thing \( 1 \) stromberg is a lame villain yes his underwater lair is well designed but it s silly not as silly as that ice palace in die another day but pretty silly \( 2 \) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls she s not an ugly woman to be sure but she was a terrible actress she sounds like she s reading poorly from a cue card in ever single scene she s in \( 3 \) jaws is a stupid character having metal teeth wouldn t actually make you capable of biting through metal the metal you were biting would resist and you d end up just tearing up your gums i don t expect realism from 007 movies but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic \( that said jaws is effectively used and richard kiel was excellent in the role \) \( 4 \) the disco score is terrible terrible \( 5 \) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of you only live twice but on the ocean rather than in space certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies embarrassing i love bond but this is not one of the highlights the dvd is good with a couple of fine documentaries but the commentary track grates because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did even if that were true it d be annoying,negative

this is a rather peculiar film for seagal and the first thing that should be pointed out to any seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief in fact they are extraordinarily brief though thankfully free of wirefu though out of reach is by no means a total failure \( it s actually pretty entertaining seagal as always is fun to watch and some of the scenes are well done \) the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes this film is a drama about a nature nut \( seagal \) who roams the forest looking for injured animals he has a pen pal in poland a young girl and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her this brings up the main problem with this film namely a lot of it simply doesn t make any sense it turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring and seagal goes through the motions to save her as per usual with seagal nowadays he obviously refused to actually finish the production and so we have the usual dubbing problem here it is even more salient than usual in this picture however for here we have not one but several different people dubbing seagal s voice none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him here the most frequently heard fill in for seagal sounds like a knock off benecio del toro with a much higher pitched voice as you can imagine the effect is very humorous as stated above the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn t make sense which was apparently realized by the director as he has in many scenes the voice fill in for seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking how obnoxious seagal s character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal which she later uses to communicate with seagal what makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for seagal the villian ineptly played by matt schultz sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for seagal to find in one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code \( apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means this is a trap \) the villain sees her doing this and instead of destroying the message \( which would make sense \) later has it delivered to seagal huh in a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling seagal where she is the villian sees her doing it comments on how clever she is but then leaves the message there are also quite of few mistakes in this film several of which are laughably obvious at the beginning and end of this film for example seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head during the rest of the film however he has short hair at the end after some bs macho dialogue about how seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing schultz slowly each character uncocks his pistol even though schultz s pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock and even though in the very next closeup seagal s pistol is still cocked after a sword fight which ends on a classic move from older chambara films notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor and that then all of a sudden there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters in the finale the above mentioned sword fight the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than seagal this brings up another frequent complaint of many seagal fans his overuse of stunt doubles it s almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn t even film his own fight scenes now have you ever noticed that in lord steven s early films when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves now what happens the camera gets as close as possible shows some shots of his face grunting shows some arms playing paddycake then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing seagal s face ever wonder why it s because surprise surprise that s not seagal doing the fighting in the gun fight which is actually a very decent action scene watch seagal as he enters the room his character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll which is probably the simplest move in aikido though it is obvious that it is not seagal doing the roll what is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film which shows seagal s character roaming the forest looking for injured animals or whatever it is clearly not seagal that we see walking through the forest was he afraid that he d trip over a branch and injure himself was he afraid he d be attacked by an injured animal in the woods i don t know what is likely the case is that seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after the fact using another actor in order to make the film work i m really not bashing seagal i m merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could very easily be fixed be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when seagal goes to the post office the postal worker calls seagal mr delacraw or some such bizarre name even though his character s name is actually billy ray lancing seagal then proceeds to mumble some french to the man and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent this scene is downright strange what is also strange is how seagal is dressed in this scene like some kind of new orleans anne rice fan vampire wannabe in a strange black fur coat i don t know at least it s good for a laugh if seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable the only truly schocking thing is that this hasn t happened yet he shows up late to shoots leaves early refuses to finish productions and yet people keep hiring the man he repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production he needs to start finishing his films in closing out of reach only has two very brief fight scenes but they are somewhat well done seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human,negative
who would give the green light to this it is a total remake of the 1968 classic the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it it pales in comparison to the original this was really weird to remake this movie dawn of the dead was cool b c it had a new fresh spin to the story this has no scares no atmosphere no innovations and no riveting performances skip this one,negative
they just don t have movies like this anymore this is not a movie that makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen this is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past charlie sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war this seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie he finds out alright keith david plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role he cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked the supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here overall this is my favorite movie of all time it has stood the test of time and never fails when i want to see a good movie i just have the old special edition not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice it has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film there is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when i saw this i was mroe than glad i got the special edition you would nto believe what the actors went through it is a great making of,positive

there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama revenge films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end whilst the victim or top billed actor actress comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed the lines could have been written the night before and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic the violins would always shrill around kiefer and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement no frills nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end where did eye for an eye go wrong i don t think i need to count all the ways for you but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic what was sally field s job i know that is a small detail but it better highlights my complaint that our central family \( the mccanns \) were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed ed harris literally walked through his character proving that field s husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion the only character worth watching and was developed briefly was kiefer he was 100 evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end yet we didn t even know that much about him either \( which upset me \) schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably didn t even need to read the script and the story played it safe from the beginning but it wasn t what i wanted to see i expected film like this to come out during the 80s not in 1996 it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris sally field phillip baker hall keith david and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan nothing stood out in this film nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it and nothing made me feel excited about these actors this was a literal nothing film it lent nothing to the cinematic world except \( and i stress this a bit \) another peg in a very tired genre known as the revenge thriller after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements which made me think of a high school drama production it was amateur at best but she said that is why directors use sally because she is known for being overly dramatic this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly sally saw success with it once but as she continues it only creates bad cinema there were times during sally s bigger speeches that i found myself laughing i couldn t help myself but her focus on certain words and clich reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn t have to play the outlaying father any further in films he was completely wasted in this film was there any emotion with him i didn t see any then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes also did mantegna take a class on how to be a one dimensional clich urg his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one dimensional police officers again the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself field over dramatized the entire film thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel but alas ole safe schlesinger didn t take us down that darker path i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast yet we chose to stay on the lighted path that coupled with the poor acting just created a film that didn t catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world overall in case it wasn t obvious this wasn t a good movie at all in fact i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the revenge thrill fell into that same pattern the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure this film did not sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight while everyone else was forgettable the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil watch this film for kiefer but nothing else skip it grade out of,negative
if lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them this movie was not scary it would have been suspenseful if i cared for any of the characters you know what the best part was when it was over few movies compel me to write reviews good or bad this one obviously did,negative
appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget cgi enhanced anime theatrical releases have gorgeous visuals but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog trust me i was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you i wanted this to be a great movie \( as i am a fan of the oav animated series \) appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone but that is about all,negative
there is nothing in this dvd that wasn t in the book in fact stan and john basically read the book to you as they show you the pictures from the book i was hoping to actually see the artists do the drawings but there is maybe 60 seconds total of footage of actual drawing the rest of the video is just john buscema tracing over all the images that are already in the book if you really want to learn to draw comics this isn t for you if you just want a basic overview of the process this dvd might not be too disappointing but if you already own the book definitely don t waste your money it would be cheaper just to have your mom read the book to you,negative

i bought this for the jeffrey dahmer and john wayne gacy documentaries like i imagine you might i m not disappointed really i don t regret buying it in any sense it s just that this dvd isn t very good at all it doesn t attempt to make any insight which isn t something i particularly care for anyway what each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers i can t imagine anyone learning something they didn t already know from them it s mostly told through pictures when it seems there s option to use video the dahmer documentary made in 1993 doesn t feature anything of interest there s no interview with his father or anything just a voice telling a story over pictures we ve all seen before with occassional clips of victims families in court the gacy one made in 96 is the same there s also a program made in 1997 on criminal profiling this look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling it s told often with video rather then photos which is good but still they re somewhat boring subjects the criminal profiler dahmer and gacy are all episodes from the a e series investigative reports if you didn t realise the last program is on charles manson it s quite different from the others on the disc made in 1997 it originally aired on television as biography charles manson journey into evil i don t with have any interest in manson but i guess it s ok it features significant interviews with manson and main female members of the family all programs run for about one hour or more i wouldn t reccomend any of them none are good at all i might even describe them as terrible considering what else is out there,negative

i only gave this movie one star because it is against amazon s rules to give it no stars after hearing that this was a christian movie i could not wait to watch it however this movie has nothing in common with christianity quite the contrary this is the most anti christian movie that i have ever seen it promotes murder and other unsurpassable evil the movie started out horribly and just continued to get worse for instance the beginning of the movie was shockingly pornographic in a supposedly christian movie i did not expect to be bombarded with this after seeing this i did not expect that the movie could possibly get worse however i was greatly mistaken later in the movie the main character who was remarkably unsympathetic met several of her christian co workers who were talking about something they called the pearl dream intrigued the main character asked them what this dream was of course they were unable to answer because it is complete nonsense none the less the main character continues to review what her co workers have told her about christianity over the years as the movie plods along generally confusing and boring the viewer she comes to the decision to give up her sinful lifestyle and turn to god when this event transpired i assumed wrongly that from this point forward the film would redeem its beginning and maybe even say something good about christianity this however is where the movie went form being merely bad to astoundingly sacrilegious then the main character and her young daughter set out for the desert due to a vague dream they believed that this was god s will and that he would appear in the desert and take them to heaven in other words rapture them how they came to this assumption i was never quite sure the movie often made ludicrous statements which never made the slightest amount of sense i became extremely weary trying to deduce what was happening nothing that took place in this movie was remotely biblical nor was it well explained as time passed our characters continued to sit in the desert boring the viewer to tears they begin to suspect that god was not coming to gather them to heaven and they started to despair this is where the movie became intolerably anti christian the mother took her daughter up to a mountain and asked her to kneel she then forced her daughter to pray after the prayer was concluded she took a gun from her dress and shot her crying daughter supposedly to send her to heaven she believes that she is doing god s will obviously she was such an idiot that she failed to read that the bible that strictly forbids murder afterwards she is sent to prison where we hope to see her suffer for her cruel viscous and insurmountably stupid act as she is sitting in her cell blaming god for the murder of her daughter that she willingly committed \( if she had half a brain cell she would have realized that she was doing satan s will not god s \) she hears trumpets and the cell walls start to fall in a few scenes pass in which the ghost of her daughter returns and tries to redeem her faith she however refuses then she is taken to a dark room that the viewer is supposed to believe is some supernatural place where judgment takes place and asks if she loves god she replies no because she blames him for her insanity the film concludes with her standing stupidly in a dark room that failed to represent eternity most of the aspects included in the film were never explained such as the significance of the pearl dream nor was it explained why they believed that they needed to wait in the desert how did they contrive this ridiculous idea from a vague ambiguous and utterly vapid dream anyway none of these questions were ever answered this caused the film to feel incomplete the stories between scenes shifted so drastically that i suspected i had missed several important scenes after checking my dvd i realized that i had not accidentally skipped crucial scenes because their were none this film was deliberately ambiguous and vapid also the special effects cinematography and acting were about as good as a preschool play none of the actors put any emotion into their roles they recited their lines like drugged zombies i suppose even they realized it was complete rubbish and decided not to put much effort into it to state the obvious this film is a disgrace obviously it is not biblically based it does not represent christian philosophy which is to love others not to wander around aimlessly in the desert acting like a fool nor do christians promote murder as this film implied this movie has as much religious value as night of the blind nazi zombies i am ashamed to see that such a complete travesty is labeled a christian film this film is extremely anti christian its main objective is to give the world the false impression that fundamentalist christians are brainwashed and are incapable of sane thoughts this is not true and yes i can prove it all the proof that you need is contained in the bible if you stop hardening your heart and truly listen with an open mind then you cannot help but to see jesus loving message for the world he does not desire to bring misery to the world but happiness and love the reason that there is misery in the world is because people like those who made this film disobey god if we followed his loving rules then we would not suffer i do not write this rather long review out of hatred as i am sure many will accuse me of i write this to warn people what this movie is really about it is not a true christian movie like the left behind s and the passion of the christ and yes i am aware that i will be bombarded by a slough of negative votes however i do not even faintly care my beliefs as a fundamentalist christian and my love of god is more important to me than a number on a page also i was shocked to read the other reviews on this forum especially the one from the wiccan woman who said that she wished to see christians thrown to the lions as they were in the time of the romans i have seen a lot of hatred in my life but her review was by far the worst i have ever see christians love the world and those in it we do not tell non christians about christ to imply that we are holier than thou because we are not all are equal under god s eyes we are all sinners and the only way to attain redemption is to accept god s undeserved grace we tell other people about god s undeserved love because we want to save them and see them living in eternal joy in heaven we do not rejoice to see people unsaved we tell them about their condition because we want to see them saved in other words we tell people because we love them also for those of you who accuse christians of having a hatred of the world why do you spew hatred in everything you say toward christians aren t you displaying the hatred that you claim you abhor in conclusion this is the worst movie ever made it is anti christian immensely sacrilegious poorly acted poorly written vapid mind numbingly dull disjointed tortuously long etc in short this film is an abomination it is massively offensive to christians and is a massive misrepresentation of christian values also the acting is abysmal and the story line hopelessly confusing if you wish to watch a film that accurately portrays christian values then i recommend watch the passion of the christ or the left behind movies i hope that this review will help you it was written with love and concern i shall keep you in my prayers have a wonderful new year in christ ravenova also recommended the left behind and the ravenloft book series,negative

i saw this crapfest in the theater and i should have known what i was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window but at the entrance of the theater as well i only gave it one star because there wasn t a no star rating even though it deserves a negative rating as a horror fan i was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started it seemed to have alot of promise but once we met baby and her family the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate the movie was disgusting repulsive and made no clear sense at least with michael or freddie you knew what the h ll was going on and i thought that blood sucking freaks and blood sucking vampires from pittsburgh sucked but corpses not only sucked it blew as a friend told me later what in the h ll did you expect from rob zombie what did i expect indeed no wonder most production firms refused to touch this film,negative

the brood is the lightning in the bottle that director david cronenberg has never been able to duplicate while all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them the brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films it is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread there is a pervading coldness about it such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it you want to watch it with the lights on because you re very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights the film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick it warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place this is a very bloody film samantha eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her she is being treated by a creepy oliver reed \( in one of his better performances \) art hindle is her ex husband and he s worried about how she is treating their young daughter after a while that is the least of his worries as these horribly disfigured and \( what the hell are they \) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off samantha eggar i won t say more because part of the horror in a cronenberg film is the pseudo science that he get you to believe in whereas cronenberg s videodrome was weird but not terribly good the brood is one of the creepiest films i ve ever seen and a guilty pleasure \( can i really call it that \) that i choose to subject myself to every so often really what are those things,positive
this is an honestly forgivably slightly too long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three dimensional characters and capture much of war s bad brutality \( but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged nazis \) i love the scenes best where sutherland plays a general and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance with the dozen \( interesting if english jill ireland had been one of the ladies there with charles bronson looking at her which she wasn t but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine \) before i saw the film i heard ernest borgnine was in the movie and i thought he was going to be one of the dozen there is no really solidly likable member of the dozen \( sutherland s probably the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped \) and borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a convict instead they ve got him in a more dull role of a general but what the dozen lack in likability they make up for in interest cassavettes \( whom i strongly physically resemble by the way \) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member of the dozen and he shines best savalas is next best as the lust hating psycho \( hey sex between men and women is needed to produce babies telly or the human race would have ceased to exist a long time ago and the book of genesis talks of man and woman becoming one \) bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just 8 years later he d be the very different vigilante paul kersey of death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler fellow he plays here marvin brilliant in the lead as the head major leading the dozen \( probably even better than the very good john wayne would have been \) nice turn by bob ryan as a decent colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the covert dozen the rest of the cast is mostly very good too very good film,positive
a very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex christian we need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general i wish some brave person would do a film about how christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective this film touched on the subject but it was not really the focus of the documentary perhaps we will be blessed by a further exploration of the subject in the future,positive

like many that have seen this movie i have been a fan of the video game series for years and this movie never disappoints me it has everything that makes re great strong characters interesting story and scenes that make me jump at first it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie but milla jovovich is great as the heroine alice the special effects were really good for this movie the licker and the dogs were really impressive the action is also very entertaining when the action is happening i find myself not being able to turn away it is very fast paced i also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team the red queen was an interesing villain as well maybe even more so than the licker overall this movie is way worth seeing and having if you are a fan or even if you aren t a fan of the games the movie is just fun,positive
this is one of the worst edited documentary i have ever seen you can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes slow motion and unnecessary digital fx i have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min mtv music clip or a tv add but on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick if fine edited all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours each episode has a more than 2 min introduction during the episodes you see some shots more than ten times by the way i am a very long time aviation enthousiast,negative
i have to admit that i actually enjoyed this movie i certainly liked it better than red planet i believe mission to mars to be the better of the two movies it has a stellar cast and i thought good on screen chemistry between the actors most of the special effects were excellent all in all it is a good directorial effort by brian de palma somehow however this has become the movie that viewers love to hate well i am afraid that i disagree as i found it to be a pretty decent sci fi move of course i am partial to this genre of film so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie the premise of this movie is simple a crew is sent on a mission to mars the mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil a new crew of four go on a rescue mission these four tim robbins connie nielsen gary sinise and jerry o connell make up the rescue crew due to problems encountered in space only three of the four make it to mars when they get to mars they find the surviving crew member debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is in fact a giant metallic head made in the image of man therein lies the mystery what they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before the ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies 2001 a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind so i ask you how bad can this movie be on the contrary it is actually pretty good better yet it can be watched by the entire family,positive

mortal kombat annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually hurts to watch it from the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters \( odd considering that in interviews after the first movie all of them said they d want be willing to come back for a sequel \) to the horrible \( even by 1997 standards \) cg effects to the cliched fight scenes \( gee two women in a mud pit i bet it took them all night to come up with that one \) virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie did go wrong with this movie loosely based on the story of the mortal kombat 3 video game \( and set immediately after the first movie which while not great looks like citizen kane compared to this stinkburger \) the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting shao khan \( played by brian thompson the alien bounty hunter from the x files \) and his army \( shown in most scenes as a small band of extras oooh scary \) as they attempt to take over earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as outworld this merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity with only a week to do anything about it lord raiden \( played by james remar replacing the and i can t believe i m saying this much better christopher lambert in the role \) once again enlists the help of liu kang \( robin shou \) sonia blade \( sandra hess \) and princess kitana \( talisa soto \) along with help from a select few other characters from the video games crowded lineup to prevent this from happening the story in and of itself is not necessarily bad however given the film s obviously low budget the weak screenplay the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film and most jarringly direction even more inept than that of paul w s anderson it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high only to have practically everything come crashing down the only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie as well as music by kmfdm megadeth rammstein juno reactor and others if ever you re looking to punish yourself for something then by all means watch this movie however if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself you will avoid this movie like the plague believe me you ll thank yourself later,negative
but the movie was pretty good i found myself highly disappointed in the book and almost wasn t able to finish it the characters were flat the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages and not a true story so i wasn t sure what to make of the movie i was pleasantly surprised though to enjoy the movie immensely it was long but it kept the pace going throughout the subtitling in the latin and french was a bit mundane to drudge through but it made the movie a bit more believable than everyone speaking english when the main character is actually french teabing was played brilliantly and while hanks was not who i would have thought for langdon he did a superb job in the role if you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense it is well worth watching murder mystery suspense action drama it s all there in this film,positive
this film does not come close to the quality of once upon a time in china first of all the plot is weak it does not have the kind of power that the original of this series did the characters in this film seem like they are out of a comic book while the characters in the first film were interesting and complex the kungfu is mostly unrealistic wirework and while once upon a time in china had some of this the emphasis was on realistic martial arts in the original the main characters were trying to resist the influence of the west which was destroying their culture but in this version the main characters are actually on the side of the westerners and they are fighting their own people there is no explanation of why wong fei hung and his crew would side with the people who were their enemies in the last film one of the reasons the original film was so good was because it was about brave chinese patriots trying to protect their culture but in this film is seems as though they have switched sides,negative
i read the book and saw the movie which other than title and major characters have little in common i can t say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when who wants to be a millionaire taught me about roman a clefs of which devil is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry i d have been more fascinated by the inside look that devil provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly editor in chief of runway magazine but somehow she s never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second \( or third \) made over princess role the minor characters including the wonderful tracie thoms as best friend lily are mostly wasted,negative
the documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots however it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different nato countries the actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered more the presentation both the picture and sound are top notch we found out that not every dvd system can read the imax presentation,positive
a style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women this movie is for you elliot s love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy contrived and lame narrative clealry it s about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting it s alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy if anything this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy sadly it s been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are camp and therefore funny indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp \( go read susan sontag boys \) and how low gay culture as plummeted there are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia and a secondary racist commentary about thai women entrapping aussie men trashy and not in a good way a must have for no brainer gay men,negative
i m sorry but this is honestly one of the worst movies i ve ever had the displeasure of witnessing i purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be in reality it s nearly everything that s wrong with low budget films first off the camera work is horrible secondly i ve seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays i mean these actors make keanu reeves look like denzel washington and finally the story was absolutely horribly done i admit the premise itself had some promise but the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor i might have had plain and simply this film was unwatchable i turned it off 65 through it and i would ve turned it off earlier but i was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen if you care at all about quality in any sense do not go near this piece of trash,negative
i echo most of the previous reviews this hayley mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent mary stewart novel that it shares some of its title with hayley was too young to be the novel s heroine and so for this film the plot and romance were youthened sanitized \( though the novel s romance was also chaste \) and also very much dumbed down as a featherweight hayley mills film this is harmless and very much a lesser disney film of the 60s just don t expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it even with your kids of today as a retro laugh,positive
it s not a great movie but it s a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it s quirky and has some decent \( for it s day \) effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it s cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want it s 80 s chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle,positive

i unfortunately wound up seeing this christmas misgiving on its original airing i have always been a fan of any christmas special since rudolph hit the air way back when each holiday season i hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the new rudolph this is so far away from that you would need the hubble space scope in order to see how close it came the imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise regrettably the story makes santa vs the martins look like an oscar contender such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3d gimmickry you can t improve on failure after it aired on tv i didn t see it return in later years on regular tv i didn t miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely can t win them all,negative
once again the powers that be at amazon have chosen to refuse to tell us if \( in this case \) the darin dee flicks if a man answers and that funny feeling are in widescreen or not pan and scan is garbage and we won t buy it \( that s why i only gave 1 star for now if they turn out to be widescreen i ll give them both 5 stars \) format color doesn t cut it color isn t a format anyway it s a specification or type widescreen is a format \( as is dvd and vhs to begin with \) so why the deep dark secret about certain movies amazon you list many others as being widescreen so why do you go on to neglect so many other hundreds though if it s a standard screen piece of junk go ahead and say so and be done with it and we ll boycott it but right now all you re doing by holding back this important information is slowing down sales,negative
i saw this thai horror film about 3 years ago i have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from thailand and i have seen a fair share of them \( nang nak the sisters mae nak art of the devil series \) the film focuses on tun and his girlfriend jane tun a photographer reunites with his old friends on the way home they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them ok i am not spoiling anything the story is more complex than it sounds tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them with jane caught in the middle as usual there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people shutter refers to his camera and what it represents sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones i m stopping here i don t want to give out anymore the plot is not that complex but believe me when i say the film is well made it does a great job of putting things together each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present i didn t see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric creepy feel to it also there is a scene in the movie that tun and jane looked at actual photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid honestly this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the shock ending has the greatest twist of any horror flick i ve seen i ve seen a lot of horror films only the exorcist and the omen ever scared creeped me out and shutter came very close my female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place since i haven t seen the tartan release and i only own the region 3 dts es rlease from panmedia \( hong kong \) but tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the hong kong or korean versions the video is sufficient with some dark and bright contrast it is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel the dts soundtrack is great though very crisp and loud the english subtitles are excellent the thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen a definite must see if you are a fan of asian horror or horror films in general it rivals ringu one missed call and the original ju on 1 and 2 four and 1 2 stars,positive

i find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and i also wonder as more and more older movies are being re released enhanced for widescreen tvs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen tv these movies scream out for the widescreen they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen tv and with one exception all the people who have written about them dont seem to care oklahoma carousel south pacific and king and i need to be updated to 16 9 anamorphic widescreen \( also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well \) fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future \( ie observe the two versions of an affair to remember \) of course this is a major rip off so anyone with a widescreen tv who has not bought these films hold off coz sooner or later they will get a proper release how long that is anybody s guess but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen dvd technology \( sound of music is fine and state fair was made in non widescreen full screen format an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen,negative
i should say up front that i have never played chess nor do i understand the game but i remember being intrigued about the film when i saw the theatrical trailer was i intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game was it the intense images of competition was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy the answer is all of the above searching for bobby fischer is an excellent family film for all i am living proof that even those who don t know jack about chess will love this movie it is a movie not just about chess but about acceptance the bond of love and friendship compassion for others and not being afraid to be who you want to be the balance of drama with edge of your seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film max pomeranc plays the young and sensitive josh waitzkin a pint sized seven year old with a cute lisp who becomes fascinated with the lower class men playing chess in a new york park he watches the men his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces he convinces his mother to go to the park with him where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman it is there that josh s mother realizes her son has a knack for chess also noticing josh is the fast talking park chess player vinnie \( a funny and great performance from laurence fishburne \) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game after a match with josh josh s father \( played by joe mantegna \) realizes his son s special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named bruce \( played by ben kingsley \) to make josh an even better chess master bruce sees a young bobby fischer in josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that bobby fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance through all the technical strategies of the game being learned josh and bruce develop a good friendship and with bruce s help combined with his own special gift josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies but there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess we ve all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child but what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents mind too much and what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you re not these are tests that run way deeper for josh waitzkin than any chess tournament josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game in his own way the insightful josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like bobby fischer did in the process josh pushes his father and teacher s feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings it s a matter of what is more important chess competition or love through it all the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear love and friendship for each other no matter what there are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain to the visit from his teacher at the chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show but amongst the competition and drama there are some nice comic scenes from vinnie s trash talking against the others in the park to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious to the humorous appearance by william h macy when he offers to get josh s dad a tuna sandwich the climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where josh takes bruce and vinnie s teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named jonathan jonathan is a boy i feel sorry for in the film playing since he was four years old all jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you especially when you cannot just be a kid the acting is terrific ben kingsley max pomeranc and joe mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film it s too bad that pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing a nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young bobby fischer talking about and playing chess with pomeranc narrating along it gives us a bit of the history of the world s greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when bobby fischer vanished enter josh waitzkin searching for bobby fischer is one of those stand up and cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well this is a movie you ll want to watch time and time again,positive
my six year old \( who has never been very excited about exercise \) really loves this dvd the routine is active fun and most importantly easy to learn other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered she completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning she asked to do it again my 2 1 2 year old has a great time dancing with us as well,positive

it is obvious that this movie is full of lies although i have not actually seen it i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel \( god bless them \) the way he attacks poor mr heston is deplorable can t michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he doesn t have his faculties about him i am also unsure that mr heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing making it appear that my president \( heston \) is an uncaring babbling idiot by simply using his own words shame on you michael and as for the way he got the gun from the bank i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn t give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank bravo to those who figured that out also michael moore is fat take that pinkie,negative
the last american virgin was literally one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and that s saying a lot it s not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom the writing was terrible the acting was terrible the direction was terrible the pacing was terrible the jokes were god awful etc even the girls weren t really that attractive \( with the huge 80s hair and bad fashion \) i mean what the hell was that fat ugly dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie and even more perplexing why was our hero trying to lay her and why was our hero best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with they would be at each other s throats in one scene and then best friends in the next i would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again i guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs they played whip it twice shake it up at least three times and at last count just once like five times when once was certainly enough songs that i didn t know at the beginning of the movie i knew by heart word for word by the end to top it all off this movie had one of the worst most disastrous endings i ve ever seen i can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt coming of age drama but when you re doing a mindless teen sex comedy you don t end on a downer and depress the audience after all the hell our hero goes through he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin and then without any follow up or warning the credits start rolling i was like what the hell the only great thing about the movie is that i had a ball paying mst3k only no one was around to appreciate my witty sardonic remarks so i ll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure on arguing with your best friend over the love of your life hey i stalked her first on sparking up a romance with said girl remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile didn t that mean anything to you on declaring your love for said girl i ve loved you ever since i destroyed your bike just so you d talk to me on major operations not that big a deal real line \( referring to the girl s upcoming abortion \) hey it happens all the time it s not that big a deal my line yeah it s a simple coat hanger procedure \( and later \) real line i know dozens of girls who ve done it my line i ve helped all the gals in the neighborhood they call me dr abortion on nerds at parties man there s nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw aww yeah on fat girls inconsistent characterizations of real line you know i have to be home by a quarter to 12 \( a minute later \) you said you had drugs where are they my line i have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me so fu k me in the a and let s do some blow before they come home on choose your mate carefully \( as our heroes scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous older woman \) nothing s funnier than getting gonorrhea eh folks skip this dreck and rent fast times at ridgemont high instead at least that one had phoebe cates,negative
i am an alice fan so this is far far from my favorite the first star i gave was simply because i love kate beckinsale and the movie isn t scary the other is because it would be enchanting for a 3 4 year old or another youngster that doesn t know anything about wonderland my 9 year old even got bored with this kate beackinsale plays the mother in the beginning and in 1999 she was much too young to be and definitely looked so she just didn t look well in this movie and everything looked so cheap and fake the story was changed in all the wrong places and too much was left out i would not recommend this i would recommend the 1999 american mini series of alice in wonderland it is my absolute favorite with martin short as the mad hatter and a long list of big names that one is fun for all ages,negative

scrubs has been a model of consistency in its five seasons and to interrupt myself why aren t we anticipating season five instead of season four and boo on them for being so slow to bring the show out on dvd and season four is no exception i recently rewatched seasons 1 through 3 on dvd with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present if you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it isn t as good as it used to be but i would be dishonest if i said that i detected any decline one thing i ve really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies this one really does have an overall story arc and i really appreciate bill lawrence and co taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way the story in season four revolves largely around the very very gradual repair of the friendship between jd and elliott fans of the show know that at the end of season three jd utterly smitten by elliott had expressed his love for her causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with jd no sooner had he done this however he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her season four opens with her filled with hatred of him complicated by the fact that she and he are named co chief residents \( though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads thanks to janitor chief resident and his misleadingly reads co chief resident causing many to imagine that she is over him \) some of my favorite visuals in the series are of jd and elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office barely large enough for the desk they face each other across of course eventually they patch things up but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement given the intensity of the events of the ends of season three any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with elliott murdering jd the season ends with carla and turk urging jd to move out and get a place of his own which leads to an interesting roommate situation in season five season four continued the scrubs tradition of having some very high profile guest stars this was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful colin farrell on one episode an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored \( there have been very few bad episodes of scrubs but this episode ranks near the bottom \) the always delightful heather graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season matthew perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father jonathan bennett perry a country singer best known to most people as the old spice sailor tara reid puts in another appearance as jd s terrible sometimes girlfriend while molly shannon is in another episode and julianna margulies of er appears in a couple of episodes the great tragedy with scrubs is that it remains something of a secret the only comedy better than scrubs in the past few years has been arrested development \( most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well and the lead of each show appeared on the other zach braff as the producer of the girls with low self esteem series of videos on ar and jason bateman as a patient on scrubs \) and while it won a large number of awards its ratings were worse than scrubs this show has decent ratings but shockingly few awards how terrible shows like everybody loves raymond and the formerly good but now dull will and grace beat it out for awards is mystifying and how did it manage only one emmy nomination it was nominated for best comedy series but why wasn t zach braff nominated for best comic actor and john c mcginley and donald faison for best supporting actor in a comedy series and sarah chalke for best supporting actress in a comedy series how is that possible much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory \( lauren graham yet again not nominated though clearly the best comic actress on tv for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her lost not nominated no nominations for veronica mars jason lee not nominated for my name is earl neither michael chiklis hugh laurie nor james gandolofini nominated for best actor while martin sheen who was barely appeared in this year s west wing while shows way way way way past their prime like will and grace and the west wing nominated and the list goes on \) but zach braff s failure to be nominated while charlie sheen and kevin james did is just one more reason not to take the emmys seriously at all at least the golden globes more or else get it right anyway awards aside and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the emmys \( how many emmy nods did buffy get despite most of the nation s best tv critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved \) fans of the show will be delighted with season four and if you aren t a fan you should be but don t start with season four go back and do it right either buy or rent \( i recommend buying you ll want to watch this more than once \) season one then work your way forward many pleasurable hours will result,positive

before i rate the box set and the four movies i would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films when i was really young i use to always ask my dad to rent tremors and we would all set and whatch it but when i got a bit older and i could understand things better i became afraid and was scared of grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me anyways after about two years i got the guts to whatch tremors 2 after shocks and afterwards i was agian afraid of grabiods and now shriekers attacking me finally after about ten years of not watching them me and my buddy travis got to talking about tremors and he asked me what grabiods where so i dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days i ended up creating a tremors comic so after becoming so involved with tremors again i decided to watch the first film again and after it ended i bought it off amazon and a week later i bought the third movie and then another week after that i bought the second i had literly gone a 180 from fearing tremors so long ago to become a huge fan and when the fourth finally came out i had my family my friend travis and his brother hooked now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over i can finally rate them the original tremors is by far the best with it s all star cast and great story line the second best would have to be tremors 4 the legend begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began tremors 2 after shocks would be third best since it stared earl and gummer and tremors 3 back to prefection would have to be the worst since it s story is weak its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far overall this is a great pack of all four tremors movies and if i hadn t boughten all of them aready i would buy this attack pack ps tremors 5 script has been finished and if tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth and one more thing it would be awsome if universal would release tremors the series on dvd,positive
this is a film like none other you have ever seen and as such you ll either love it or hate it from the reviews posted on amazon i ve come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don t have the intelligence to have understood a word of it this film is not literal learn to think about what you are watching to interpret archetypes symbolism and metaphor a clue the lady character is named story now why might that be and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world and what precisely does the wolf like scrunt represent and why are there three of those monkeys this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world if you aren t an artist you probably won t get it at all and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says and love every beautiful unique and visionary second of it magical,positive
the overwhelming impression i get from this film is wow these guys are alive they are not just making their way through a boring life they re out there doing interesting things doing cool stuff having adventures generally living their lives to the fullest the they that i refer to includes just about everybody in the movie from paul pena to the guys travelling with him to richard feynman to the tuvans that paul meets and befriends the documentary gets hazy in spots \( i m still not sure of some of the tuvan inter relationships \) but does a good job of establishing empathy with pena a blind man relying on others in a place far from home the dvd extras are o k the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie i did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but i suppose you could get more factual info technical details on the commentary,positive

that s all i could think of when my family and i sat down to watch this movie together we had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in santa fe the story itself is so powerful and moving built in the 1870s the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit the sisters prayed a novena to st joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived built the miraculous staircase and then disappeared without being paid the staircase is a double helix with no visible support it s 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near santa fee this movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards indians and also likes to curse \( how this has anything to do with the actual story i still have no idea \) at one point when a nun is shocked to hear mother curse mother surperior responds oh margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us when the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by god builds the staircase with wood that doesn t work is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better in the end the staircase is built and this mother superior \( who is on death s door \) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very weird uncomfortable scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies wow inspiring the best thing i could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a hollywood flop this was obviously written directed and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn t a miracle because hey miracles just don t happen the acting was pretty good but the story was junk unfortunately i bought this movie if you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family rent or buy mother theresa with olivia hussey hands down the best saints movie every filmed half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud wow she really cares about everybody inspirational movie compared to this disappointment,negative
it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film had he lived the crow sequels would have been much better the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace it set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990 s,positive

coming out at the same time as ken russell s rather more amusing valentino the world s greatest lover suffers from gene wilder s sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for the side splitting thus we get the odd huge close up of mouths covered in shaving foam and a lot of tiresome hysteria and tongues we also get far more of dom deluise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary though he s not as ott here as in sherlock holmes smarter brother for which we can at least be grateful unfortunately we get much more of wilder s tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical when in doubt shout seems to be his motto with wilder adding a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets nervous and he gets nervous a lot be still my aching ribs it s a reworking of fellini s near career killing early flop the white sheik even including a felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene only without fellini s restraint \( yes you did read that right \) with wilder s unemployed baker heading for hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing wilder does acknowledge the debt in a screen credit that s part thank you to my friend but seems more name dropping in a film that comes across as something of a vanity project certainly with wilder starring writing directing producing and even writing a song for the film it s fair to say where the buck stops on this one one of those films that at once offers fairly lavish period production design but often a complete lack of understanding of silent cinema yes we do get sped up comedy scenes it s definitely pre kevin brownlow s hollywood which completely destroyed most of the then common myths about silent cinema that this embraces indeed anachronisms abound with the feel \( and the songs \) often more thirties than twenties which perhaps wouldn t matter quite so much if it were all funnier it s not a total disaster there s the odd good line \( a conductor announcing hollywood home of the stars and several featured players \) a nicely natural performance from carol kane before she became a mess of mannerisms to rival wilder and it does offer a once in a lifetime chance to see james hong playing a norwegian \( or is it svedish \) studio executive complete with excellent accent \( also to be glimpsed among the bit parts in the supporting cast are danny de vito as an assistant director billy sands paparelli in sergeant bilko as a studio guard and as the boss of a bakery david huddleston here billed as michael huddleston s father \) fox s dvd offers a decent 1 85 1 widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version with optional original mono or remastered stereo mixes aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other wilder films \( young frankenstein sherlock holnes smarter brother and silver streak \) the only extra is an audio commentary by wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you ll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu,negative
we all feel alone at times this is something lost in translation brilliantly shows its audience indeed loneliness often paradoxically occurs in highly populated areas it is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel the more our differences stand out bill murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy who dosen t seem to quite know why he is where he is and why he is treated the way he is in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality this is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola it captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top this also sort of represents the zenith of bill murray s career and perhaps his best performance to date,positive

the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980 s it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series it was a travesty to see optimus prime \( the greatest of the transformers \) fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor \( rodimus prime \) who proved incapable of leadership galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie they were forgettable it amuses me that fans are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did as a fan i was insulted perhaps these other fans have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage,negative
from the first time our leading characters eyes meet you can feel the temperature rise in the room not your average sappy love conquers all type of love story this film shows the courage it takes to help love conquer,positive
when the lead character acts like she s sleepwalking through the entire film that s distracting when just about anyone from my high school s drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth then it s time to open up the wallet and hire better talent once you get past the special affects all which use cheesy models this godforsaken movie is boring as sin or should i say mud beside being preposterous for example the meteroid or whatever only hits a dam in its first strike this pitiful film is also delusional remember the scene where the head of fema risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire as hurricane katrinia proves there is no such thing as a bureaucratic administrator hero instead this movie comes off as a piece of not so subtle federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time,negative
would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the stewart granger version of king solomons mines he is alan quartermain personified and deborah kerr is a more than credible female lead all else is dross and while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic prisoner of zenda stewart granger like many of his contemporaries is under represented in the dvd revolution,negative
this movie is great i just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it i throughly enjoyed it entirely i believe it kind of relates to fatal attraction,positive
big trouble has a lot of big things going for it big laughs big plot big cast and because of all this it loses a peg or two for there s just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself you get somewhat lost in the jumble the film stars tim allen in the central role if you could call it that as a journalist who gets himself and his son \( foster \) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals \( sizemore knocksville \) a hitman \( farina \) a wealthy jerk off of a man \( tucci \) the mans wife \( russo \) her daughter \( zooey \) a homeless man that resembles jesus \( lee in a histerical role \) some mobsters dimwitt cops \( garofalo warburton \) fbi agents with attitude \( heavy d epps \) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva see all that and i haven t even got to the plot but it s one of those things you d have to see to really understand lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly does that sum it up it s funny real funny but it s also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace keeping you watching closly to understand all that s going on it ll mae sense in the end though i promise,positive

what a great idea to make a documentary of violinist hilary hahn traveling around the world and concertizing undoubtedly at the top of her profession hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone enviable precision and brilliant musicality this dvd portrait includes personal footage of hahn backstage at the philharmonie in berlin as well as a tour at the curtis institute a recording session at abbey road studios and a trip to hong kong in an age of music commercialism hahn is refreshingly real and self deprecating included on this dvd are excerpts from the korngold concerto mozart sonata for piano and violin in g major the lark ascending by vaughan williams chaconne from partita in d minor by bach and the paganini concerto no 1 on the menu there is additional concerto footage which includes the korngold concerto and mozart sonata in their entirety thank goodness because there s nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts if for nothing else buy the dvd for these complete live recordings because they are absolutely sublime the outer movements of the korngold sound a lot like film music which the classical music lover may or may not like but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended the mozart sonata is also very well played but this is nothing new as hahn has already released a recording of this this dvd is important because it contains video footage of hahn performing the only other dvd where you can find her playing is the last night of the proms in which she plays the mozart concerto no 4 in d major and presto from sonata no 1 by bach but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn t do justice to hahn,positive
this movie was just plain bad it doesn t just stink it reeks if i was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment i can t believe that the other reviews were so complimentary it s the reason why i purchased the movie and i regret my decision i should have read the reviews more closely some of the reviewers hadn t acutally seen the film while i am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film everything about this movie is sup par the script was horrible the sets amateurish the dialogue stilted \( and not in the funny style reminiscent of the tv series which i loved \) there are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink first the only footage they used was from the batman movie not the tv series i have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the tv series realized that this movie was so bad they didn t want to associate themselves with it they didn t use the original batmobile but a cheap rip off i could continue by why make you suffer the chemistry between adam west and burt ward is non existent and the chemistry between the actors playing adam west and burt ward in the flashback scenes is substandard at best this movie is beyond dreadful there are cameos from a few villains from the original tv show but they re dreadful too not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad i wish i could say i laughed i wish i could say that i at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all i can say is that i watched this movie in dead silence do not waste your money or your time on this movi,negative
i m not a fan of stephen king film adaptations the only one i like is carrie bec it was directed by brian depalma and featured terrific performances by sissy spacek and piper laurie cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful i couldn t wait for it to end not worth purchasing okay as a rental,negative
this is a great movie that everyone should see i m a conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie we don t see this movies as a republicans are bad movie thats dumb this movie is just what a movie should be funny and entertaining we all love the songs because they are not only great but true too,positive
this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals so if you re in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view five on the black hand side and breathe in the culture,positive

actually i felt i was in love with this film as soon as i saw the very beginning the opening credits against the background of chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music candyman could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense but bernard rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant enchanting and spellbinding film out of it if you re interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won t find it here \( you will but not in quantities you used to \) candyman is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what s important where mood is what matters where you are given some food for thought i don t have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film i can only say it s a great achievement of bernard rose as a director besides i guess tony todd virginia madsen and xander berkeley had their best roles played in this feature i don t personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre but candyman is a true gem which wouldn t be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times by the way if you don t want to spoil your impression of the film better don t watch candyman parts 2 and 3 they are the average tenage urban legend flicks,positive
much of the plot has been outlined above as well as the cast and i am in large part in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded i want to add that for anyone raised on the old universal horror pictures or the films directed by james whale or val lewton where the suspense is the important part of the film this picture shadows and fog has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame despite the comedic elements \( and there are many funny things happening \) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative the climax is dissapointing for many but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways i have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse oblique writings of hegel kant and the like i beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see bananas or sleeper love him or hate him you have to admit woody allen is deep a personal favorite film of mine but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea,positive
if this movie was ever going to have a chance it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just can t be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just wasn t time enough i guess to develop the characters or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating and we are left with painful stereotypes and in the case of roland michell a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you ve read the book skip the movie but if you saw the movie you should do yourself a favor and get the book,negative
the movie is a about a guy who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that that s pretty much the whole story well the idea is quite powerful but not new the characters are done in the comics style and very primitive the jokes are quite boring actually what is really amazing that it could ve been ok to watch as a family movie but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids too boring for adults not appropriate for kids too much moral for young crowd i can t really think who might like it,negative
dirty deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself this is idiotic but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll it s silly it s a teenager movie it s been done a million times before in hollywood \( most of the time poorly \) dirty deeds is one of the sub par high schoolers making mischief attempts where if you re perusing cable late one night and can t find anything else on your 500 channels is maybe worth a stop if you re determined to watch tv instead of just going to bed but who knows you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers just look what 1980 s teeneager movie hollywood knights launched for the likes of michelle pfeiffer tony danza robert wuhl and fran drescher everybody s got to start somewhere right,negative
i ll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 dvds ago and it continues with this volume as for the episodes themselves they were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs everything comes to a head and resolves looking back on the four episodes the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in japan this was not enough for a point deduction at the end of the day anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons you will not be disappointed,positive
i enjoy this genre of film but found this one dull it carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief but fall short of both aims i actually groaned in response to the predictability and shuttered at the stereotypes which were mentioned in another review at best stereotypes of ignorant aggressively dangerous and perpetually struggling african and hispanic american students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable blue eyed blonde haired european american belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive at worst these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring this movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both further it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial societal and economic issues which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for,negative
i have been waiting to see this film for a while now and i just finally saw it i m very dissapointed this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills the film sucks the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat and get stranded on a deserted isolated island was a great idea except that with this film you re going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi s make up looks silly they re not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh the picture quality has aged even if it s dvd format very grainy poor picture quality i have seen other movies from the 1970 s on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it s age but this was awful the only good thing it has was decent acting lol like i said before this is nothing but a \( low budget cheap horror film \) rent it if you like but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time,negative
i just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience i must say i think i have figured it out in some other reviews i think batricia birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers i think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground it is somewhat of a good story i can see why it would be reversed \( a guy trying to get the girl instead of the other way around \) you see eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one also frenchie is not with the pink ladies at all you see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school i think the chemistry between stephanie and michael were worked well together the songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie so really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether i know i know it is not the first one but sequels are usually not but they usually have connections to the first grease 2 tried to accomplish with frenchie and the tbirds pink ladies and all i am glad they were able to have eve arden sid ceaser plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like tab hunter is this movie cheesy yes is it done in less than expected direction yes does it have good songs yes \( cool rider reproduction we ll always be together girl for all seasons turn back and back to school \) the song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one after all kiddies patricia birch did do the choreography for both so in closing this movie made it to my dvd collection if for that reason alone if grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek if it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that i think if you loved the first grease then i think you should at least give this one a try,positive
i have worked out to denise austin for several years because i think she gives a good workout but i cannot stand her way too perky personality i was very disappointed in this dance workout the setting is fun and colorful and the music is great but as far as a workout this dvd really stinks i found some of the steps somewhat confusing \( but i am not very coordinated \) this workout was more of an indoor walk style workout \( like walk away the pounds w leslie sansone etc \) if you are looking for a fun way to get up and move this may be for you but this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout,negative
the synopsis sam and jonah baldwin father and son have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of chicago they move to seattle eighteen months later jonah can sense that his dad is still sad and in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self help guru on christmas eve to wish for his father a new wife annie reed lives in baltimore and is engaged to walter their relationship while loving and comfortable is entirely devoid of romantic sparks when annie hears jonah s soulful plea on the radio it s as if her heart has been touched by magic and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to sam and his son even if it means traveling across like 26 states the critique sleepless in seattle is a brilliantly simple film that s what makes it so great to quote nora ephron it isn t a movie about love it s a movie about love in the movies to emphasize this point she incorporates various parallel references to an affair to remember throughout the film but sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love \( which let s admit it have been undeniably shaped by what we ve seen on the silver screen \) the script is refreshingly candid yet endearing and nora ephron s direction is impeccable ross malinger cast as jonah baldwin is the youngest and most notable talent in the film he does an excellent job of portraying the quintessential eight year old he s impulsive moody and thinks he knows it all \( i speak from experience here folks i currently have a son that age \) he and tom hanks come together flawlessly as father and son so successfully in fact that they would be utterly convincing off screen the chemistry between meg ryan and tom hanks is equally amazing which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene the supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes rosie o donnell bill pullman rita wilson rob reiner david hyde pierce and a young gaby hoffmann families with younger children will appreciate the film s integrity there is very little foul language \( god damn it and it scared the shit out of me being the worst of it \) and no sexual content to be wary of all around this is a winning film one that i find myself watching over and over and over again the dvd for a 10th anniversary edition the special features are few and rather disappointing you ve got your basic director commentary a music video \( when i fall in love by celine dion clive griffin \) and a love in the movies featurette this last piece is approximately 15 minutes long it features the director producers actors and the hosts of loveline drew pinsky and adam carolla \( why they are included i don t know \) talking about love in the movies there are some interesting interview segments with an empire state building historian and some very beautiful shots of the new york skyline before 9 11 but there s certainly nothing here to write home about by far the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio \( and honestly how exciting is that \) this a dvd that you buy for the film alone,positive
this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie and slapping yahushua jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand the so called scholarly comments for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate even the lowliest of bible scholars if honest will realize this it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible while trying to tear it down at the same time the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rd dvd i gave the movie to a relative without that add on,negative
victor hugo s enormous output is unique in french literature he was described as the most powerful mind of the romantic movement and his novel published in 1862 continued to be widely read the plot that of a detective is as well the epic of the people of paris its author claimed it as a religious work and indeed by means of its characters sometimes a little larger than life yet always vital and engaging and by its re creation of the swarming parisian underworld the main theme of man s ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life hugo relives his youth in this vast novel the culmination of 14 years work he and valjean share their most outstanding characteristic their charitable heart the story contains glimpses of hugo s disgust towards the treatment of the lower class french citizens by the government valjean an ex convict recently released from prison but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child and towards the general injustice of the law enforcement system valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class the symbol of france s greed that hugo despises is thenardier the man that fantine entrusts cosette to who betrays the trust by essentially making cosette his personal slave the strongest emotions of les mis rables are love and hate javert and valjean are both extremes with a conscience incredibly strict liam neeson is cast as the gentle valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation he changes his ways to become years later the much loved mayor of vigau and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent giving manual and financial help to the weak sick and poor after nine years valjean was horrified to discover that javert a former guard of the quarries of toulon where he served almost 20 years has arrived to be the head of vigau s police force valjean s desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire \( indirectly \) one of his workers fantine turned prostitute he assumes responsibility for raising her daughter cosette he becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness geoffrey rush plays the icy chief inspector javert the man who tries to live his life without breaking a single rule when he is given the job of spying in the barricades and valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him things begin to fall apart for him the action of mercy of jean valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence he is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions he sees too late the truth valjean s legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud he is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in paris to investigate the mayor the man he believes is a convict when he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying monsieur le maire as the convict jean valjean he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed you must punish me he says or my life will have been meaningless \( a key line in the film \) uma thurman approaches the self indulgent character of fantine with admirable restraint giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film she gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character s frustration and pain exquisitely fantine s misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child being in a wild state enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery she is arrested after being humiliated by several would be customers but valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding javert s authority when valjean helps her she begins to rediscover hope her joy at the thought of having cosette with her is great but the shock of valjean s arrest and the discover that cosette is not there are too much for the poor creature claire danes plays the teenage cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful she disobeys her father s rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing marius a charismatic young parisian revolutionary with whom she fell in love cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the thenardier s inn horribly mistreated and constantly terrified she grew up in a convent innocent pure and a bit na ve peter vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered valjean around bille august tries to capture the essence of hugo s morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance keeping the eternal three elements the bishop handing over the candlesticks fantine s collapse marius crying out to the barricades history doesn t change as voltaire once remarked but what we need from it does valjean s story is not unique it s universal in other world it s contemporary there are certainly enough les mis rables to go all around the world,positive
from 1997 to 2003 joss whedon gave his audience some of the best episodes aired on television buffy the vampire slayer showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the unintimidating name of buffy

world even more as most of the watcher council are annihilated and giles is forced to seek out potential slayers \( who are also being killed off one by one by bringers no eyed murdering servants of caleb and the first \) and bring them to sunnydale for protection now more than ever buffy s leadership skills and methods are tested and even questioned as several of the potentials prove to be uncowed and contentious free thinkers buffy has never been forced to deliver as many bracing rallying speeches as she has been this season which attests to her foe s overwhelming level of menace because the first cannot enter our world in a corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people this is an opportunity for a callback of buffy s past uber foes for one last time we get to enjoy cameos of the master drusilla the mayor adam glory and two of the nerd trio pretty neat besides the first buffy faces two despicable and truly hard to kill villains who are themselves minions of the first the turok han an early caveman type of vampire \( thus even more sturdy than contemporary vampires \) and caleb the frightening mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats buffy senseless in several encounters as ever the writers do an amazing job the episodes are obviously action packed but underneath the surface the show is laden with metaphors and symbolisms themes of isolation the isolation of a leader female empowerment sacrifice friendship and humanity are touched on in great depth this season is also about the quest for redemption most of the members of buffy s

easy this season has to be the one with the most recurring characters in it principal wood and the potentials are introduced season 7 also marks the return of andrew faith and in one episode angel

really focuses on anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold only spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the series the camera of course is ever on buffy summers the

once again koch for reasons that i cannot possibly fathom assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren t being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes i know i m feeling large amounts of gratitude it s gratitude when you want to disembowel someone right at least the copy i bought was used so koch didn t make a dime off of me anyway this is another koch release that you should definitely avoid,negative
gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie \( of course it was just a product of its time the mid 60s it s not a film trying to recapture the era it is the era \) still the storyline is slim and the going slow interesting scenes appear here and there the parts are definitely better than the whole there s an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should actually thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was it s subtle i ll grant you that and a nice character study and yet we were counting the minutes left in the film by the end \( only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives \) so that s not a good sign,negative
i love this show it is well written superbly cast and always fun to watch i highly recommend,positive
first of all this is not the worst movie ever made nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars the worst movie ever made was autumn in new york but that is a different review no this not a great movie but it is very interesting and for once thank god it doesn t end with everything tied up in a pretty hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone it has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie and the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie bleak more interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing for molly ringwald she didn t do anything of note again until the stand six years later and for andrew mccarthy well it could be argued that he still hasn t starred in anything of note again \( although he probably made some money from weekend at bernies i ii \) anyway probably better to rent than buy i am only buying it to complete my 80 s collection,negative

if you liked raise the red lantern or the last emperor this is a perfect movie gong li who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband s affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband farewell my concubine uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera which is an acquired taste this movie uses the story of a king his beloved concubine s self sacrifice to frame the love story between two men when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman the stage is set for a tragic love triangle the final scenes are chilling powerful this is a spectacle not to be missed,positive
despite the chintzy unconvincing facial hair \( jeff daniels being the exception \) martin sheen s too gentlemanly interpretation of gen lee s accent \( and his beard \) obvious saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war generalized \( and largely inaccurate \) interpretations of the underlying history of the war and hopelessly ridiculously wildly off the mark attempts atnew england accents the film still works i understand that to get a film produced and distributed it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice and c thomas howell s performance well let s just say that his glued on beard was more convincing than his acting jeff daniels however does an excellent job in large part because he doesn t try to convince you he s from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers using every stereotype associated with nasal r dropping instead of focusing on the so called nasality of the ne accent \( think of sheen in the missiles of octobah \) daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief but then here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner aren t the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production i think the story works because there s enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle but the movie makers either didn t have the budget for gore \( maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards \) or decided to err on the side of forbearance if gettysburg had been made 8 10 years later it might have benefited from the newer style of violence depiction as in saving private ryan thin red line or gladiator it falls a bit short of that however finally it should be noted that the producers director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war s historical underpinnings opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery they fought to preserve the union which is a very different concept abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south s hand but it was not the sole cause of the war the movie dumbs this down a bit making the message more like what you d find in a 5th grade text book the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war the north absolutely needed to win it but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost 2 years after gettysburg c thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie still and all the film is very watchable and due credit should be given to the re enactors arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film,positive

the star trek collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series dvd collections \( the original series the next generation deep space nine voyager and enterprise \) at around 1100 minutes per box \( a few hours less than the tos seasons \) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing that is 1 month of non stop star trek no dvd series comes remotely close to that get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years by the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe this is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years it is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also our very planet earth has advanced because of gene roddenberry s admirable concept roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too the bridge members are like our family watch what they do then go and spend your life striving for the same on earth what engineer medic scientist teacher worker can not say that star trek has not influenced them the show is this significant in the development of our species even christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why the dvd case is not quite as fancy as the tos \( the original series \) cases the tng case is supposed to resemble a tng crew briefcase the case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs there are 4 episodes per disc however the last disc disc 7 only has two episodes for a grand total of 26 episodes \( tos has 8 discs 30 episodes \) the rest of disc 7 is devoted to star trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras and then some more the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed but in the sequence that they aired however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in this means on one disc you have shows 4 2 12 and 1 in that order the sound has also been remastered to 5 1 dolby digital since the show was shot in full frame these dimensions are retained star trek the next generation \( tng \) season one had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast an instant hit and a milestone in television serials \( it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3 \) its characters and new look enterprise had us glued to the tv with the first computer generated images of our solar system as captain picard utters the immortal words to baldly i mean to boldly go where no man i mean to boldly go where no one has gone before viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the tos series but is more of the same again \( even remaking some tos episodes \) this time with more characters more action and more special effects season 1 all of the main characters in the tng series are in episode one captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant lt commander geordi la forge lieutenant tasha yar lieutenant worf commander dr beverly crusher lt commander commander deanna troi lt commander data and ensign wesley crusher only natasha yar quits before the first season is finished commander dr beverly crusher is replaced by doctor katherine pulaski for season two ensign wesley crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after season four the enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing playing an important function in many episodes the use of computer generated images \( a ground breaking television experience back in 1987 \) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences planets backdrops an improved bridge main viewer and windows advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android tng season one attempts to relate with tos by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made tos so interesting the stories \( also written by tos s dc fontana \) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s early 90s when tng first aired season one of tng is mostly about deities infections alien cultures galactic politics time travel alien forces mind control family matters computer malfunctions and starfleet academy there are also the unforgettable episodes encounter at farpoint which introduces us to the crew of the enterprise and the mysterious q where no one has gone before a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos datalore which features two data characters heart of glory with some in depth revelations about klingons skin of evil featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending and the classic conspiracy \( this episode is uncut which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings so parents be cautious \) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of starfleet the bottom line for tng season one is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out although we can debate about which is the better series tng or tos we still absolutely adore both we might miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume but hearing picard saying make it so just makes our day season 2 season two still carries on with repeating much of the stories in tos revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own boosting data s screen time bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres improved alien cgi and an enhancement in particle effects they even attempt a type of morphing most of the main characters from season one are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker \( now with a beard \) lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf \( letting his hair grow \) commander deanna troi \( complete with low cut red starfleet costume \) lt commander data and ensign wesley crusher however obviously commander lieutenant tasha yar is gone but so is dr beverly crusher \( who was not bad looking \) replaced by doctor katherine pulaski \( who looks like your granny \) for season two because dr crusher has been reassigned to starfleet medical as explained in episode one of season three \( in reality the tng writers where having difficulties in developing crusher s character would later reinstate her for season three dropping pulaski because they felt her character was not working \) colm meaney as miles edward o brien navigation from season one gets more screentime while the new whoopi goldberg chatacter guinan is the wise el aurian bartender in 10 forward the new bar room where the enterprise crew get to relax except for this extra area the enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more enterprise based than season one or all of tos meaning season two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback but sets a new standards in the hotel in space feel that would produce the deep space nine series season two of tng is mostly about alien impregnation mystery space ai the holodeck interplanetary relations rapid aging justice shape shifting time travel family the prime directive kidnapping cloning war games and infections the big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with klingons and the first encounter with the borg the unforgettable episodes are elementary dear data where data takes on his sherlock holmes persona and we are introduced to the moriarty character loud as a whisper is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator a matter of honor is where riker serves on a klingon battleship q who may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the borg the last episode of season two shades of gray may be one of the worst star trek episodes ever which uses riker s memories from seasons one and two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the season one episode conspiracy featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings so parents be cautious again \) the bottom line for tng season two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down we get the borg and lots and lots of klingons at this stage in the saga we might still miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume but how will picard defeat those assimilating half man half machine entities that are heading his way he better make it so with season three season 3 it was the dawn of the 90s and since cgi had undergone some development the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence but with better looking planets \( complete with moving gaseous atmospheres \) and major enhancements in particle effects towards the end it undergoes new model development lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look the crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker \( now with a bigger belly \) lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf \( letting his hair grow even more \) commander deanna troi \( with more makeup costume changes and even an aerobics outfit that really isn t as good as it sounds \) lieutenant commander data and ensign wesley crusher \( new hairdo \) dr beverly crusher is back \( initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better \) and doctor katherine pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again pulaski s disappearance is not officially explained \( in reality diana muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in l a law instead mcfadden was asked to rejoin the series again \) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with dr crusher making reference to pulaski s work in episode four commander lieutenant tasha yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode dwight schultz \( murdoch from the a team \) makes his first appearance as lieutenant reg barkley who would have a reoccurring role colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien navigation doesn t have much of a role boost since season two while the whoopi goldberg s guinan character of the wise el aurian the bartender in 10 forward has her background further developed season three of tng is mostly about nanotechnology colonization super aliens the prime directive orphans ancient space booby traps romulans wormholes peace negotiations defectors super humans terrorism q court inquisitions parallel universes ai klingon high councils captivity experiments time travellers biological space crafts morale the first law of robotics vulcans sarek evolutionary speciation and the borg unlike season two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season evolution where nanotechnology takes over the enterprise the survivors is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet who watches the watchers is about the prime directive failing when the enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped offspring sees data creating another sentient android sins of the father has worf return to his klingon homeworld to defend his family honour hollow pursuits has lt barkley fantasizing about crew members in the holodeck sarek is about the vulcan of the same name from star trek the original series who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation and of course the pot boiler end episode of the best of both worlds part i \( widely acclaimed as one of the best star trek episodes ever \) marks the grand entrance of locutus of borg onto the scene the bottom line for tng season three is that it is often cited by fans as the best tng season and is probably the first of the seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets in season three everyone seems to have matured included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie especially towards the end there is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since j r ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff hanger episode that the best of both worlds part i would deliver on meaning every trekie \( and who wasn t at this time \) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved there is no time to loose onto season four wooosshhhh season 4 not since j r ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff hanger episode that the best of both worlds part i would deliver on at the end of season iii meaning every trekie \( and who wasn t at this time \) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved there was no time to lose onto season four wooosshhhh so here we are with season three it was the dawn of the 90s and cgi had undergone some development and improvements \( better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres particle effects lighting and subspace effects \) with season three things started to have more of a movie budget look season four tries to maintain that class most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf \( who keeps growing that hair \) commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data dr beverly crusher and ensign wesley crusher \( now a starfleet officer with full uniform also departs from tng half way through this season and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons \) colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien and whoopi goldberg s guinan lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for season four such as worf s lover k ehleyr the traveller k mpec the klingon leader duras whose dishonesty caused worf s discommendation and the romulan tomalak there is also a surprise character at the end of this season season four of tng is mostly about the borg family dr soong and the ai emotion chip adoption the space time continuum hostage rescue the klingon high council romulans alternative universes holographic projection survival loosing special abilities renegade captains the devil amnesia first contact love nightmares mutations super intelligence robin hood witch hunt trials euthanasia host life forms mind control and honour like season three most the episodes in season four have great stories combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did it is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established apart from containing part ii of the best of both worlds the introduction of the cardassians who would become major players in the star trek deep space nine franchise makes it even more valuable there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season the best of both worlds part ii concludes the cliff hanger from season three with some great battle special effects family has picard going home to see his brother and family brothers features dr soong who is data s creator reunion returns to the story of worf and his klingon dishonour the wounded features the cardassians for the first time clues has data disobeying picard first contact sees riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring the the nth degree has barclay taking control of the enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence qpid for its historical recreation of robin hood and of course redemption part i which deals with worf s dishonour the bottom line for tng season four is that it keeps up the pace of season three and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want although not quite the cliff hanger end episode that the best of both worlds part i was redemption part i still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know we are left asking ourselves if the hard man is really gone and why does she look like a romulian as picard would say i can live with a mystery but we just can t onto season five as quick as we can season 5 season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects the display panels on the enterprise are more interactive the camera can now pan as special effects take place deep space battles seem more intense we also get a new star trek title graphic in the opening sequence the cliff hanger conclusion of redemption part ii is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between klingons romulans and the federation turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get none the less it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of tasha yar most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard \( with a new red suede coat and grey uniform \) commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge \( who sports a new beard in one episode \) lieutenant commander worf \( who left the enterprise in season four \) commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data and dr beverly crusher ensign wesley crusher \( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons \) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren a bajoran colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien as is whoopi goldberg s guinan alexander rozhenko as worf s son now has a reoccurring role since season four keiko o brien \( miles o brien s wife \) is firmly established as a reoccurring character watch out for the special appearances of ashley judd as ensign robin lefler and leonard nimoy as spock whoot whoot strangely enough this is the only season where q of the omnipotent q continuum does not make an appearance lieutenant reginald barclay engineer is also absent from this season season four of tng is mostly about the klingon high council romulans communication bajora crystalline entities disasters addiction reunification time travel parenting telekinesis eugenics amnesia possession euthanasia sexual repression time warps children cover ups sexual attraction imaginary friends borg invisibility alternative lives and phase shifting like season four most the episodes in season five have great stories a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew it much more of the same as in season four with the better episodes being redemption part ii darmok an interesting episode about language the introduction of the bajora and ensign ro the silicon avatar makes a return unification part i and ii \( both here \) with spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole tng franchise certainly more popular than time s arrow part i which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to data on earth the masterpiece society shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world huge of borg also makes his first appearance in i borg apart from the unification double episode the instalments ethics about worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and the game when entertainment becomes mind control have both achieved cult status as some of the best tng episodes ever aired season five unfortunately has some dull episodes too many of which occur in the second half of the season so the best stuff is within the first four discs it doesn t really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with season six but no doubt because six is as good as five was then we are there for it as a note redemption part ii this episode received as 12 age rating in the uk because it contains klingon ritual head butting violations also has sexually violent content \( psychic rape \) parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children if you are going to move onto season six then you will probably want to know that during season six the crew make contact with deep space nine so if you get deep space nice season one you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order if you are in for six you may also be in for season one of ds9 season 6 season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that star trek deep space nine season 1 whipped up while season 6 was running 1993 was tv sci fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of st for the year this means for the folks who have been watching tos and tng now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between tng season 6 and ds9 season 1 you can find the order if you search the new for it tng has really good stories while ds9 gets the effects we are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises \( picard acting like a russian is hysterical would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time maybe yes \) the conclusion of time s arrow is not the best cliff hanger but sufficient most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data and dr beverly crusher ensign wesley crusher \( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons \) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren a bajoran colm meaney is here again as miles edward o brien but will be transferred to ds9 \( his absence is not mentioned \) whoopi goldberg s guinan is back along with alexander rozhenko keiko o brien \( miles o brien s wife \) will also leave for ds9 lieutenant reginald barclay engineer is back after being absent from season 5 season 6 of tng is mostly about transporter psychosis empaths scotty alien abductions q age regression android dreams artificial life cardassians prof moriarty love romulan defection destiny klingon birthrights thieves command ethics origins of life insanity murder faith doubles time travel and the borg like season 5 most the episodes in season 6 have above average sci fi stories combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew memorable episodes include a fistful of datas the quality of life ship in a bottle face of the enemy birthright and lessons there are three very good episodes which really make the season worth tapestry sees picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart suspicion is a great whodunit episode \( of which there are a few \) with one of the coolest star trek aliens ever \( should have made him a main character \) descent part i is a very nice slight of hand trick you will keep thinking hugh right up until the last second season 7 star trek season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion making way for some star trek films but in reality it is deep space nine season 2 \( ds9 season 1 starts in star date chronological order with tng season 6 \) that is the new trek fans of star trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional sf tv era the conclusion of descent part ii has the finale of lore most of the main characters from season two are here captain jean luc picard commander william t riker lieutenant commander geordi la forge lieutenant commander worf commander deanna troi lieutenant commander data and dr beverly crusher ensign wesley crusher \( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons \) returns for one episode while ensign ro laren a bajoran was supposed to replace him she only appears in one episode in season 7 although the episode is a major one focused on her colm meaney shows up again as miles edward o brien for the last episode whoopi goldberg s guinan is gone without explanation \( see the movie star trek nemesis on her \) alexander rozhenko is back keiko o brien \( miles o

troi and worf reverse evolution wesley and the traveller klingon right of ascension picard s son abiogenesis ro laren and time travel while there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one \( masks for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise \) most are well above average and some are incredible memorable episodes include gambit forces of nature inheritance lower decks thine own self journey s end and bloodlines the pegasus is probably the best episode of the season but the finale all good things is really where it is at with some good aging effects a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic enterprise to die for the series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek in short there is nothing like st tng it evolved tv serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years it set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars all we can say about this awe inspiring series can be summed up in one word amen,positive
like many of the reviewers here i am an anne rice fan however i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them i mean few of the dracula movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker s novel all i wanted and expected was a flashy no substance guilty pleasure movie a la dracula 2000 that alone should tell you my expectations but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure the storyline didn t make a lot of sense when taken on it s own and the acting was bad to bland i also take issue with the badly done look of the vampires rice s vampires are supposed to be beautiful whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house however one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat since the videos are included on the dvd it earns 1 star,negative
as has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as you ve got mail with tom hanks and meg trout pout ryan of the several versions in the good old summertime is my least favorite the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma which doesn t quite cut it here the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie there are no real sparks van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts pleasant but stale and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow judy in particular is disappointing she looks like she has no neck i don t know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it s head into it s shell all hunched up and everything i couldn t figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player and van wasn t great either i ve always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he doesn t do anything to dispel that image here if you re a fan of the stars or the early 1900 s then you might like this movie but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection,negative

is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects,negative
i m a huge don cheadle fan but this film is unworthy of him people who claim that it s a story about racism either don t understand the film or don t understand racism basically here s the plot the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store rather than summon help for the others all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register he is caught and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film because pfeiffer s family insists on proving that he s no animal and can take his punishment in this case death with his head held high yeah right guess what he is an animal and if the story had involved all black or all white characters racism wouldn t be an issue a more compelling question if pfeiffer s family was so concerned with his dignity why didn t they teach him moral values in the first place,negative
i think i understand what camp is the damned is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of nazi germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time i guess gay folks everywhere can blame luchino visconti the great director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in nazi ss garb mel brooks realized in his film the producers that nazi s are damn funny but not even brook s vision could foresee the downfall of the essenbeck family as the currents of early nazi bloodshed swirls about the uniforms are art deco at its worst the young blonde aryan cross dressers are a bathhouse dream until they re lined up against the wall rome may have had caligula but the reich had blonde pedophiles what a thrill to see helmut berger swishing about in marlene dietrich bodice and stockings i watched the whole thing and i m going to end this review to take a shower,negative
hi folks the movies all look very good and there are a nice group of bonus features from vintage featurettes to commentaries on macao i particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with jane russell and robert mitchum that robert osborne conducted very late in the life of mr mitchum the packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great robert mitchum at under 10 each on dvd w bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal the movies aren t generally considered mitchum s best or best known but when you consider you ve got jean simmons as a costar and otto preminger directing angel face josef von sternberg helming macao vincent minnelli directing home from the hill the great fred zinneman directing and the legend deborah kerr co starring in the sundowners you can figure this isn t the bottom of the barrel either oh and sydney pollack directed the yakuza and contributes a great commentary to sum up warner bros continues to deliver the very best classic titles on dvd with the best combination of quality transfers bonus features and value packages,positive

do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer on many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible on several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television don t make the mistake i made in hindsight i would only purchase this collection if i found it in a dollar bin sale which is most likely where these mill creek collections will be in a year or so,negative

i m told by fellow film enthusiasts that bu uel s later films do not show this spanish master at his best that his earliest films his famous collaborations with salvador dal for instance show an edgier more fascinating bu uel whatever i saw his 1974 film the phantom of liberty for the first time recently and i immediately fell in love with it there are those who swear by his more popular 1972 oscar winner the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie but somehow i think the phantom of liberty is even more entertaining than discreet charm there is no plot to speak of in phantom this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds bu uel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images monks pray for a woman s sick father and then play poker with the woman and smoke a group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets and go to the bathroom to eat in private two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter even though she s right there in class when they call her name in the universe bu uel concocts in the phantom of liberty anything goes the amazing thing about this movie is that instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches the phantom of liberty has a broad theme to support its free form structure it s bu uel s comic vision of freedom run amuck sure the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone but as bu uel seems to be suggesting even freedom has its limits the opening scene of the movie is set in toledo spain in 1808 as napoleon s troops attempt to liberate the spanish and are greeted with cries of down with liberty there can be times when we want the assurance of authority rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please bu uel doesn t take a stand one way or the other really he s just an artist who is intrigued by the idea and his interest fuels the free form structure of the film and its content almost anything and everything he can think of within the bounds i suppose of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career is thrown into this movie and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure i found its elegant chaos exhilarating only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this i think bu uel pulls it off triumphantly here somehow he makes the movie seem almost logical the way it progresses the phantom of liberty is a sheer delight highly recommended,positive

if you believe in the devil and i mean really believe in the devil i can t think of one good reason why you d want to summon the devil into this world at worst he s purported to be the father of lies and one of the fallen angels this means that anything he tells you is suspect anything he gives you is suspect and he probably has the power to make you believe in him yikes not a safe trip not a terribly sane trip for that matter yet that is precisely what boris balkan \( frank langella \) desired he had one copy of the nine gates of the kingdom of shadow and there were three extant one or all of these books is a forgery and one or all holds the secret to summoning satan he hires corso \( played a bit too understated by johnny depp \) to research the other texts the movie is based on the novel the club dumas by arturo perez reverte which i favorably reviewed i can t give a similar review to the ninth gate for a number of reasons first depp s portrayal of corso was one dimensional and corso was a multi dimensional character whether that s the filmmaker s fault or depp s i don t know but depp s corso was a dreadful bore a mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his demonstrating supernatural abilities we are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping corso or in what her abilities might have been \( never mind her identity \) yet since this is a character from the book i know why she was there i have a pretty good idea who she was \( and good job to the author on how he handled that \) and her character s interests and abilities could have been better communicated with very little difficulty also in a rather silly departure from the book \( departures are fine i m not being a book snob \) they substitute an average sized platinum blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall white and physically imposing there s nothing that irritates me more than a quota substitute i don t think this particular sub had any speaking lines which makes it that much more of an insult i love intelligent thrillers \( i didn t care for the da vinci code \) this was a thriller that spent time in libraries that examined woodcuttings drawn perhaps by lucifer himself yet i wasn t engaged in 1999 when the film was released i couldn t sit through it after reading the club dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two i approached the film again hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help it did not in fact it raised more questions i would give this movie 2 5 stars and round it up to 3 however i m reviewing the dvd and the dvd gets a big spanking for not having subtitles there s no excuse in this day and age for a mainstream dvd not to offer subtitles,negative
the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i ve seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it s almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film s ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote just okay nothing to write home about,negative

torz k \( abandoned \) is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by rp d sopsits that takes us back to hungary of 1960 when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone especially children the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure ron \( tam s m sz ros \) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father \( s ndor g sp r \) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters ron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother s blindness by his friend atilla \( szabolcs csizmadia \) and the two bond emotionally and physically in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya \( krisztina somogyi \) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff there is one teacher in the orphanage school nyitrai \( l szl g lffi \) who has been reduced to his position as an imprisoned one by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy nyitrai offers ron solace and introduces his fellow traveler to the glory of the stars giving ron a map of the heavens that ron cherishes his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison like orphanage he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government hangs himself this horrid incident drives ron to organize an escape from the orphanage an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which ron feels responsible and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by p ter szatm ri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period the musical score by p ter fejcsik tam s g rg nyi ferenc toma and bal zs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings in all this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking acted with depth in every role and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books highly recommended grady harp march 06,positive
i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it s really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me god made music and god made animals they re awesome,negative
take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same really is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids they deserve better the key point of this movie is that lying is bad good point a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks also good unfortunately the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible \( even kids will have a hard time believing a man can t tell he s been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror \) and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion the entire thing falls flat making films for children is a fine thing they shouldn t be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children however quite honestly i d rather have a kid watch something like good will hunting before this don t waste your children s time with this film read them a book a good book instead,negative

by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years it s true the patriots somehow pieced together a team that despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17 2 record \( which just as easily could have should have been 18 1 \) but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just doesn t seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003 part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities \( 2001 having 9 11 the coming of age of tom brady the snow bowl and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy the early stumbles to buffalo and washington the birth of the winning streak winter weather in foxboro and yet another thrilling super bowl finish \) 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the w on the patriots side of the field this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling the injuries \( leading to the incredible throwback two way play of veteran wide receiver rookie cornerback troy brown \) the continued winning streak the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts and the return to pittsburgh \( where the record 21 game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween \( just days after the red sox won the world series karmically enough \) where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville fl no nail biting endings this time though despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else \( with the possible exception of curt schilling of course \) the eagles all pro was clearly the second best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day \( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick actually \) and the patriots though trailing early never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24 21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved far be it that a season ending with a record of 17 2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum drum but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that impressive as it was just doesn t translate to the memorable re telling that the pats previous title years do this is a great dvd for pats fans indispensible even but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd s over this one,positive
argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by lumiere after hitchcock and ray leone and fuller argento is the last true auteur to make genre films visually a film like profondo rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed objects and people alike take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker cinema is not an answer but a question and argento is the answer to eisenstein s theory of film as violence violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them a murder a painting a mother a son a mirror all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing the mystery of cinema the questions are resolved,positive
this is the dumbest most predictable horrible waste of time i ve ever ever seen this movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn t it took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that s supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe drink and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us after watching this movie i felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash my only hope is that our european friends didn t seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident,negative
i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that s exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i didn t like was william hurt s performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would ve moved along at a better pace but still a great movie,positive

this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things while i agree the acting \( especially the girls playing christy and ariel \) is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us \( yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada \) anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country i know the dad is an actor but couldn t he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan the mom is a teacher but can t find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally yet there is money for private school fixing up the dump of an apartment an expensive camcorder betting the rent money on an et doll etc i can t imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the drug house with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child a son that has recently died i kept expecting someone to call social services and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched the symbolism between mateo the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed though the film is told through the oldest daughter s eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have gotten this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed,negative

disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full length feature film snow white and the seven dwarves ironically given this early success snow white was their only hit movie for the next 13 years world war ii kicked the hell out of disney s overseas markets even movies today regarded as classic disney pinnochio bambi fantasia lost money on initial release disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the us government and the south american films that were part of fdr s good neighbor policy etc stuff that made back its costs but not much more by 1948 disney was in dire financial straits they had just enough money for one more movie walt disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn t survive and it would have to be what they did best a full length animated feature film walt said to himself what we need is a movie about a girl in trouble audiences love that they loved snow white that s what he wanted a movie like snow white but even more so more comedy more drama more magic more music more lovable characters he chose as the basis of his company s hail mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world cinderella disney didn t have the money as they had on earlier films to lavishly storyboard every scene thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action then the animators used stills from that as storyboards the photos used survive to this day and many are provided as a special edition extra in some cases these photos have the animator s drawings over them turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in cinderella s family chateau in 1950 cinderella was released and was everything disney so desperately needed even today cinderella is arguably the best movie disney s ever made it s just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film the animation artwork was a product of disney s famous nine old men at that time not yet old cinderella pulls off superbly something not particularly easy to do it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work from eric larson and marc davis beautiful and graceful cinderella to ward kimball s wonderful jaq and gus gus the mice and over the top lucifer the cat everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural part of walt disney s plan to out snow white snow white with cinderella involved its music he very consciously wanted cinderella to be a source of hit songs there had been hit songs from disney films before \( heigh ho and whistle while you work from snow white when you wish upon a star from pinnochio etc \) but they d been almost accidental oh we have a hit song well that s nice for cinderella disney for the first time went to tin pan alley \( 28th street in new york city where the professional songwriters could be found \) disney wanted his girl s music done by the very best craftsmen the guys who wrote hit songs for a living the cinderella soundtrack hit big \( a 1 album with 3 4 million units sold \) with songs even today considered quintessential disney most notably a dream is a wish your heart makes from the movie s opening scene the work song while the animals help cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown and bibbidi bobbidi boo \( nominated for an academy award as best movie song of the year \) from the fairy godmother transformation scene for their best movie disney apparently spared no expense producing the dvd not only has the picture quality been digitally restored but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5 1 surround sound mix totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies \( cinderella has the distinction of being the noisiest movie ever restored according to its audio crew \) the original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists a word about the movie s aspect ratio \( i e how wide the picture is compared to its height \) the dvd cover says cinderella is presented in its original full screen aspect ratio \( 1 33 1 \) this is untrue virtually all sound films until 1953 including cinderella were 1 37 1 since a tv screen is 1 33 1 you don t lose a lot when the original is formatted to fit your television i just wish they hadn t lied about it cinderella ends at breakneck pace we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to happily ever after bing bang boom walt disney believed audiences like a happy ending but they don t like a happy ending that goes on too long hey who am i to argue well maybe i ll argue a dvd extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used one of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding cinderella is taken by the grand duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes the first time prince charming sees her since the ball she s not wearing a lovely gown she s wearing her scullery maid outfit cinderella is frightened how will he react when he realizes she s not a fine lady but a poor servant girl and of course he doesn t care how she s dressed he loves her anyway i can see that scene in my mind it would have worked beautifully this is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better,positive
this is a most beautiful movie i can t imagine anyone not enjoying it the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone,positive
but i m giving season four 4 stars because there aren t any subtitles in this set they also didn t have subtitles for season 3 but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 2 strange huh however the quality of the dvds are fine and the episodes of course are wonderful to watch at the end of this season the meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good but he decides to stay with the bunkers a little longer so he can get his masters degree there aren t any special features or anything in this dvd set but as long as the episodes are uncut i m happy if you re a fan of the show this dvd set is a must have,positive
tim burton offers the most charmingly off beat yet visually sumptuous movies in hollywood from his stop animation work \( the corpse bride \) to dark romances \( edward scissorhands \) to horror \( sleepy hollow \) burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably all the right notes are there but some are played just off key enough to create the thrill of tension perhaps no other director was so suited to film roald dahl s most famous work charlie and the chocolate factory and remain true to the author s vision most people associate the tamer goofy willie wonka and the chocolate factory starring gene wilder with dahl s tale but forget that dahl had a healthy streak of lemony snicket sensibility to him so it is perfect that burton makes a darker more dangerous film for all to enjoy the visuals in charlie are astounding the chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate \( not the icky brown water of willie wonka \) and the squirrel nut sorting room is a classic of mind blowing set design and that is not all oh no that is not all possibly the most visually stunning element in charlie is willie wonka himself played by burton favorite johnny depp depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them and one wonders what inspired depp s quirky nervous mean spirited selfish concoction depp plays wonka as tight as he plays jack sparrow loose and he never misses a note but whereas gene wilder s willie wonka was more genial puppetmaster depp s wonka has a sadistic streak in him perhaps instilled by his dentist father this is a great if much maligned performance the most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly drug inspired presence of the oompa loompas wonka s army of diminutive henchmen in the wilder film the oompa loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy oompa loompa do be de do tune in this version all the oompa loompas are played by the same character \( even though there are hundreds of them \) and their dance numbers are even more fantastic however the songs don t have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest indeed there are several lyrics that i just couldn t catch in this film version and that is a pretty major quibble far from a feel good movie but definitely a good movie charlie and the chocolate factory deserves to be seen and for fans of artistic visions studied,positive
this went up from one in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii but otherwise its just a mess the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes who also gave us such film masterpieces as casino royale and chitty chitty bang bang richard harris is his usually unrestrained self and thats not a compliment now i wont even go into the politics which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas s paean to charles ii in twenty years after but nowhere near as entertaining,negative
no no no dvd technology is for quality image and movie collectors this time artisan did not pay respect i think it s the worst dvd in my collection bad transfer full frame and etc,negative
about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who s not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick incestuous and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood don t watch this,negative
i bought this as a christmas gift for someone it came in the mail very quickly i had no problems with it and the person i gave it to loved it,positive
the movie is excellent i was hoping to find the directors cut with additional footage but the regular dvd is excellent as well not many additional features but the movie is delightful and although slightly longer then some holds the viewers interest minor amounts of nudity some very graphic fist fighting but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot one of ron howard s best films,positive
my wife and i huge fans of america s next top model and project runway were very excited about seeing this film why it took us this long still baffles me but as of friday night we had the pleasure of seeing the devil wears prada and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure now most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of meryl streep and while she was outstanding this film is more than just a meryl painted canvas there are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise first is anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as miranda priestly assistant at runway magazine anne hathaway proves with her performance that she s all grown up no that s not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like havoc and the masterpiece brokeback mountain but here anne proves that she can do adult comedy not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in the princess diaries but keeping everything smart and mature she has enough poise and grace to match wits with miranda and she does so elegantly next up is emily blunt who plays emily miranda s first assistant \( there are two andrea being the second \) emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is slaving for the unruly priestly and it s all about to pay off with a trip alongside miranda to paris the only thing standing in her way is andrea for if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on emily emily blunt turns out i think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her stanley tucci also does wonderfully here as nigel miranda s second in command he is there to make sure everything is perfect and also help andrea adjust stanley always has done great backup work playing second hand man to just about everyone but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it he delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the token gay guy he s needed in this film not filler and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd and then of course we have meryl streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as miranda priestly what i was most impressed about was the way meryl underplays every word every emotion every scene which is not what i expected i really expected her to go all glen close and reincarnate cruella but she didn t \( thankfully \) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year she must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor in chief of runway she lets us see inside her character briefly \( when crying over another failed marriage \) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don t get to see the real miranda because we re not supposed to carried by these four brilliant performances the devil wears prada is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone the script is brilliantly adapted from lauren weisberger s novel and while it s not an exact replica \( are any adaptations these days \) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and in my eyes more enjoyable bravo,positive
a boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there and they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk they go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up in other words this movie is vintage decoteau it defies all known logic \( the boy shows up for his college interview is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents \) has lame effects and lots of half naked boys it s hard to tell if this is a commentary on the catholic church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed definitely another laugh riot from the director of such classics as leeches and leather jacket love story,negative
i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i can t believe how disappointed i am for this i was expecting fireworks instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head not only that but it maybe the most over the top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like what is the meaning then there s the film s signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera again i said to myself what s the point and then there s the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory s character getting shot in the head in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because oswald realized that he was raymond shaw if he s right that raises the question did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of the manchurian candidate and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 s what it is and why people today \( including me \) are still obessed with that decade in conclusion i think this was a big disappoinment and this movie is on the list of afi s 100 greatest films please,negative
with an all star cast the plot is not new \( stage door how to marry a millionaire and valley of the dolls to mention but a few \) but judy hedy and lana do an admirable job never mind highbrow critcs hedy lamarr wasn t that bad and lana does one of her best acting jobs ever judy is a tomboy and it s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of lana s character sheila the musical numbers are good but sadly footage from the great ziegfeld are edited in \( note the finale \) james stewart are good as well as are edvard everett horton charles winninger and eve arden the film is filled with good 1 liners and there are even echoes of garbo s first sound entrance in anna christie,positive
following the series of firefly serenity continues the story line for a few more steps there are so many ways this movie is packed i cannot begin to properly mention them here the storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a solving the mystery approach the english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing the animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality the characters are complex focused solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations the challenges the crew of serenity face are many from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority alliance forces to the overt mortal threat of the reavers the climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue the music in serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more i suggest seeing the series firefly before watching the movie serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters,positive
hilarious from beginning to end dr pearl er eugene levy will you marry me,positive
it is obvious that this movie is full of lies although i have not actually seen it i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel \( god bless them \) the way he attacks poor mr heston is deplorable can t michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he doesn t have his faculties about him i am also unsure that mr heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing making it appear that my president \( heston \) is an uncaring babbling idiot by simply using his own words shame on you michael and as for the way he got the gun from the bank i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn t give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank bravo to those who figured that out also michael moore is fat take that pinkie,negative
i agree that this is technically an excellent film but it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with richard widmark s character his enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism but in the end he doesn t just lose he is literally thrown away as garbage and then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take all in all i was left with the question what is the point the commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well its basicly a description of what you re watching while you re watching it i see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so i ll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie,negative
i was more than impressed by this stupendous documentary not only is it superior photogrqphically speaking not only does it have beautiful inspiring music it is factual and should open our eyes to what we have to lose in the name of oil we need to understand why environmentalists and educated elected officials care about protecting this pristine area i was born raised and educated in one of the most beautiful places in the u s in boulder co at the foot of the flatirons but i truly feel this alaska wilderness is god s country buy this dvd view it invite everyone you care about to view it with you you wll begin to care and maybe just maybe you will help to preserve it for your children generations after you are gone,positive
this one is an old favorite of mine which i pre ordered on dvd the instant i learned it was available i have an old vhs recording of the film which i have viewed many times i have also read the book many times and i consider it to be conroy s best work this is the story of four young men at carolina military institute a fictional military academy located in south carolina which is of course a pseudonym for the citadel which is a fine military academy that really does exist the film is set in the 1960s the first black cadet \( first year cadets are called knobs at the institute \) has just arrived a secret society within the institute known as the ten has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the institute regardless of ability david keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet s designated mentor the plot moves at a fast pace but nevertheless does not feel rushed purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub plots contained in the novel i feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries i liked the script the acting and the ending this is a wonderful film it is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years and i am delighted that it will shortly be available on dvd,positive
i was disappointed in this video i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos in other words i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton s antarctic exploration or something from the globe trekker series with that in mind the target audience for this video is not me it is the religious catholic therefore from my perspective i can t recommend it i m not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion i don t enjoy worshipping the holy father or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video if you are not and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican you are likely to be disappointed and that is what these reviews are for to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not,negative

i won t go into the movie itself as other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that suffice to say that i have always enjoyed cloak dagger despite the hokiness of some of the scenes \( not to mention the laughable visuals at the end \) this movie still rates at least 4 stars from me however amazon reviews are supposed to cover the entire product and not just the movie itself in two words it stinks no trailer no subtitles no scene selections no extras of any kind not even a menu when you slide the disc in the movie starts right up when the movie finishes it starts over again if you press the menu button on your remote nothing happens personally i d prefer it if after the movie finished playback would stop and you d go to a scene selection menu even a still image telling you the movie was over would be better than playback looping back forever i suppose i should be glad universal even bothered to release this movie on dvd it s just disappointing that they obviously didn t put any thought or effort into it,negative
this is a must own film i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end daniel berhardt is god,positive
and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i m 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i didn t for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what s considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved,negative
i enjoyed francis veber s the closet released in france in 2001 for two reasons first it features an all star ensemble of french acting certainly a tribute to veber s skill as a director just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits daniel auteuil fran ois pignon g rard depardieu f lix santini thierry lhermitte guillaume mich le laroque mlle bertrand michel aumont belone the neighbour jean rochefort kopel the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber s reputation his previous release 1998 s the dinner game was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece actors get attracted to that type of skill the second reason i got a kick out of watching the closet i just learned that bend it like beckham writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release with chadha at the helm her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham s runaway success so i feel like i m in on a really great secret knowing she s working on a re make,positive
hollywood make them then they break them stars can fall as fast as they rise sometimes they rise again and sometimes they disappear and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in the big picture a quirky cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of it has a few awkward stretches but overall it s a darkly witty cult comedy \( you re tracking failure all over my carpet \) nick chapman \( kevin bacon \) is the winner at an arty student movie competition and instantly agents are chasing him all over l a in no time he s the rising young director with a movie deal at a major movie corporation but he s also starting to lose sight of his old life as he tries to become a major success he changes the style plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics turning it into a beach bums naked ghost movie he dumps his pretty girlfriend \( emily longstreth \) for a bimbo actress \( teri hatcher \) when the studio head gets dropped nick falls as quickly as he rose but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance an arty music video this time can he get it right christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries tackling everything from small town musicals to folk festivals his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz but his talents are just as present in a typical movie and guest does a smart quirky job of it the lesson be true to yourself and your art don t fall for empty glitz and don t let success go to your head if you re lucky enough to get it the story is a pretty straightforward one nick gets great success it goes to his head he falls and he rises again a wiser man and the movie falls into straightforward lines without many unpredictable plot twists at first glance it doesn t seem that unusual what makes it special well simply put guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick s life not to mention the glorious dialogue when speaking of nick s one n only music video a studio woman announces it s the best one yet and i ve seen em all and guest manages to show us agents artists students directors and actors but never descended to cliches they re real people no matter how nasty and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet where he confesses i wanna be your friend again and he s backed by good performances by longstreth michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh big picture treads where many movies have gone before but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video a must see,positive
these are excellent performances for a very reasonable price the look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is dated but the performances easily shine through not quite as well played recorded or filmed as bernstein s many later unitel films but still well worth the investment i won t spend time on details but rest assured it s all great stuff,positive
the fake news tv movie had already be done and done better ten years ealier as special bulletin where the first movie took its subject nuclear disarmament and terrorism seriously this cheese fest doesn t respect the viewers intelligence at all they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera not of it ties together in any coherent way and the make love not war ending reeks of junior high school sophistry,negative
this dvd is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes first scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record but the ghost of cab crag isn t too happy about having his record broken then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor and what s with the worm worshipers i mean they go like whoo a giant worm is our god whoo we hate cars then they go to the bocephus wrestling facility could they come up with a better name than bocephus there s a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister the last episode is by far the best a hockey ghost is terrorizing the world cup hockey event he s one of the toughest ghosts ever either that or the russian police are the biggest whimps ever i think this dvd is a good buy if you are a scooby fan just be prepared it can get a little goofy joey,positive
this movie works if one of the following four descriptions applies to you 1 you think kevin zegers is hot you want to see anything he s in and the swimming scene in transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first had a peanut butter sandwich 2 you think nick carter is hot and want to see if he can act \( he can t \) 3 you like horror movies no matter how bad they are simply because it s a horror movie 4 for some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested in what judge reinhold is doing with his career within the first five minutes of the film i had it pegged as a friday the 13th style movie within the first five minutes it was then it expanded a bit and we saw some interplay between father and son and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic angst in this rendition the headless horseman actually had a head it was a pumpkin and it growled there was also some serious fire that he was capable of apparently in the beginning this fire was not with him when he needed it the most and of course he used a sword to decapitate victims lucky then that kevin zegers character was on the fencing team \( odd for such a small town to have a fencing team don t you think \) and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end well you get the picture judge reinhold was a riot in the 80s in this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things were when he played ball i can t imagine a universe in which reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his players about he would have died during his first game he did though walk around the house with a football jersey on and some silly pajama pants so i guess that fit the role of a football coach still all in all i was certain that this review would be a one star review then it came out of the jason woods and became marginally better i was interested in the film for two reasons first i m still waiting to see if kevin zegers can act i have a feeling that he s going to break out of the horror mold he s in and become a lesser jamie lee curtis unfortunately in transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager they didn t give him room i e they didn t write anything for him that would have allowed him to express any range either that or he doesn t have any second i do like horror films even bad ones which this was just because i enjoy bad horror films doesn t make it a good movie which this wasn t i was just about to post this review then saw the three four and five star reviews i m sorry what were you guys smoking when you watched this are you kidding me as a bad horror film this succeeds but bad horror films don t get three four or five star reviews it s insane,negative
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes aren t we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast \( from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc \) can turn candy into cuisine,negative
my impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor it s all style no substance i got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks long slow camara pans across stephen dorff s very trendy and stylish haircut and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with despite the very art house feel of it the story is lost the viewer is never quite sure if the philosophy of the main character is meant to be taken seriously and the style is nothing we haven t seen done better other places all in all i found it pretty vapid painfully slow and incredibly frustrating because there is a good movie in here somewhere if only the script had gone to someone else to make on a side note toby maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went,negative
having just read the book \( most highly recommended \) i decided to treat myself to the movie i could have cried while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around in the book the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character in the movie they got rid of one man had the other eaten right off the bat pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy in the book nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters and he does not have an elaborate home on the island and what about those stupid giant animals i don t recall reading about them the fence around nemo s home looks like it came right from jurassic park the whole story was about 5 \( eventually 6 \) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there on another note the graphics were pretty bad the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy as one reviewer well said it is suitable for children who are easily pleased but it is nothing like the book perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only 6 99,negative
this movie was cheeseball beginning to end i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway big mistake a robot who can love lame and with all this high tech stuff the docs can t bring the couple s real son out of a coma \( or whatever was wrong with him \) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can love but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone brialliant plan \( especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world \) then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin the family decides they don t want the robot and the mom loves him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy the worst part was the end ugh i don t even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism for those of you who have not seen it i suggest renting it before you buy it maybe this movie is great for some people it just wasn t my thing,negative

a true love it or hate it movie my reaction fits closer with the first group this gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound the parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills while her son tries to make a living dealing although he his partner and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits the director s jarring style fits the subject matter well and ellen burstyn s performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing julia roberts beat her for best actress in 2000 with erin brockovich which was a fine role and performance but burstyn was in another world those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense i can understand the second objection hence four stars rather than five note i got this movie from netflix i m not sure if i was watching the director s cut or not,positive

i first saw this movie around 1980 when the cold war was still on i had been inundated with propaganda from birth that all russians talked about was political that they didn t do normal things or live a normal life all politics you know well here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women it was very well acted and basically just a long soap i loved it and not one word about lenin marx or anti americanisms i recently saw it again and liked it just as much for those who say it is unrealistic well how do you know do you think that all russians lived the exact same life or because american cold war propaganda stated that all russians were totally miserable,positive
was surprised by the price compared to other movies but it was worth it,positive

the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson s third major motion picture the movie revolves around a rich but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum \( gene hackman \) royal and his wife etheline \( angelica huston \) had three children chas \( ben stiller \) margot \( gwyneth paltrow \) and richie \( luke wilson \) in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america s premier families margot was a famous playwright richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u s nationals and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten betrayal failure and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died what s worse is that royal s children and wife blame him for all their failures royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend pagoda \( kumar pallana \) royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family s eyes i m a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films the royal tenenbaums is anderson s most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture however it is my least favorite of his movies like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family a theme that i enjoy yet the film just didn t resonate with me as much as anderson s other pictures i really don t know why that is that s not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it s not in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting brilliant set designs etc i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic drama about a sea voyaging documentarian instead,positive

this film is visually stunning and impressive and has talented and credible actors unfortunately there is barely a story with a lot of poorly developed characters who are trained brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity the settings and group sermons from nazi officials are striking and convincing but there is nothing that ties it all together our hero fails to strike the killer blow and is stripped literally and figuratively of all status and walks away the end i m forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film and i was surprised by how un gay it was in fact the two boy friends work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress it s more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else i have issues with some of the pacing as well i found myself pressing the fast forward button several times and didn t really seem to miss much not a good sign so for what it is it s okay certainly not a masterpiece and certainly not something to run out and buy,negative
this is a godawful movie a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the sexy health club craze of the 80s actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so,negative
highly acclaimed that i knew i watched the first 30 minutes which is 1 4 of the movie before i decided to hang it up new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop this upsets the local church even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate okay can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot nope this one s boring,negative
hello fellow amazon ers out there in cyber land \) i grew up in the mi tv series era as a tv dvd collector of primarily 60 s 80 s series and member of a couple of tv dvd forums on the net i can mention to all of the amazon ers out there that this is a gem that we ve been wanting on dvd for years as for some of the cruise posts i saw the 1st mi film and as others mentioned here it s somewhat like comparing apples and oranges from a tv dvd collectors point of view we want the \( tv series remake \) films released since in a lot of cases the studios will release the original tv dvd series as a market tie in coinciding with the film release tv dvd collectors may not purchase the film on dvd but in a lot of cases the film gets the job done for the tv series release my favorite season of this series was s1 i liked steven hill in the imf force team leader role just a little better than peter graves although i thought graves did an outstanding job in the role after hill left the series i also liked the original script line of please dispose of this recording in the usual manner \) what can we say about the landau bain team on this show classic and what a casting jackpot for greg morris in the tech electronics genius role \) this series is a must buy for most of the tv dvd collectors out there it s simply put a sure thing gem for your collection i only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release s as the saying goes it s all about the s \( sales s \) hopefully this set will sell well on the net stores and your local outlets as always should any of your dvd s dislodge from their hubs in transit the shipper will disavow any knowledge of their existance \) signing off from dallas tx this poster may self destruct in 5 seconds,positive

there can t be a better storyteller than teddy ruxpin as i child i was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy teddy ruxpin as i waited for saturday morning to come again so i could see another episode of the tv series this show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one so many cartoons are just one shots an individual small plot for each episode teddy ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure along the way kids learn important morals values and a lot about their own world this is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age and what a great price well worth it,positive
i resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years i make it 200 the other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler i just loved the u s air force personnel with scottish and english accents they must have overrun the 500 budget at that point,negative

afi finally release a live dvd and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now it is very impressive it does lack older more hardcore punk tracks but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the band it is now each album progresses towards more epic scales and songs balance beauty with power i heard a voice captures this on film and the fan gets to witness afi at their most grandiose watching vocalist davey havok sing god called in sick today while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime the masterful command of theatrics from each member especially havok creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate the setlist itself is perfectly put together with the only gripe being the exclusion of kiss and control the rest of the songs display all facets of afi from the fast paced dancing through sunday \( which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist jade puget \) kill caustic death of seasons totalimmortal and a single second \( the last of which features a guest appearance by nick 13 of tiger army \) to the slower paced this time imperfect and endlessly she said as well as all of their recent singles and a few more cuts from their latest releases decemberunderground and sing the sorrow extras are geared towards the fans with despair faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the decemberunderground release as well as a poster each band member has their moments to shine and are all very capable and talented muscians bassist hunter burgan and drummer adam carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals as puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery in this genre over the instrument this is all built up to allow havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you the quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic unlike other live dvd s where the concert is edited to the point of a music video i heard a voice has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd but also add to the overall effect of the performance the sound is very clear and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix this is overall a very stellar production and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band as well as new fans and casual fans should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy,positive
this is an excellent story well told in script and action however it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends,negative
sorry i couldn t come up with a better punchline but this movie doesn t deserve any original thought or ideas maybe its because there aren t any original ideas in this movie event national lampoon used to mean funny now its french for crapola avoid this one at all costs watch caddyshack ii airplane ii yes even xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one,negative
how he makes money acting is amazing to me these hollywood versions of a fake historic events make me cringe especially when hollywood exec s send their talent to making the rounds on talk shows to plug the painful blockbuster that s going to be a big flop and they know it but they think people are stupid \( and most of us are \) but hollywood hates to lose money so they put a spin on it anyway i d laugh if it wern t so sad anyway tom s army unit was choosen to update the japanese army at the request of the puppet emperor but really it s the emperor s councelor who makes all the decisions so the evil councelor decides to westernize his army the samuri swordsmen must be totally destroyed tom accidently on purpose kills a samuri and feels bad so he tries to make it up to the wife and son then he realizes a brutal beauty to the life of a samuri and joins them it s very paint by the numbers story and acting even the japanese landscape is boring of course the u s army is painted as bad guys when the whole blame for the mess and bloodshed that follows can be put squarely on the shoulders of the weak emperor who didn t have the guts to put things right with the samuri in the first place then tommy has some kind of ephifany and decides to stay in japan snore this movie was too long and with all the money spent on this movie it really could have been a 1 2 decent semi historic story about the destruction of the samuri in japan,negative
i think if charles bukowski dylan thomas and fellini collaborated on a piece of writing it s possible they would have come up with this screenplay this movie is exciting because it s soooo different from anything i ve ever seen deliciously non linear the substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that s the destiny of artist movies i loved hearing the dialog and kristofferson s acting is the best i ve ever seen by him anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people \( like other reviewers here \) but if you ask me that only validates the work if ever i go to new york city the hotel chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit my favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator who after claiming to have had a conversation with dylan thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the chelsea because people will listen to them there the dvd extras contain a couple of quirky interviews one with director ethan hawke and the other with robert sean leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film,positive
this movie was so horrible i don t know where to start maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street or maybe he just casted his own family at any rate they were untrained and stale secondly i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi christian plays why wouldn t this movie director have enough sense to follow suit if you re trying to actually sale to a christian audience furthermore i thought the bible said a little something against divorce like it wasn t permitted unless your spouse commits adultery fornication this movie seems to say it s okay to go against the word of god if you re in love in fact christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice by even the protagonist i laugh as i think of the scene where ce ce peniston s character says seductively i m looking for a man with his mind on jesus yet she s dressed like a hooker speaking of clothing why did ce ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene they go on a date and she s dressed one way by the time they come home she has on something different with no logical explanation and please explain why they had someone s grandfather playing the role of rico suave maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman s dream i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him in addition the soundtrack it was just annoying at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music i just wanted the maddness to stop lastly it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate \( although some are \) however having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just well almost juvenile perhaps even a disrespect to women at large overall this movie made me want to puke pastor larry flash jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity,negative

from a serious u2 fan s perspective the best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs the bonus material is cool the sound quality s great the visuals are always impressive but it s the songs that are the real attraction as it should be two scorching rockers from their criminally ignored debut album boy four in a row from the all time masterpiece achtung baby and nearly everything from their grammy sweeping triumph how to dismantle an atomic bomb i also love that they chose to not play anything from their string of disappointing nineties albums good call also many familiar songs are given exciting new treatments such as running to stand still \( a perfect hybrid of the joshua tree and zoo tv versions \) elevation \( longer better build up \) bullet the blue sky \( check out edge s extended blues jam in the final minutes \) and original of the species \( acoustic piano ballad \) this was the first major u2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set list for instance when i saw them they played miss sarajevo stuck in a moment gloria i still haven t found what i m looking for instant karma until the end of the world and others not represented here here s hoping they release at least one more vertigo tour dvd,positive
i m not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the season 1 2 box sets which is how you re better off seeing them \( at least they re in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes \) instead i will be focusing on the bonus features not the violent femmes music video because that too can be found on the season 1 box set but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features i love the interviews and the in studio voice recording re enactments but i hate how every piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame you can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen and even then it isn t clear as there s a bubble shine over it i d love for paramount nick to include all of the original non bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2,negative
let s face it tinseltown has run out of original story lines that s usually when they turn to remakes i ve seen several remakes over the years both tv and movie but this is one of the best remakes i ve seen in quite some time i really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line what a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing to do with the tv show and pulled all of it s story from the comic book if you were never into comics to begin with then you can t appreciate the story line another thing that i feel is under appreciated about this movie is the cgi people have to understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of time the amount of man hours that went in to creating the cgi is something to be applauded and appreciated not mocked and thrown out with the trash you have to appreciate the movie for the story line and its artistic value most people were upset with this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should have been more fun and had a lot more action in it the story of the hulk is a sad depressing dramatic story there isn t anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about something the hulk wasn t meant to be campy it was meant to be serious my only gripe about this movie is that they could have picked a better actress to play banner s love interest the little amount of screen time she was given was completely wasted,positive
what was john singleton thinking i know he produces good films but this is far worse the shaft from the 70s was sexier cooler more aggressive and classer than jackson this was a watered down verison where parks and roundtree made cameos it s almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character no love making and ect don t even waist your time if you want to see it check it out on cable tv or something save your money,negative
the freshman is a very funny movie the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed matthew broderick is the freshman an innocent nyu film student who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his family the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild bad words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families,positive

brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them this is a blatant effort to wrench young children s emotions and therefore their perspectives about the eeeevil effects of global warming by engaging their sympathies the only plot is brainwashing using penguins as the straw man the penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them as a responsible parent i would avoid this entirely,negative

i bought basically because i love denisee richards and daryl hanna plus i like also valerie tasso besides i am a fan of pierre woodman they all appear on the film among some well know adult stars like dora venter rita faltoyano but really the film is not good at all it is slow the elements don t match it is sometimes hard to follow it is really not worth buying it,negative
having an m a in english literature as well as a b a in literature and history anytime a movie is both historical and literary well i get a bit excited to say the least i don t wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it s not but the writers directors producers set it against a historical backdrop nonetheless on that note this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott with that being said i enjoyed tristan and isolde almost as much as gladiator and a bit more than kingdom of heaven \( all of these by the way are ridley scott films \) notice the historical adaptations here while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare s romeo and juliet as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend this movie is not exclusively for the high browed college types no sir good ol red blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie this is by no means a chick flick since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense on the other hand it s not the typical hack and slash macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story in short it should please both sexes simultaneously aside from james franco \( tristan \) i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast sophia myles \( isolde \) is for the most part a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king \( who just so happens to be isolde s father \) in short this is one of the best movies i ve seen in awhile on some levels it reminds me of king arthur just as king arthur attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur guinevere and lancelot so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england if you ll recall in king arthur arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal but oh well it made for a good story here we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea what the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around well tristan and isolde holds true to history in this aspect namely that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo saxons this would of course have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall and this is exactly where the movie is set let s not forget the story of saint patrick remember he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity it s interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new fangled religion in ireland so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand i particulary liked king arthur and kingdom of heaven despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics critically speaking tristan and isolde has been a bit of a mixed bag as well but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics rent it first if you must but i suspect this one will be a keeper in your dvd library,positive
when this show was on back in the day on fox i couldnt believe i was actually watching something i could relate to there doesnt seem to be really that many tv shows that deal with dark and the real life experinces of real people if ya ask me when it was on it was actually something that gave me some relief i deal everyday with some experinces re lated to the show its somewhat of a constant battle enough about me im really glad all 3 seasons are out and im also glad i didnt have to wait many years either one thing i didnt like about fox when titus was on they kept moveing it around it wasnt fair for the show then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone im not really happy with fox cause titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did i hope chris shows up in something else soon hes got one of those faces ya never forget,positive
this is one of my all time favorite vampire movies the cast led by tom cruise as the vampire lestat and brad pitt as the vampire louis does an excellent job of bringing to life anne rice s interview with the vampire the costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through and the cinematography is lush and sensual evoking the decadent lifestyle that lestat leads even kirsten dunst has a role here as a child vampire and her famous line i want some more has been rendered immortal in movie history the chemistry between lestat cruise louis pitt is believable and in fact they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie all in all a cinematic treat,positive

this one of those movies that i can watch over and over again the story is great acting is good and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best the force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity i would love to go on a tornado hunt the special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie i would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars the loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts rent it buy it watch it it is well worth your time and money,positive
let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language,negative

in this movie we once again see mad max \( sans hot car \) wandering around in a post apocalyptic world until he discovers bartertown in the wasteland mel gibson tries valiantly to channel such on screen loners as clint eastwood and john wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social skills however he becomes a threat to the matriarch of the town by the name of aunty emteevee \( or something like that \) then mel kicks a lot of butt in the process this is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the outback opal mining town of coober pedy which i visited a few years ago,positive

i checked this out because i wanted to take a look at what the new doctor who people have been doing in the recent past the second coming isn t quite as cosmic but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy steve baxter \( christopher eccleston \) has an epiphany one night when he s out on the town with some mates he reckons he s become the son of god and he proceeds to turn night into day at maine road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely chosen status \( a bit like david icke except with powers \) his immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the new disciples some of them notably judith his girlfriend \( lesley sharp \) remain sceptical through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a third testament it later transpires that if they do not the end of the world will soon follow what are this messiah s credentials well he spends forty days in the wilderness which is saddleworth moor and he has no earthly father it turns out that his dad is infertile and couldn t have fathered him this tickled me did writer russell t davis pass his gcse in religious studies do we think i couldn t really work out whether the religious symbolism was unconsciously corny and na ve or whether it aimed at giving us a laugh i d like to think the latter steve curiously isn t what we might describe as spiritual certainly not religious he swears all the time boozes and although not quite loutish is somewhat laddish he s a laddish messiah his disciples swear at him and he insults them back \( message to southerners we in the north are not all like this despite the plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise preston front our friends in the north etc writers do seem to have this desire to patronise us thus \) what s noticeable about the founders of the major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree of religious wisdom steve who just witters nonsensically to the crowds seems to lack this facility is he meant to be devoid of wisdom are we asking too much of russell t davis to place some in his mouth could he have done so had he wished presumably our writer would need to possess some himself \( jury s out \) it turns out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme s message so what happens despite almost two hours of waiting for judgement day with little action or plot development we eventually come to learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib he ends up at the girlfriend s home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or epitome of human religiosity enlightened humanity judith finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him and she spits him out they argue for a while before atheism wins out and steve chomps down the poisoned pasta \( after the two hours i found myself saying bon appetit \) so we get the sermon although it s a secular one which declares the futility of religious belief but this messiah seemed to me to be almost devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway you can t debunk what doesn t exist steve can t be a foil for atheism if he is a kind of atheism i suppose that we do end up questioning russell t davis s understanding of spirituality not to say he should necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality but perhaps to understand it to come degree and yes there is a naivety and a corniness which underpins all this third form philosophy typical of so many young people working within the arts it s a pity that the message of the piece couldn t have been delivered within the actual context of the drama itself what we have is a two hour tv play followed by a secular sermon subtext puked out and all we do have an epilogue however where our new found heroine is hilariously transfigured at the supermarket i do recommend the second coming for amusement but for enlightenment you d better have something else to hand,negative

why the production team of this movie didn t film in new orleans is beyond my comprehension when i first saw this movie i could see based on the footage that it was filmed in canada the terrain is totally different from south louisiana it looked like a movie set i guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other it looked like a theme park the streets looked too clean for some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old new orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people s lives but maybe i am being too technical all the principle characters all had straight teeth and clear skin back in the 1840 s just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it the actor who played marcel could not act the actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years still looked the same yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before the architecture of the plantation house was also wrong it was nt even french no live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern louisiana the supporting actors and actresses were quite good let me just say this white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in new orleans but also other states in the south the difference is is that in new orleans the white master would leave them property and money not so in other southern states the more beautiful the woman the more she would receive from the white man the placage system in new orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties,negative

david lean s the bridge on the river kwai like jean renoir s grand illusion is an anti heroic war film set in a prisoner of war camp environment but there the point of resemblance came to an end the bridge on the river kwai is an adventure film in which the nature of world war ii is explored and if in grand illusion the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity in the bridge on the river kwai they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge blown up escape is almost impossible from the japanese camp located near the kwai river in burma the prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards the camp commander is a rigid psychopath conditions are hard to bear psychological state of the war british prisoners in constant alteration into the presumptuous situation comes colonel nicholson \( alec guinness in a fascinating performance \) a strict serene dedicated british officer deeply concerned for the welfare of his men nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn japanese colonel saito \( sessue hayakawa \) for insisting on his attachment to the geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him but his obsession has risen to near madness he agrees to help the japanese build their bridge and in his determination to find victory in defeat he ignores that the bridge which he insists must be a proper bridge will serve the japanese objectives against the british troops in addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code a third element in the story is introduced a small commando team led by major warden \( jack hawkins \) and an american sailor \( william holden \) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge the film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax a japanese train and a commando force directed to a same goal the brige of the river kwai each character in the motion picture has a valid reason for what he is doing and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane the bridge on the river kwai hits with war in a compelling logic of events the indulgence of self destruction with a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune march the bridge on the river kwai is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men,positive

while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid summer weather we ended up renting analyze that and boy what a mistake that was we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 s analyze this the potential was there it s not as if writers \( of course it s never a good sign to see numerous writers \) peter tolan peter steinfeld and harold ramis didn t have decent material to work with robert deniro billy crystal lisa kudrow and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy however this being hollywood and all another sequel was botched it s because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some fish out of water situations the movie seemed to go downhill soon after the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over the top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as crossroads now either they ran out of jokes they didn t have enough time to invest in an actual story or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already \( the sopranos the whole 9 yards mickey blue eyes etc etc \) that there was simply nothing left to write about,negative

ok so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina s breasts the acting was poor the script was stupid and the sets were lame i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time \( ie killer kondom \) but this one took the cake i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day save your money if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week,negative

i saw this movie years ago but didn t remember much about it except some of the songs and the basic story i also saw nights of cabiria from which the story was taken i love musicals and i think shirley maclaine is very talented she is very sweet as charity hope valentine and one can t help wanting a happy ending for her so why did i think this movie was awful first of all some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating how many times can you listen to charity say fickle finger of fate over and over without wanting to hit the mute button also some of the scenes went on and on and on especially the elevator scene and the intermission was totally unnecessary but the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers i didn t like any of them they were so far over the top as to be silly bob fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers he had so much busyness in all of them too many people costumes that didn t fit the story silly moves and they all went past the point of enjoyment i fast forwarded thru a couple of them just to get them over with i have never done that before with any movie this could have been so much better the story was good the charactors were good but the whole thing should have been toned down the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming it was entirely too long also all that stop action what was that all about i know i know it was to show the progress of the story but it was a distraction i didn t like the movie and was glad when it was over,negative
daniel deronda is george eliot s 1876 novel dealing with the rise of zionism incarnated in young daniel deronda sadly but truly this is the first major english novel giving a positive view of the jewish people deronda is raised by the wealthy sir malinger as an english gentleman in the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a jew meets his mother and is the love object of two fascinating women mirah lapidoth is the jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by daniel her love for daniel burgeons as she comes to know and love the kind young man gwendolyn harleth played by the brilliant acting of romola garai is the spoiled impecunious husband hunter who weds the rich cad grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates she loves deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of psychological combat like all bbc productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear this tale runs about four hours and is a joy many american viewers may be dismayed at the slow leisurely pace of british productions please remember that these productions are based on long english novels which were published in several monthly parts they are long but they are also wonderful explorations of the human soul gwendolyn s story is a bildungsroman in which she grows as a person ditto for deronda who learns to take pride in his hebrew heritage this is a worthy bbc production well worth the viewer s time and money,positive
less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor in like flint still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world s women while replacing powerful males with surgically altered substitutes \( leading to perhaps the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be a disbelieving flint says an actor as president \) that is until a renegade zowie general \( steve inhat \) decides it s his turn to take the reins of power the delightful lee j cobb is back as flint s curmudgeonly boss cramden as are the secret agent s posse of female admirers and tv s batgirl yvonne craig even shows up as a russian ballerina in like flint feels more grown up than the previous film partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind and charging a premium for them are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows cross dressing and the bouncing sing a long ball only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment as it s a staple of the genre meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort a no frills dvd,positive
i ve never been quite a fan of music dvds by that i mean the live stuff i much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending i m there that s one side of it i m also a huuuuuge gorillaz fan and i have seen them live the show to their self titled debut but don t get me wrong that doesn t make me biased towards everything they put out on the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because i only expect the best from what they ve given with that said this has to be literally one of the best music dvds i have encountered in quite some time don t worry about extras documentaries which while would have been nice to show how it was put together are not here which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn t show you all that the show itself was amazing and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this and i recommend you have a decent audio system as well the amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well the editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another dvd to sell from start to end it will leave you speechless as you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the gorillaz you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level you can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level and to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself if you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other dvds especially now since they just released their newest one those will fill in all that nicely but even if you re not a fan or just a new convert i highly recommend you own this no matter the age or person you are \( you notice this on the dvd as well \) and regardless of what your favourite genre is because they are so massive they can t be contained into one thank you damon and jamie for such an experience mates,positive
though this movie is not the stage version it is just as good bill benson \( bing crosby \) and ted adams \( donald o conner \) decide to do a broadway show together however they need a leading lady well ted and the director decide that if bill should run across the right girl sign her so bill sets off to paris and ted for london well bill discovers a girl \( mitzy gaynor \) not knowing that ted found and signed a girl in paris \( jeanmaire \) when the two find out it is total chaos especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home all the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave things seem to be going fine until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady the movie has great porter songs de lovely anything goes second hand turban blow gabe blow i get a kick out of you you re the top and a fabulous tap number with donald you can bounce right back phil harris also stars in this fantastic de lovely movie,positive
somehow this movie touched my heart and my mind and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime however it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things like first love impossible to re capture and in a sense haunting i am not obsessive in any way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times with each time revealing another layer of meaning and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles maybe their best ever in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category so buy it and watch it you ll be glad you did mik,positive
i have very fond memories of this short lived irwin allen classic the picture and sound on the dvd s is better than i remember the video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono i give volume one of the time tunnel five stars for pure television enjoyment volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show the unaired extended version of the pilot irwin allen s behind the scenes home movies visual effects camera test still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots once again it is lacking in cast interviews many of the actors from this show are still alive so why didn t the studio interview them for the dvd set it would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought s on the show my only gripe is that this show only ran for one season so why split it into two volumes surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price,positive
i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen what bothers me the most is that the general public who hasn t read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject i won t go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie,negative

i don t consider myself a hardocre 50 cent fan but i went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of xxl it wasn t all that entertaining the documentary doesn t really tell the people anything that we don t already know we ve seen all these videos before but the video for heat is straight wack the street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny the show in detroit isn t entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that s being said the sessions aol are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 mile dvd trailer the dvd borders on corny but the cd isn t that bad these are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs but i had not been able to find the 8 mile road \( g unit remix \) ever since i lost my underground cd lloyd banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this cd dvd release if you re a young buck fan you should know that he s nowhere to be found on this release overall the new breed isn t completely terrible but it loses its novelty after one or two uses the three songs on the cd are decent but you probably have them already i would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 cent g unit fans,negative

this is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning one does not need to love the results of these changes \( i personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it even as i marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election \) to appreciate how clinton s 1992 campaign as seen in this film changed the american political world war room should be seen along with more recent documentaries \( like for example staffers 04 \) to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal \( to be elected rather than to govern \) hopefully it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless mind numbing dumbing down assessments of candidate traits \( like character or integrity \) we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years,positive

this is a well written thoughtful film charlie hunnam \( pete \) really stands out to me he s perfectly cast compelling to watch and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his mates it was especially interesting to watch his relationship with elijah wood s character evolve the whole concept of an american being immersed in the british football scene is a unique one and i think it was pulled off really well the lessons that elijah wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must see,positive
i really didn t enjoy the movie but i had to finish it the hypocrisy of faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so called fundamentalist that i know but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying this movie presented a very perverted view of christianity though there was alot of talking about jesus and saying his name it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually knew him and spent time with him when mary gets a revelation from something she believes is christ that opposed the actual word of god she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against his word no one actually reads a bible in the movie consequently most made many life damaging decisions i hated the reality of the movie but it has challenged me to actually spend time with christ and learn about him i shudder to think that i could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what christianity truly is,negative
this movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing it presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes it takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience it is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace it is full of laughs joe pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time i don t think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of vinny nearly as well marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great the writing and directing two things that often get overlooked was wonderful the only weakness the case is a little fantastic it is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime of course movie plots don t have to make perfect sense but this stretches it though i usually don t like excessive foul language this movie uses it in a funny way i guess it wouldn t work without it but don t be mistaken it has a lot of bad language don t let kids under 17 watch it without supervision,positive

it seems to me there s a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era i m not arguing it s either better or worse than others it just feels different and very distinctive in this light wall street reminded me vividly of no way out for instance which happens to be from 1987 as well and several de palma films don t ask me why it just does useless considerations apart wall street directed by always controversial oliver stone pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away they always burn out in a snap of fingers and bigger they are harder they fall right the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen featuring a bright young sport bud fox \( played by charlie sheen \) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life he wants more and hotshot gordon gekko \( michael douglas \) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become powerful vicious influential and a sure winner by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence bud sneaks into gekko s office and tries to prove his value to him from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average but rather well executed in this particular instance story of the young proteg who rises to the top at breakneck speed until unexpectedly something shatters his bond to the master something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie so i ll let that for you to find out if you didn t see it yet all the acting is quite superb especially the relationship between gekko and fox martin sheen who is charlie sheen s father both in real life and on the screen is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work not selling out and not letting others and yourself down he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he s on screen a couple of minutes at a time if you like high finance intrigue big guys pulling the strings on each other twists and turns then wall street is probably essential and it will probably give you an excuse to read sun tzu s the art of war,positive
clownhouse is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor while hearing of salva s conviction when jeepers creepers came out i never knew it had anything to do with this movie nor had i ever heard of this in the first place i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides it and came across this weird little halloween like suspense tale while the sex scandal never once popped into my head \( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid \) i still didn t care for this too much despite its pluses like halloween this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out but sadly it didn t really get to me if i was about 9 or so this would ve scared the hell out of me i m not saying i hated this it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children it lost some effect for me i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on and it would ve been a creepier experience horror movie fans should like this even though i personally thought it would be better the atmosphere is very very creepy and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way but it just didn t do it for me rent it first,negative

the most simple definition of is sexual gratuitousness sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on not providing anything pertinent to the plot you can t help but get a porno feel while watching bully and to think i was supposed to be viewing a film about teenage revenge on the local bully but it turns out to be a soft porn version of how vapid teenagers waste away their lives with a little killing thrown in was it really necessary to show a shot of a girl s crotch while she s driving a car was it necessary to have a sex scene or nudity scene or drug scene every 3 minutes you can t help but see the director as a pervert who is more preoccupied with sex and street cred grittiness than telling a good story the very first scene is of a guy having phone sex several things about this movie other than the made me mad 1 you re planning to kill somebody then proceed to tell everybody including the waitress at pizza hut what you re planning 2 after you kill you re so afraid of being caught that you proceed to put more suspicion on yourself by acting very strange and telling even more people what you did 3 which makes more sense to decide to kill a guy because he disrespects you and beats you up occasionally and has sex with your girlfriend or to stop hanging out with him completely and stop lending your girlfriend out like a wh ore bobby never put a gun to the guy s head to make him hang out with him yet murder was the only option 4 i can t believe mr wimp who never fights back can all of a sudden muster the strength to slit a guy s throat while he s staring him blankly in the face begging for his life 5 all of the characters,negative
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those aren t basinger s legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd s characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that s no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he doesn t have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step mother is not like other people basinger s character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think jar jar blinks i suppose it s ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that s it flat and mechanical,negative

oh how i will never forget seeing the re release of this film it was in 1974 and i could not keep my eye s from it it is now 2006 and i still can t what this movie is to me is a place in my heart and being a avid collector of films from the silents to the classics and obscure i find that very meaningful if you have not seen 7th you are missing out it truly is a funtastic film i put this above jason and the argonauts for my reason alone \( i know i stand alone in this for jason has more monsters and the great ray harryhausen has said jason is his fav along with many of his fans \) what 7th has above jason for me is music a soundtrack to a film has always been a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has that extra push on jason bernard herrman s score is so dreamlike you can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is trancelike especially the snake woman dance please anyone who reads this have 7th voyage in your collection \( jason the argonauts too for that matter \) you wont be dissapointed i will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screen and never forget it i hope when you watch ray harryhausen s children and bernard herrman s music come to life you too will not forget it some say gone with the wind wizard of oz casablanca citizen kane jaws star wars \( 77 \) superman \( 78 \) e t titanic 2001 a space pulp fiction not me if i was on a island and could only have one film from my library \( ouch i have alot of films and alot i love \) but i would have to pick the seventh voyage that would be the one for me on the island and please let it be the isle of colossus,positive
this is possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen the writing and acting as far as i am concerned are no better than that of a middle school live performance the only reason i didn t turn it off was that i was hoping something in the movie might help me justify spending 10 to buy it used that something never came i would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment such as schindler s list the pianist trust me pass it up just as fast as you can,negative

the ab portion of the dvd is good although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set the last one is a step type exercise so if you don t have something you can step up on you can t do it the dvd itself is not very professionally done tamilee miscounts doesn t look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words abs of steel maybe buns of steel no way,negative
the folks at pbs deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th century america this documentary covers sometimes comprehensively sometimes briefly virtually every important topic germane to the field of study from pictorialism to straight photography from fashion to the scientific along the way we are introduced \( or reintroduced \) to what has been the medium s most important uses journalism and documentary a century of images is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane concern over the ethical issues photographs present and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post industrial age on the psyche of our nation these themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving one memorable example the way edward curtis s images of native americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they really were sections on war photography cover wwi wwii vietnam and the gulf war with compassion and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in iraq another bonus the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness until i was able to buy this fabulous history on dvd my biggest complaint was that while using the vhs version i had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes i wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where i teach now that i can happily locate scenes at will using the dvd menu i can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings more on walker evans robert frank diane arbus please they were pretty damned influential,positive

the beautiful young brooke shields plays 11 12 year old violet daughter of hattie \( susan sarandon \) a new orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917 violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world when she turns 12 her virginity is auctioned off brooke shields portrayal of violet is poignant and beautiful her childish charms and innocence are so heart wrenchingly sweet the scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer s bed \( very childlike \) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose forehead etc and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings i just wanted to jump into the tv and give her a hug this mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene \( and others \) is particularly poignant as we know that young violet is merely reciting what she s heard from the prostitutes the photographer also says that violet doesn t know what she s saying you just want to turn the clock back hug violet and give her a proper childhood the photographer marries her because he s fascinated with her beauty innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute the part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he s trying to give back her childhood sadly she s been exposed to too much too soon in her life susan sarandon and brooke shields are wonderful in this movie as well as keith carradine the photographer the art aspect music soundtrack are amazing this movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as normal which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to rescue young violet,positive

this workout is nice because it doesn t mess around there are no long introductions you can t fast forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series \( which is all legs and hips \) are really challenging and i plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery one complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren t available very widespread in retail stores i also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout all in all though great,positive
let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language,negative

there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film but as a whole it just didn t quite work for me vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character fanda a maddening yet adorable grandpa oh so young at heart oh so mischievious and impish but somehow oh so good hearted and harmless that you can t help loving him warts and all in fact that s one of the fatal flaws of this movie the lack of any dark side to any of the characters they re all basically harmless walt disney types even the bumbling and self absorbed son there are no real consequences to brodsky s actions other than stella \( his wife \) finally talking divorce but it s obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she ll come back to him there is no center no force or dynamic power in this film it s like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don t want to hurt the feelings of your host the ending also relies on another lazy device the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice supporter of fanda s when she sees that his attempt at self reform is only making him miserable this film might ve been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda s desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death instead of focusing on how clever audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse narcissism one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr brodsky who is a towering figure among czech actors that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him a more accurate title for this movie especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll might be the fantasy life of a poor old man,negative
this 1971 offering stars giancarlo giannini in a fine performance as a police inspector on the hunt for a psycho who stuns his attractive victime with a poison dipped needle before eviscerating them the production is above average slick and the performances are fine especially from giannini but i just didn t find it involving suspenseful or stylish enough to keep my finger off fast forward it s not bad just average the climax and the killer s unmasking is particularly weak and anti climactic fans of the genre seem to really like this one but i suggest a rental before a purchase,negative
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here \( crash comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world \) my beefs are not the same as most of those who don t like the film i don t much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it isn t depressing at all cause i didn t care it s just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here s a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i don t like any of these people so their pain doesn t mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would ve worked but now there just isn t anything there as far as what s actually in the movie we ve got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we ve got jared s mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto s friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there s no real attempt to make wayans into a person he s got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that s it the doubly sad fact is that he s the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it s a wonder that the smack doesn t cause them to cease to exist entirely \( well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually like the bergman films i ve seen so that s not really a fair comparison \) they love each other apparently but since i don t even like either of them i m not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it wouldn t have been funny if i cared about her but we ve been over that and i want you people to know that i m not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie s dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting which has drug addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba ho tep a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that s all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream isn t helped any by darren aronofsky s repetitive derivative over direction the trouble is this movie hasn t got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there s nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they re hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see fast motion a thousand times quick cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera attached to the actor junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain t drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that doesn t make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky wasn t going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters weren t going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that s a good ending grade d ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows,negative
i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies though i think the lost world is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies monster movies or horror movies should own all three i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two you will definitely like the third movie,positive
i m sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target to imply that christians are typically mean and narrow minded is pure racism this is just as evil as implying that all jews are rich or that all african americans have rhythem what has jesus himself done to warrant such christian bashing out of hollywood the man has suffered enough on the cross leave him alone,negative
alyssa milano s mother \( who is also her manager \) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet she s denounced such websites exploitation on national tv and has even developed a side business as a cybercop lending her web busting skills to other stars milano s mother manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film embrace of the vampire is softcore horror porn and the source for many of those milano skin pics after tv s who s the boss was canceled \( but before charmed returned milano to star status \) milano was just another unemployed former child actress so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody two shoes girl she d played in who s the boss in other words she wanted to grow as an actress so she did embrace of the vampire in which she goes topless in several scenes engages in a lesbian romp with charlotte lewis and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body mission accomplished actually embrace of the vampire uses milano s virginal image from who s the boss by casting her as a virgin a virgin whose boobs are straining against her too tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend \( albeit asking him not to look \) but still a virgin a virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn t know why here s why milano is the reincarnation of martin kemp s true love some 300 years ago a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy now that he s rediscovered milano he has three nights to rekindle her love for him if so they will live forever as vampires if not he dies and loses her forever why the sudden three night deadline why not the plot and motivations are paper thin as is typical of porn milano wanders around campus wondering why she s having so many sexual dreams even daydreams her boyfriend wanders about wondering if she s so pure kemp wanders about seen by milano but often not by others lewis wanders about for some bisexual action other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action amid all this wandering there s much carnal action and more carnal dreaming occasionally kemp kills someone for dissing milano john stanley \( in his creature features movie guide \) correctly refers to it as a meandering almost formless script kemp has the best lines like many vampires he agonizes and suffers a hyper romantic vampire angst over a lost love his appearance is a touch effeminate \( too much eyeliner \) but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character he is part romantic vampire part bloodthirsty beast lewis s small part is pointless to the story all that s required is that she undress and when she does it was worth the wait rachel true \( the craft \) has an even smaller role the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on all of the above three are more interesting more charismatic than milano or her boyfriend at film s end kemp s tearful bloodthirsty angst and milano s tearful rediscovery of her love the tragic star crossed ending and the christian iconography all mirror coppola s bram stoker s dracula \( 1992 \) one senses that director goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material however this is no poor woman s bram stoker s dracula milano is no winona ryder and kemp is no gary oldman for that matter none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts and the budget just isn t there the strength of low budget horror is a gritty authenticity which this film tries to hide rather than utilize how low was the budget listen i was an extra on both bram stoker s dracula and embrace of the vampire \( in both instances i kept my clothes on \) i worked one day on embrace of the vampire don t look for me i ended up on the cutting room floor and extras are rarely mentioned in credits but let me tell you an inside story on the making of this film we were shooting in a nightclub on the sunset strip the extras were divided into three camps union nonunion and modesto extras union extras earn the most especially once overtime kicks in so they were wrapped after eight hours \( they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota \) this was during my nonunion days \( i m in sag now \) so i put in a full 14 hours after which we were paid in cash and wrapped the modesto extras were still working when we left now what you may ask is a modesto extra i also wondered and so i asked one i was told they were from an acting class in modesto california they had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a class assignment in other words they were paying to come to work there s not a whole lot to learn about being an extra it s neither glamourous nor difficult and nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are very easy to come by the lampposts in los angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle ehr extras i did it for the cash and because if you do it often enough you increase your chances of getting into the union \( which i did after some 13 grueling months \) never pay for the chance to be an extra not in los angeles i made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times but wised up after a few months my guess is the producers of embrace of the vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle and far less than even nonunion extras cost i know this teacher was getting paid by the students and that they were not getting paid to be on the film another inside story someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member she was near tears because it had sentimental value never leave anything of value lying around on a set and some trivia john stanley says this film was originally conceived as the nosferatu diaries but on the set we were told the working title was the collector embrace of the vampire is a decent time killer barely if you re looking for horror there are hundreds of better films dozens of better vampire films even many superior erotic vampire films vampyres \( british 1975 \) comes to mind but if you re looking for milano nudies this is the film to see,negative
i found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that i had to quit watching this after about 20 of the video the movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise \( about a 4 \) the sound of the singing was very grating harsh to my ears since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible it also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content the photography art direction were exquisite,negative
just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the dvd it s fullscreen and doesn t have any special features now if you ve seen the scenes that weren t included in the extended vhs but were for some reason on the cable version you d see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie i d really like to see this one get maybe a double dvd release with when nature calls souped up and some of those great missing scenes including ace singing onstage with cannibal corpse \( funniest scene in the whole movie i thought \) ace conversing with a few drunks in ray finkle s hometown and some others,negative

the petrified forest is a filmed version of the 1935 broadway smash the play starred leslie howard and humphrey bogart and their stage performances were preserved when warner brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935 the addition of bette davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with howard after their earlier matching in of human bondage the film is set in the arizona desert a killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there the play has a few things to say about the meaning of life with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual alan squier played by leslie howard and vicious gangster duke mantee played by humphrey bogart the morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of leslie howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance the film was a breakthrough for bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career she is also very well photographed by sol polito and her big eyes glow the dvd print is excellent and a lot of extras are included including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film a terrible vitaphone short with the absurd toby wing and a funny cartoon about the cocoanut grove the radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor tyrone power in howard s role the dvd is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the warners gangster collection,positive

modigliani \( 2004 \) is a self indulgent pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist writer director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work ironically the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani despite his boundless enthusiasm andy garcia is simply too old for the title role an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight to video fate,negative
i really wanted to give superman volume 3 a full 5 stars but unfortunately the quality control of the dvd release is poor hence the 1 star rating the dvd set i purchased skipped at the green lantern episode the replacement i got also skipped at the same place in addition the two sided disc format with which all three dvd volumes have been released is a damage prone format luckily i was able to get a full refund but at this point i m not sure if or when i ll try my chance at buying this set again the lack of quality control is too bad because volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series if you are fortunate enough to get a dvd set free of defects then you are really in for a treat bruce timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to superman as they did on batman the animated series of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain darkseid throughout the series it finally gets put front and center in several episodes of volume 3 and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale i felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series,negative

unlike many of the reviewers here i m not a biblical expert and really don t care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible i would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally the biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out there were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story \( and in some cases detracted from it \) for instance during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water everyone goes a bit crazy that s an acceptable premise but it s played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors the idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn t have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play there were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water \( between lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water \) which undermined the entire story of the great flood everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats it was just plain silly and again seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary spice \( it didn t work as a means of jazzing up the story \) i m guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals this type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad to the movie s credit the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn t work,negative
i rarely write reviews but quoting ebert \( who inexplicably liked this \) i hated this movie 1 is editor the correct term to apply to joe klotz i give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4 if you want to see a good slow paced movie watch l aaventura for a much better recent indie film about family life buy the squid and the wale 2 if the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well amy adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb but sweet southerner \( see forrest gump waterboy \) i guess her performance reaffirmed what hollywood thinks of the south notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from california or ny does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs 3 i assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism i feel bad for the masochists but not the pretentious pseudo intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit 4 rent this first and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not 19 9,negative

i don t know how this skunk got 4 and 1 2 stars on amazon let alone one i could hear hepburn bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom i think this is mainly because of ford s linus he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake the film critics said that while the original sabrina was about her transformation this version was about linus transformation but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end there was a merger and you were in the way no hard feelings is very cold compared with bogart s would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it in the original you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man you don t get that here at all,negative
hallmark entertainment has made many movies from children s books and this probably one of the worst based on both alice in wonderland and through the looking glass this movie stars many of the familiar faces of hallmark movies and children s movies such as gene wilder miranda richardson martin short and whoopi goldberg the lead character of alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good the movie revolves around her and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression even the crying scenes seemed fake where is dakota fanning when you need her the cinematography costume and set design are spot on as usual for hallmark movies but the soundtrack was unnoticeable the only bright spot was the engaging song by gene wilder s character all in all quite boring,negative
when this movie starts it is so dark you can t even see anything the only way you can know what is going on it to read what amazon tells you after that it is just stupid,negative
i had never watched this film before ordering it so i took the chance it turned out to be a smart buy as usual peck is just awesome he seems to fit this role well as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man as the movie continues you realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level i enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film overall this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer so if you are considering purchasing this dvd i d suggest you buy it you ll enjoy it,positive
four stars seem a little generous the film is certainly memorable and certainly different there are a lot of odd things going on here the oddest is why the central character mark lewis is so obviously a blond blue eyed german very strange this is there some weird subterranean comment about the sickness of hitler s germany and how we ought to feel sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes because of their blighted childhoods much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy handed however as other reviewers have pointed out it is consistently perverse the director of the film within the film the walls are closing in is played by an actor who was in point of fact virtually blind he had a bit part in several james bond films is there some message here peeping tom s father the heartless psychologist was played by powell himself what is this telling us is part of the message meant to be that the camera kills it doesn t hang together somehow what s the meaning of the model with half a hideous face why is the would be girl friend s alcoholic mother blind why is the only presence with real star quality moira shearer playing a stand in much of the premise of the film seems promising but it is clumsily written and directed with a leaden hand in fact what many of the powell pressburger films seem to lack is any real sense of pace or excitement it s all a bit tired and slow there is nausea but no shock or thrill loco perhaps but psycho it isn t,positive

this woman may have a great body but she cannot teach dancing for anything in the 35 minute cardio dance portion dance steps are taught frustratingly fast \( and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing \) it took so long to figure out the steps which are not your typical exercise or step class steps that i shut the dvd off and jumped on the treadmill the two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better but you really need to do them both back to back to feel any benefits i would say this is a good video for anybody thats got lots of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the dvd because you ll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she s doing save your money,negative

imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing then you would have battlefield earth it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project just awful if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed,negative

american gigolo stars richard gere of a high priced male prostitute he is coasting along with his rich southern cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered when he is considered the main suspect he goes on the run with his only friend being the wife of a politician at the begining he tells people that he is a moral man for example he dosn t service gays more on that in a moment it is interseting to note that gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in pretty woman and it made a star out of julia roberts but that is where the similarities end this is a much darker story about hypocracy when he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him in the end he finds himself a hypocrit because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job gays s and m anything to avoid jail the only love story here is about him and the politician s wife \( lauren hutten \) it is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him even for his own protection for all it s darkness there is one funny scene richard gere is called in for a line up at the police department he tells the other men in the line up that he got paid and the others get angry and cause a scene averting the attention off of gere this is a really good movie as an examination of society s attitude toward sex this film was written and directed by paul schrader if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to taxi driver richard gere is wooden but his character is cold and icy so that approach is right lauren hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man she seems sincere in wanting to help gere but i thought the standout performance was bill duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing \( as oppose to gere s madam \) but also provides the warning to gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out and another future pretty woman player is present hector elanzo he plays the detective on gere s trail but he is slimy and rather unlikable here well worth your time but for adults only,positive
this is a great movie especially if you like dancehall queen paul campbell does a great job as capone and carl bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss while the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching,positive
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies,negative
2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn t require you to have seen the original i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out and having never seen the original i thought i would be lost and wouldn t enjoy myself as much as other people but on the contrary i left the experience much happier than when i came in this film is full of quick one liners that deserve a laugh the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open i have heard and read that people didn t appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races but overall i think the balance works well even thinking of the plot that we are left with i really can t see another time when a race would even be appropriate and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original i would have to disagree why frankly i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor \( i mean c mon have you seen the pacifier \) he s nothing more than a meat head who while able to do pretty good fight scenes should leave the dialogue to someone else yes this film is for the younger crowd and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place \( take the boat jumping as an example \) but there is no saying that an older person wouldn t enjoy it as well the only thing that i will say is that you really shouldn t go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance or else you will be disappointed if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is however you will thoroughly enjoy yourself,positive
terrible follow up to the first movie this movie does not hold a candle to the first classic movie staring john travolta and olivia newton john the acting is bad and it is not worth the money it belongs where most grease belongs in a bucket under the sink,negative
i saw transamerica months ago and i still think about it there are many reasons most obviously felicity huffman s portrayal of bree a man determined to become a woman trying to close the door on his past just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child but transamerica also brings a funny poignant and at times visually beautiful road trip across the united states in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles let alone 3000 it brings unexpected and uncertain romance it brings out humanity in all its characters \( save one minor one \) including bree s bitter mother finally it plot spoiler here concludes with tentative reconciliation acceptance and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future transamerica is not loud not big budget not spectacular but there are few movies near as good as it,positive
i was greatly disappointed in this dvd here s why 1 it s basically 60 minutes of warming up 2 the level 3 \( advanced \) is not that hard 3 the annoying inhale exhale chant really makes it difficult to find my center i just wanted to tell her shut up 4 i didn t break a sweat once 5 i used it twice and never plan to use it again i mean c mon i don t want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won t get me results i must say the only thing positive about this dvd is the landscape in short rent this from blockbuster or buy it used don t waste any more than 5 bucks on this it s not worth it,negative

i was very disappointed with this second edition my daughter and i loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting the movie dragged out for the first half and just got worse during the second half i continually kept looking at the clock wondering when it would be over we only watched it once and it will go in the rummage sale later this year,negative
i watched this film at the suggestions of a friend had to watch it again the very next night and have seen it several times since it s so nice to watch a film where people are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive language or elicit scenes just recently learned of some friends in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to help work throught the emotions they are having livvy a young and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the death of her mother the father of her baby leaves the scene and livvy s father insists that she will not have a child out of wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very rural area of colrado ray \( the farmer \) is shy and reserved but was brought up with high moral values and treats livvy like she is something special the rest of the movie develops the story of how ray and livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love even though that was not livvy s original intention i think the film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance i have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends i highly recommend it,positive
this movie is a disaster there is not one single memorable performance by the cast of stars if you want to see a little boy happily running to school get hit by a car walk home injured and die have at it there is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by amazon criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it they should be is ashame,negative
sometimes i wonder how it is we don t live in a vigilante society people do such awful things and alot of times the system really can t don t do anything for the victims well in this film this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son s killer would be dealt with story takes place in a small town where the strout family is a big deal you know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers there is also the fowler family which also make their way in the town she is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son frank that is dating an older woman \( marisa tomei \) and she has 2 sons well the strout family s son is married to marisa tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they aren t even divorced yet can t say that i blame him there but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly moving along the strout s son kills frank and because of the strout s clout and the fact that the ex wife didn t actually see him fire the shot he is going to get off with manslaughter this does not sit well with the fowler s the fowler s have a friend that has over 300 acres of land so you can only imagine what happens i certainly don t condone vigilantism however i just loved the ending the strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail so since it appeared that he jumped bail they will lose all of that beautiful then they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets i couldn t help but get some satisfaction out of that myself very real and very interesting great movie,positive
the series just keeps on getting better the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television the other funny show was newhart which i cannot understand why it has not been released on dvd the whole cast just clicks i wish shows like this were still on television if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets,positive

i thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in detroit all the time time i was learning every new motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits i had no knowledge of the funk brothers i grew up on detroit s north end and a lot of the motown stars came from this area i connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow covered english tudor homes on detroit s northwest side the film has wonderful themes fame success heartbreak the beauty of friendship among musicians failure to be recognized recognition much too late and attempts of redemption if not apology i think the whole city of detroit or at least my part of it was heartbroken with the news that motown was moving to los angeles in the film the musicians are given their due a la their cubano brothers and sisters in buena vista social club,positive

i turned the movie off was that supposed to be funny yes some kids toy \( that happens to be a small motorized electric model of a truck \) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village i mean was this taken from the original stephen king book then shame on you mr king that s overdoing the terror already so overdone not that the consept of trucks didn t appeal to me but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so called horrormaster so far believe it or not,negative
this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it unfortunately i was wrong the main problem of the film was characterization there were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character s actions one minute the small town girl played by heather graham is working at a nursing home then she s downing alcohol then she s jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason \( in fact she doesn t even seem drunk \) and all this entices the character colin firth to jump into bed with her i think the heather graham character is supposed to be quirky but because of the script and the way the film is cut she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance \( and this is no rebound relationship \) basically the movie continues along this vein with minnie driver showing up as the dark haired british ex fiance who you can t see ever having had a relationship with colin \( both actors are better in the much superior movie circle of friends \) in any case there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends additionally the setting is completely misused beginning with the sign that says more than 18 000 people live in hope in new england that does not classify as a small town they could have used the autumn setting and american ness of the people as restorative to the colin character the suggestion of that is there but it is never demonstrated instead they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the heather graham character downs a bottle of booze and colin firth s character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town s people although the hotel owners are fun if unrealistic the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character finally i don t neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie with the wierd cutting it may have seemed like a good idea at the time i think colin firth does his best at being an ambigious but still likeable guy heather graham aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all has absolutely nothing to work with so you can t even blame her for the horrendous character she has and everyone else including minnie driver is a complete caricature although minnie driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film i feel bad to judge this movie so harshly but it is unneccessarily bad and i had been hoping for something at least fun these actors all have much better movies out there,negative

fast times at ridgemont high is a clever insightful and wicked film it is not just another teen movie though to the casual observer it might be no it is a time capsule into the socal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films of the late 70 s and 80 s as well as it is a time capsule into the mindset of teenagers all over the u s circa 1982 sean penn \( whom i m not a big fan of \) as jeff spicoli is truly inspired i find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer takes what an awesome character when he says you d ck to ray walston s mr hand \( another inspired and forever memorable character \) you just wanna roll on the floor jennifer jason leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl struggling with sexuality phoebe cates as the girl who believes herself to be in the only truly mature relationship anyone has \( with a college boy \) is fresh and believable judge reinhold as leigh s older brother is inspired mike damone is a sleaze and a great character \( if only he really believed in himself as much as he wants others to \) in fact this film boasts huge numbers of young actors who went on to become stars the script by a very young cameron crowe is brilliant fast times came out at roughly the same time as the last american virgin and several years after rock and roll high school neither of those other films is anywhere on par with fast times at times light and airy fast times carries a serious message that teen agers are truly finding their way in life in the best way they know how it is somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any of the kids in the film the adults we see are those with whom they interact with outside the home truly teenagers feel that their young lives are more affected by people other than their parents while last american virgin approached some of the same topics that fast times does it did it in a more sinister way fast times doesn t gloss over teen age problems but puts them in perspective of how the teenager his herself deals with them yes it s a comedy and yes it is funny but it is not just a film for kids,positive
yup definately the worst halloween movie come on michael on a reality show ha what the f k does that have to do with the series not only that but the plot is completely pointless the acting sucks and dr loomis and jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie not only that but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary and therefore comes off as pretentious don t get me wrong i love gore in movies horror or not but any knowledgable halloween fan knows that the halloween movies were always scary without the gore along with halloween 3 \( which actually had nothing to do with michael \) halloween resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series there are a many more problems with the movie than the ones i listed but i m tired of typing so i ll let other reviewers explain why it s so bad bottom line watch any halloween movie other than this or halloween 3,negative

great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost didn t finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira s voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie,negative

i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs and you re infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again they come up with this idiotic scheme which ended up in disaster \( both the hilton and auto world closed within a year \) moore in recent years has become a political celebrity in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it s not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them aren t really interested in changing anything as it might interfere with their livelihoods i don t know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent darkly funny film about real class warfare and the dismantling of the working class in america,positive

i wish i could give this movie zero stars it s really amazing how someone can inject raw gore violence and sick humour into a movie and try to pass it off as slick comedy drama and deep philosophy this movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie the sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism do yourself a favour and please don t ever watch this movie if it comes on air it s not even worth watching for morbid fascination i terribly resent the fact that i gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity but then i may actually be glad that i did at least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be,negative
plot summary a man without a memory found floating in the mediterranean sea searches for his identity discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly trained government assassin reason for the rating violence and some language based on the robert ludlum authored book by the same name the bourne identity is part action flick part stylized thriller in his first role as an erstwhile action hero matt damon shines as bourne imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable in his own skin even though he doesn t know who he is ease as the story opens bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat the hey this is a story about espionage theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number upon finding and opening the safe deposit box bourne discovers multiple passports \( including one with the name jason bourne \) a variety of foreign currency and a gun he then begins his search to uncover his true identity and until now so does the audience if there is one misstep in the bourne identity it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency s frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne s identity far earlier than bourne himself at this point the film becomes more of a how will he survive thriller rather than a who am i mystery a love interest of sorts \( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente \) gives bourne a partner in crime to play off of for much of the movie but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development an implied \( off screen \) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief but doesn t detract too much from the action the most interesting \( and morally significant \) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on through this pivotal flashback \( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense \) we learn that the highly trained killing machine isn t capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target s children in the room with him bourne s hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film s premise as he is shot falling into the mediterranean sea smartly directed the bourne identity is fast paced without feeling rushed the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows giving the movie a unique noir like look that fits well with the drama as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities this film is a winner for older teens and adults nappaland com recommends ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride the bourne identity is a worthy discovery after the show if members of your family choose to view this movie use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht what does this say about bourne s moral compass how would you feel if you suddenly couldn t remember who you were what actions would you take to discover your identity when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew when have you felt that way how can a relationship with jesus give us a second chance in the truest sense s,positive
this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks,negative
aside from the insanely beautiful lead actress this is pretty run of the mill stuff not scary only sort of gross but i think it d be best in print clive barker deserved better than this,negative
it s an interesting approach at what people will do for money still i hated it john travolta was terrible as usual lisa kudrow who was the reason i watched this was so incredibly unlike her role on friends as she was a murderous goldigging nympho biatch who made you mad every time she was on screen i was very disappointed with her performance i can t believe this hilarious comedic actress went for such a part the other supporting actors were no good either with the exception of bill pullman who was pretty funny as the i could give a damn about it cop the best thing about this movie though is the cute gullible waitress named wendy who s only on screen about five minutes throughout the entire film anyway skip this one it was just plain awful,negative

the first time i put this workout dvd on i expected to see exercises designed for abs buns and thighs what i actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing dvd i kept going thinking it would get to the abs buns and thighs but it never did the other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up or headshots only so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine you can t even learn it because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming picking up on a different beat to where it left off all in all an awful purchase and not even worth the 4 86 paid i turned it off halfway through the second workout and put billy blanks taebo on instead much better,negative
this video s only redeeming quality is its excellent pilates instruction like all stott videos this one takes extra care to explain proper form and technique unfortunately the aerobics portion is extremely boring and simple you just walk in place the whole time with no interesting variations if you are looking for a video for a beginner this one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are really out of shape although i consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercise this video was too easy for me i haven t exercised consistently in several years however i do have a moderately active lifestyle i walk and hike on occassion and i play with my kids at the park that sort of thing if you have trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape this would be a great place to start if you are somewhat fit this video might be too easy for you as well you might also like this video if you feel like you have no coordination there are no fancy moves at all if you can walk you can do this video i like simple steps but this was too simple in general though i think you d be better off saving your money and taking a walk spend your money on one of the other excellent stott videos that focuses exclusively on pilates,negative
the funny thing about this movie is that i read negative reviews here and rather agree with what they assert that the plots and some of the characters are not very evolved due to time if you disect the movie yes this is true nonetheless i love this movie i love watching the what the actors do with this material and how they manage with so little time to invest the viewer in their story emma thompson gives a perfect performance i think highlighting how complicated long marriages can become and the pitfalls of being too functional bill nighy is hilarious acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments quite refreshing most of all it is genuinely funny life can feel \( or at least my life can feel \) disjointed and i love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections,positive
damn there s nothing remarkable about the second item on this dvd it s your standard european made sexploitation film the wild wild world of jayne mansfield on the other hand is reprehensible it s a hodge podge of vacation footage of mansfield clips from her movie project and material entirely unrelated to mansfield linked only by the voiceover and then after an hour or so of light hearted softcore buffoonery the movie cuts to her death spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large mostly empty mansion she has left behind this movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after mansfield s death this is exploitation in its worst form i found the sudden change in tone the large volume of non mansfield material and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy or softcore porn to tittilate go elsewhere this one is not merely bad but evil,negative
this film had a powerful effect on me 95 of the people i know don t read books i met a millionaire not long ago who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life lady di was reported never to have read anything except perhaps fashion mags my children hardly read and their husbands and wives certainly don t my ex wife never read anything her father thought ulysses was a dirty book i stopped watching television in 1980 and i own 10 000 books but not fahrenheit 451 which i d read about 45 years ago this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury s text but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear and with a very solid punch to the plexus the manner in which it is written played and directed added to its impact this world of sleep walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us the style was strange but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal people live and work like automated morons they can t think for themselves and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied they can t conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind in fact present them with an idea or attempt to initiate a discussion and they ll often become angry some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts ludicrous suggestions remake it with mad mel gibson have infantile spielberg direct it bulk it out with computerised sfx these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub humans which the film targets and many of them seem unable to understand their own language let alone write it or spell it this is a memorable film for those whose memories still function unlike the captain of the firemen,positive
if i m not mistaken the only difference between the standard 50th anniversary edition and the ultimate collector s edition is 1 \) collectible robby the robot replica 2 \) forbidden planet and the invisible boy reproduction lobby cards portfolio 3 \) forbidden planet original theatrical poster mail in offer 4 \) metal alloy collector s case in that case the ultimate collector s edition at more than twice the price of the standard edition is a rip off the robby the robot replica is much smaller and much less detailed than the one depicted in the ad the mail in offer for the free poster requires a 3 50 shipping and handling fee the metal alloy collectors case is made of very thin metal and arrived dented not that it would take much to dent it save 21 00 and buy the standard version,negative
this movie has a good plot great acting and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life i did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos the profanity the undermining of parental authority and the lack of closure concerning landon s journey to faith it is evedent that this movie is directed to a less than mature audience i saw more bad in it than good which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie,negative
i purchased dick cavett s john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material i gained new insight about john and yoko so i bought cavett s interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar the 15 minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best,negative

i have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the mask is no exception i would also have to say that the mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films there are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but i think the one thing that shines the most about the mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it for those of you who don t know a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old tex avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress \( this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd \) these kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes getting back on the subject what i also found thrilling about the mask is how well the dog milo was trained to perform certain task if you have seen this movie you know what i m talking about the training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd the movie itself was a take off of the comic series of the mask though not quite as dark as the comics the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi violence so that the mask would not be deemed as a children s film hence the pg 13 rating a big plus to the mask was how jim carrey portrayed the different character traits of stanley ipkis and stanley ipkis wearing the mask another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask and of course who can dislike ben stein s typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks oh and cameron diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well as for the dvd this re release is an improvement from the previous you get 5 1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture the added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie,positive
musicals are historically slight in the plot department and this movie is no exception three stars one fading one rising and one coasting do not help matters either rita is the fading star it was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow the make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes and her hair and costumes are just bad novak is the rising star although i don t get the 50 s obsession with bubble headed busty bleach blond bimbos it would help if she could act but sadly her range is very limited i truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic since she was unable to convey it herself then there is frank just coasting on his charm and cool doesn t seem plausible that a hep cat like him who could bag any doll dame or mouse would fall for either of these gals anyway i gave it 2 stars because of snuffy the dog he stole every scene he was in although that wasn t too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie,negative
i will be honest i like dolph lundgren a look at his filmography you see b movie classics such as the punisher universal soldier and blackjack dolph has been going trough a slump storm catcher and the startlingly routine jill the ripper and the awful minion \( aka fallen knight \) but with agent red dolph lundgren hits rock bottom agent red first of all steals it s music from predator 2 and it s plot from counter measures oh i m not finished yet it steals footage from storm catcher the scene where jon penner steals the air craft while posing as dolph lundgren now penner is 5 11 dolph lundgren is 6 5 for goodness sake yet they try to pass it off as dolph lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission this scene made me wanna throw up but i hung in there it turns out more footage is stolen i swear i saw footage from iron eagle and iron eagle ii i saw footage from crimson tide and i saw footage from counter measures what the heck was dolph thinking when he signed for this junk i have no idea when i was a teen \( when showdown in little tokyo came out \) i thought dolph lundgren couldn t sink lower then showdown in little tokyo then when i saw the minion i was almost sure dolph couldn t do worse well i pray he can t do any worse because agent red is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life this is coming from a guy who likes don the dragon wilson bottomline on agent red s cover it says once exposed you cannot survive take this as a warning,negative
i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents considering that it was aimed at children it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance while no stripping happened there wasn t much other difference in the style of dance later in the movie one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn t have her and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire regardless of the rest of the movie these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one,negative
this is without a doubt one of harrison fords greatest moments an incredible film with some of the best visual effects i ve ever seen very dramatic with a lot of suspense a very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view a film you will want to see again and again action mystery drama thriller there are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such but they don t in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama i highly recommend it,positive

barbershop is a rare event in african american filmmaking it s one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for african americans i love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the african american community is we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen i really liked this movie we definitely need more films like this calvin is the owner of a chicago barbershop passed on to him by his late father mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life it s not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood there are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they re all easy to follow one follows a stolen atm machine one follows the quest for love of an african immigrant another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview and yet another follows a white barber s quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with in a way this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like pulp fiction that follow many characters and their stories each of the stories lead up to the ending where calvin saves the barbershop director tim story does a great job of capturing life in chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop i felt the spirit of the windy city and the informal environment of the barbershop watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in harlem my father used to take me to when i was a boy it also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop i used to go to get my flat top trimmed \( both are closed now \) \( there are a ton of great performances in this movie i m probably going to miss mentioning a few people ice cube is great as calvin i liked his performance here michael ealy stands out in his role as an ex con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber ealy makes you feel his characters desperation cedric the entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber he s funny and poignant sean nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college anthony anderson and larenz tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an atm with no money in it watching them try to open will make you laugh keith david is creepy as the loan shark then again keith david is always good in anything he does i d pay money to watch him and sam jackson read listings in the yellow pages i don t know why movie critics and the rev jesse jackson denounced barbershop it s one of the best movies ever made about african american life looking at the box office of barbershop and diary of a mad black woman african americans actually want more films like this as a black moviegoer i want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community not just one small part of it i for one and tired of the hood movies like never die alone and critically acclaimed movies like monster s ball and hustle flow that depict black life as something negative \( thankfully it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too the box office and dvd sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like barbershop and diary of a mad black woman are going up \) end of rant back to the review a shawn james essential five star video you must buy this movie get some friends together put the dvd in the machine pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the tv and hang out at the barbershop,positive
i covered a similar theme in my international relations ma whilst any programme made for tv has to be reasonable breif on the subject i found this to be a very well argued and produced programme i recomend it not so much as some dark conspiracy but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country we should question to make sure that what happens in our name is always in our interest,positive
this dvd is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show for a best of volume i expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the dvd case advertises namely the best of and the scariest moments in my opinion this volume fails to deliver what it promises i am definitely a fan of the series and i know there are much better moments it has to offer about the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this dvd are some fairly decent examples of evp \( electronic voice phenomenon \) even though the dvd is fairly inexpensive i don t think it s worth the cost,negative

i was intrigued by satan s little helper due to several things namely its halloween theme which i m a big sucker for and the heralded return of jeff lieberman to the horror scene lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70 s and 80 s the last one being 1987 s remote control you would think that lieberman with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return well it almost feels like lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80 s due to how cheesy trashy cheap and godawful it is many myself included look upon the 80 s slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be the plot revolves around a 10 year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game satan s little helper it s now halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume which he wears proudly one afternoon he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house he becomes enamored with the tall mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper the two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy \( whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5 year old than a 10 year old \) inexplicably thinks it s all still a game of make believe if you think the plot sounds bad that s nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed nearly everything about it is god awful from the camcorder film quality to the laughable gore effects \( including the least ever convincing intestines i ve ever seen \) and especially the acting the 10 year old boy who appears in nearly every scene makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory the acting on just about everyone s part is bad and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason the flaky sister and the eccentric kooky mother there is not a single character we can give a darn about and we don t care the least bit when someone gets killed granted dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen but these ones truly take the cake i m a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews i m thinking some people are going to put this in the so good it s bad category but i m not having it some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be funny such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman an elderly lady and a stroller carrying a kid are downright appalling the villain himself is a bad joke as he doesn t utter a single word throughout the film instead delivering thumbs up signs to the kid and wagging his finger cheesy heck this film is cheesier than a black diamond factory satan s little helper comes across as the work of a first time wannabe horror amateur with no budget not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker to sum up how i feel about this film i will repeat a line that i see all over amazon that i usually feel redundant but somehow i find to be entirely fitting for this movie do not rent or buy this garbage,negative

shekhar kapur s vision of a e w mason s the four feathers is well done visually but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast paced and action packed plot while the basic story is kept many small details seem to have been needlessly changed for those who don t know the four feathers is supposedly about harry feversham a man enlisted in the army when harry is informed he will be sent to war in the sudan he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fianc ethne however life with ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues explaining to ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help harry in fact she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of ethne for the most part only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie for example the way that harry s friend jack durrance goes blind or the fact that harry disguised himself as a greek not as an arab the change that seems most prominent however is the fact that in the film jack durrance knows of harry s resignation from the beginning this subverts the whole quest that jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel in addition the entire battle between the warden of the house of stone of omdurman and harry and abou fatma was created solely for action value in the film however despite this addition of action the movie still seems to drag at points films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel that is why they are only based on them however as i ve said a lot of the changes made seem senseless i would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels if they have an hour or two to waste those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else,negative
really delightful and has stood the test of time my recording had a few hic cups with the lighting in one of the acts music lovely as were the costumes and scenery can recommend,positive
nothing not even a trailer what a wasted opportunity for a commentary by west \( who does do them he did one for when a stranger calls \) or a retrospective featurette all you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between cusack s character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie,negative
every time this movie comes on my husband \( who is english \) and i watch it and laugh our heads off if you have ever been in an english train station drinking weak watery cups of tea out of dirty cracked cups smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there and not to be crule but these are not exactly a couple of sex pots the thought of two stodgy old english people being driven wild by their passion for each other is well hilarious i give it 5 stars for being so darn funny oh and the music please but it is worth watching for a good laugh,positive
after watching harsh times we wondered is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life we couldn t believe what we were watching it was meant to be the new 2006 version of training day they even got christian bale to play the lead role but only in the eyes of the people involved in it it was a miscalculation and we ll explain why brief story the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of l a jim davis \( christian bale \) is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran now in the states he is looking for a job as a cop jim s best friend mike alonzo \( freddy rodr guez \) is also unemployed but when his friend comes to visit they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities selling drugs guns getting high just to name few to spend time with his friend mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia \( eva longoria \) making her believe that he is looking for a job she doesn t know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face review harsh times has many problems but the most notorious one is the crime video game feeling it has throughout the film the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a grand theft auto or scarface the world is yours video game adaptation with a little bit of cheech chong in the mix there is no climax we just see them driving to different places arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end christian bale s accent in this movie doesn t help either not only it changes through out the film but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager like also there is no chemistry between them the acting in this movie is disappointing especially from bale who we liked in movies like american psycho batman returns and the prestige it is clear that he was miscast this time he just cannot do what denzel washington did in training day because of his accent and terrible acting in this film we believe this is his worst performance to date this is something he doesn t want to add to his resume the verdict christian bale returns but this new american psycho cannot find his equilibrium harsh times tries too hard to create the edgy dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that training day had but it doesn t even come close to achieve that goal we laugh at the silliness of the story overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent,negative

believe the good reviews written here about this film i havent cared much thus far for the movies penn has directed after this one i suppose its because i feel this is such a great film he created a tough act to follow but even if he never does top it he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time i like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into and this is one of those although i would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas but overall this is a great movie with great performances by all and it packs an after punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over im not easily touched by most movies but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits its without a doubt one of my favorite films this is the kind of film that reminds you movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art,positive

this is one of the better historical dramas from the 1970s many are stagey and slow and while this production of madame bovary is very much constrained to stay indoors this works to advantage for this story of a woman who feels so trapped by her life and her world emma bovary is not a very sympathetic creature she is married to a man who loves her with all his heart who tries to give her everything she wants is willing to ruin himself to make her happy and she still cheats on him and remains miserable in short she is selfish and inconsiderate as ugly inside as she is pretty on the outside francesca annis plays emma she is indeed very beautiful as an actress she often comes across as bright and hard flirty and flighty but cold and self satisfied these qualities of course are perfect for this character here she seems to be more in love with the idea of being in love than actually loving almost anything to break up the dismal tedium of her life and her disgust with everyone and everything in it it is very hard for a modern audience to feel sorry for her her daily trial does not include housework or drudgery she has maids for that she is bored because she is useless she is useless because she is too lazy to seek something meaningful to do she wants life to be a party and resents it when it is not tom conti plays her devoted husband who is completely devoid of ambition in work or society as an actor conti often seems to have just woken from a nap and this dampness is just right for dr bovary he too is very lazy in his way but his seems to stem from ignorance when contrasted with emma s willfulness her husband seems the infinitely better of the two conti is really fine here as a man completely out of his depth with this racehorse of a wife in much the same way while annis is briskly carrying every scene conti just quietly steals every one of them a perfect pairing for these roles all the actors here are top notch and the casting a bit off beat which adds to the interest the costumes especially emmas are a luxurious parade of overindulgence absolutely beautiful while we as an audience enjoy the parade of finery we can also see how this wardrobe would drive even the richest man into the poorhouse the production is topped off with a novel and lovely score of predominantly piano compositions pretty and liltling but melancholy and dissonant don t let this one get lost in the shuffle it is worth seeing,positive
eddie and rose are meant to be in nicole savoca s dogfight this is a warm and wonderful movie those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can it s sad that so few people have heard of or seen dogfight how a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me many others have synopsized the story so i wont be repetitive i will say that this movie s genius is in its acting river phoenix and lili taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends and it shows in scene after scene river gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse absurdly young jarhead eddie about to ship out to vietnam his coming of age is the narrative behind this movie while rose s idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the dogfight make her character angelic the poignancy of the closing scene in which eddie embraces rose in tears after having lost his three best friends during the vietnam war will stay with you for a long time dogfight is a unique and touching film it harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as romantic by hollywood today,positive
why on earth am i giving this movie five stars its plot is minimal the script has words and phrases i ve never heard and i m not sure were ever really used in the real world and to top that off it s more than a little unbelievable however despite all of the possible downsides i really enjoyed it honestly i m normally not into these kinds of films but it was just good fun the humor wasn t disgusting and gross the chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable \( even if i don t ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario \) and there wasn t some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat all in all it was just a fun movie to watch and it s been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face,positive

in my 1 3 2007 review of the harry potter dvd series i said about alfonso cuar n s direction of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban that perhaps cuar n held back from doing his own thing because chris columbus had directed the previous harry potter releases and had oversight to azkaban well the notion that cuar n was holding back in his potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing children of men cuar n can indeed make a great movie and could have made azkaban great but it was just good greatness clearly shines through when cuar n is turned loose with his own film and children of men is a good example children of men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith and this is apparently what cuar n does best \( see 2001 directorial of oscar nominated y tu mam tambi n \) in children of men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born the result chaos clearly the end of the world is near zombies might as well have taken over the earth and it was that zombie movie \( you know the good ones like 28 days later 2002 or dawn of the dead 2004 \) desperation that i was reminded of throughout children of men cuar n adapts p d james 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties but keeps the message pretty much the same the story is believably told and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through clive owen leads the cast and this guy just gets better and better in every film that i see him in he s supported by julianne moore michael caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in a list performances a fair amount of action suspense a very well told story everything that you need to keep you entertained and hey did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for children of men you don t get that too often anymore,positive
what a great cast i mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie right after it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it although you are shaking your head in disbelief stunning you ve never seen anything quite like it if you are a fan of the campy awful you may see it as a masterpiece if not you will still have a unique viewing experience proceed at your own risk borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it did i mention the great cast so many of my favorites even goodman can t save this clunker,negative
i will be utterly honest i don t buy music cds anymore with so many bands hitting the streets faster than i can imagine i honestly cannot keep up with them all music begins to sound the same corporations seem to have their pre determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion those like the simpsons backstreet boys and even hip hop artists are blending together to sound uniform unoriginal and overly drab i had nearly lost my faith in music retreating to some of my older music like dmb counting crows and travis but then i found the suns stumbling around the internet i discovered shockingly one of the videos to their album called romantic death it was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that i have seen in quite some time then it hit me i couldn t get this song out of my mind throughout the whole day i had the beat the lyrics and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind and i had only heard it once like a drug i needed more when i returned home that evening i found the song again and couldn t stop listening to it for the first time in a long time i had found a new band then i bought this album knowing nothing about the band except for the romantic death song i put this in my dvd player and continued to be impressed their videos are just as smart as their music their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk rock and even hard edge their lyrics seem well considered smart and a voice to a new generation my favorites of the album are must be you romantic death \( parental guidance is suggested \) lost at home rockstop we tried in fact every time i listen to this album i find a new song to explore a new song to jam to on the way to work a new song to enjoy for those skeptical of this band i suggest this album to test your tastes not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other cds which allow friends and family to explore this band but also all of their energetic original videos that will never see the light of day on mtv but can be watched from the leisure of your dvd player the sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry if the rockstops it ll be all my fault grade out of,positive
seriously i am an expert and this movie sucks but imagine for a moment yes stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound strikingly engaging and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals those experts whose tastes likes and dislikes decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all besides this interesting question which is put forth explicitly without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry and in about 60 seconds the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs,negative
i m the first to confess that i had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 robert wise gothic noir the house on telegraph hill but it doesn t matter because all the actors are good and combined with an extremely effective plot the movie is a terrific tale of murder deceit and assumed identities in post world war san francisco as was the fashion with many noir films of the time the house on telegraph hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine she tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened however the narrative soon jumps to germany at the end of the war and we meet victoria kopwelska \( valentina cortese \) is a polish woman imprisoned in belsen with her husband and family dead victoria tells the kindly american commander major marc bennett \( william lundigan \) that there s nothing for her back in poland desperate to survive victoria learns that her best friend has family in the united states and if they are ever freed she promises to take victoria to america with her her friend however is killed shortly before american troops can liberate the camp with nowhere to go victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend s papers and sail to america where she learns now the godmother to a young boy chris \( gordon gebert \) as well as the heir to a sizable fortune and a gorgeously gothic house high atop telegraph hill following the death of her aunt ensconced in the ostensible mansion victoria now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy s guardian alan spender \( richard basehart \) partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security as victoria becomes a mother to the boy she clashes with his governess margaret \( fay baker \) and coincidently reconnects with marc whom she met a belsen now a studly a playboy type lawyer all the adults are not as they seem marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money and victoria s arrival causes him to draft a new scheme victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good and then there s the margaret the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to chris are all they seem the film is compelling and tension fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white cortese is especially good in one of her first american roles and as victoria she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade yet through no fault of her own she steadily becomes a victim of alan s scheming of particular note are the stunning location shots of san francisco the main house is just beautiful and the scenes when victoria is playing baseball with chris offer stunning views of san francisco bay the house on telegraph hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers there s a runaway car poisoned orange juice an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity it all makes for a gripping and entertaining film victoria starts out as a victim and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on telegraph hill her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and chris mike leonard april 06,positive
the movie had potential good cast and interesting plot its the kind of movie you want to like but just can t i did not find it all that funny or romanic it seemed that the mother and a bride s maid were suppose to be funny characters but i found neither very amusing i have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie their relationship is not developed well at all as another reviewer noticed there is a bit of pretty woman here as dermot plays a male escort for whatever reason julia roberts as a hooker is cute whereas dermot is not i found is pretty disgusting that messing falls for a male prostitute there is a lot of crude sexual humor that i didn t care for my favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the english countryside which is really beautiful its not a terrible movie but i would be upset if i paid 10 to see it in the theater,negative
every lakers fan i ve ever met lives in the past sadly now to them the clock stopped when kareem and magic hung up the shoes and we know why magic had to leave their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding after this however they don t have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization the lakers have been a good team over the decades as apparent on this dvd set but the run of greatness is coming to a long slide with kobe driving the bus the lakers were once considered the green bay packers of the nfl but now they re just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the western conference which are much better than the present lakers i recently attended a game last fall at the staples center and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands i could barely hear myself think over phil jackson s mantra i told you so further illustrating how things have changed in la jack nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow so it is understandable that laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of magic and kareem than rather extol the diminishing skills of kobe since his colorado folly there are some good games on this dvd along with great moments from the baylor chamberlain west days i recommend any laker fan to purchase this dvd set to relive the past so laker fans keep living in the past if you so desire maybe kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the lakers to the nba championship promised land once again long live the forum or the staple remover center or whatever they are calling the lakers home now,negative
the quiller memorandum takes place back during the cold war it represented a time and place in history that was true at that time it accurately depicts an era that is now gone that some of us lived through the movie by today s standards is a little disjointed and incomplete it jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60 s or 70 s in order to get a g or gp rating as a result of those incomplete or cut scenes part of the movie makes no sense the movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author s original book the most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score including matt monroe s wednesday s child i was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later perhaps wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again quiller must have gotten lost on his way home,negative
until sam raimi made spider man i think we all regarded tim burton s batman as the best superhero movie \( even though i actually don t consider batman to be a superhero because he has no superpowers \) burton directed this movie and did a great job this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then michael keaton is batman bruce wayne needless to say batman is wayne s alter ego keaton is magnificent at playing the character s alter ego keaton also does a good job playing the character when he s not in costume keaton s bruce wayne isn t as gloomy as christian bale s was in batman begins which isn t necessarily a bad thing but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies but overall bale s bruce wayne is superior to keaton s because bale has a much more developed character to play however keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale the problem with this movie is that the joker \( jack nicholson \) steals the show the whole movie revolves around him so this isn t batman s movie this movie should have been called the joker so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton now you know the thing is the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality and they barely scratch the surface of the character s background we know practically nothing about wayne you d think the guy that s batman wouldn t be so uninteresting but we re bored to tears everytime wayne s onscreen \( and out of costume \) but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes he plays an even more menacing batman than bale so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton but keaton didn t have anything to work with so it s not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak but one of the strengths of keaton s performance is that if you ever met wayne he d seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman that s something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish but thankfully bale was able to do it michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred it s hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years i assumed michael caine s alfred wouldn t compare to gough s but i was wrong they re both great pat hingle was really good \( as commissioner gordon \) in this movie hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series and i enjoyed them both in batman returns but in batman forever i didn t like them nearly as much and in batman robin i found their characters annoying as hell vicki vale s \( kim basinger \) investigation into bruce wayne s background is completely uninteresting but i already knew what she would find out so maybe that s why i didn t like those scenes i also found the vicki character annoying screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen there s lots of little things i love in this movie the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him \( and the terrified expression of the gunmen \) with elfman s dramatic music blaring the look on napier s face when he sees the emptied safe when the guy got fried by the joker s joy buzzer \( one of the worst deaths i ve ever seen in a movie \) when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise and the joker s speech right before a mob boss dies the first action news report of the movie the way urgent is written in messy crayon on the parcel when batman jumps through the skylight \( accompanied by elfman s music \) the design of the batmobile minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave \( again elfman s music is awesome \) the grin on the young jack napier the batmobile attacking the chemical factory the joker s facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd when the bat signal is lit but it s not as awesome as the first time it s lit in batman returns or when it s lit at the end of mask of the phantasm and now a few complaints this movie featured too many songs by prince after a while they get unbearably annoying there were lots of other great 80s pop songs that could have \( and should have \) been used in this movie another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring by the way you can tell that nicholson s make up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking burton s batwing is cooler than schumacher s batwing \( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm \) anyway the targeting system of burton s batwing seems a little screwed up batman has a big red target locked on the joker but the plane s missiles and machine guns miss their target and the joker didn t even try to get out of the way looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems i always overlooked this movie s flaws \( until i saw batman begins \) for two reasons first of all i found keaton s batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie second of all the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is pretty much everytime the joker or the batman aren t onscreen the movie is boring but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie and nastier,positive
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i m a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging,negative

attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini series of its day it features a stellar cast including powers boothe as a crafty roman leader who tries to use attila to gain possession of rome gerard butler is attila the hun and he is everything about attila in this role never was an actor better suited his character is sharp passionate determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film he brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with boothe even more dynamic this is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes,positive
i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens book with my wife here are my gut impressions first very little is true to the book that s not really a gut impression that s the impression i got hearing my wife say that s not in the book that s not in the book actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling it makes for beautiful stills and pictures and those made me want to see the movie i expected a heart warming christmas story and what i got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out of control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why i m watching you get to see a kid chasing a ticket through a train a kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train a ticket making its way through the forest rube goldberg style back to the train \( forty minutes into this movie and one girl s train ticket is the star of the show \) ok the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have a train sliding out of control on the ice a train trying to outrun cracks on the ice a train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster \( fans of the coaster tycoon series of computer games will feel right at home \) until finally it arrives at the north pole then the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have a train car running out of control through santa s village kids getting lost in the christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory and then kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to santa s sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf ho ho ho at least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so i can help these kids out it s like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion you know it s awful but you can t look away and you d better think twice before letting any very young children see this it could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up my wife and i were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons and we were very glad that we didn t so what could have been a classic enduring and endearing compliment to a classic childrens christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn t advance the story or develop the characters one bit whatever a character driven story is this is the opposite never have i seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little i d rather set up my old american flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while i read the book to my kids,negative
i do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of buffy the vampire slayer as scaling operatic heights culminating with the glorious aria of becoming part 2 which i still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television i have ever seen in my life i have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life so i believe i can make a pretty convincing case we witnesses the potential of this series in season 1 when creator joss whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious angel was really a vampire who just happened to have a soul and loved the slayer until half way through the abbreviated first season in season 2 we find out just how far true love can go wrong love continues to be a very painful thing for the scooby gang as cordelia \( some assembly required \) xander \( inca mummy girl \) and joyce \( ted \) find out then again prospects look much better for willow \( phases \) although we never really do take the cordelia xander romance \( go fish \) to be anything more than a cosmic joke which does offer up the delightfully twisted bewitched bothered and bewildered as the exception that proves the rule \( footnote buffy spends most of the episode as the buffy rat because sarah michelle gellar was hosting snl that week \) of the off arc stories halloween and ted are clearly the best of the bunch but when it comes to romance buffy and angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions it is clear in the season premier episode when she was bad that things are different when buffy dances seductively with xander taunting him with her sexuality the ante has been upped considerably the pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 \( of 22 \) surprise when buffy unknowingly undoes angel s curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him why the gypsies put in the faustian \( in the goethe sense \) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive when angelus brutally slays jenny calendar in passion leaving her body in a grotesque display for giles to discover in his bed \( while opera music soars in the background \) it is the symbolic hellmouth of the show opening up the audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get only the worst is yet to come giles s anger buys him one shot at angelus but buffy has to rescue him they turn on each other in anger and buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other s arms buffy tells him i can t do this alone but this proves to be most ironically incorrect clearly whedon constructs each season around two half season story arcs the first half of season 2 heralds the arrival of spike and dru and the quick departure of the annoying one of course now we look back and are amazed at what james marsters has done with the role of spike but at this point it is juliet landau s ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side whedon brings the first half to a climax in what s my line the show s first two parter where we are introduced to kendra the vampire slayer it seems buffy s brief moment of death at the hands of the master in prophecy girl has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point but with the return of angelus everything changes spike and drusilla are trying to reassemble the judge a grotesque who cannot be killed by any weapon forged then everybody learns the truth about not only angel s transformation but also jenny s betrayal thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between angel and his former allies which culminates in the two parts of becoming both parts of becoming are written and directed by whedon and represent the apex of his work on the series when angeleus opens the portal to hell only his blood can close it but things are not going to be that easy for buffy the dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence \( with swords \) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by sarah michelle gellar s slow dissolve into tears while the haunting sarah mclachlan song full of grace is played joss whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series it is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season becoming is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up the original theatrical film was a teaser the first season on television was an appetizer but the second season of buffy the vampire slayer was epic and once you see this whether again or for the first time you are not going to want to stop here it was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the season 2 dvd collection especially since we expect more goodies from whedon and crew especially given the high quality of the watchers guide the show s official companion volumes there was a lot of thought put into this show which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated,positive

i rented this \( sigh \) several years ago liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but didn t open the new copy until the other day and watched it today i regretted buying a new copy after all remembering it only as a few heartwarming \( i didn t want my heart warmed \) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct \( incidentally the 3 girls are not sisters just 2 of them \) i made fun of it my friend made fun of it i watched a few minutes then turned it off then watched some more finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it it has charm it is a soap opera but i thought it was well acted and well done it had humor happiness sadness embarrassment \( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid s car \) love it had so much plot that it practically had none at all and i liked it but now 15 minutes later i m beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all no range no depth somehow he could carry a tune but that s about the size of it speaking of size the size of his ego \( which i assume is why he didn t deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics \) would have made a mushroom cloud i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing for it s kind i thought it was perfectly done i just like them a smidge more sophisticated the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious,positive
of course dead alive was the better movie but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate due to the fact that there is a high body count lots of over the top splattery deaths and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers some as zombie lunch apparently there was some footage cut out for this release i m not sure if that was gore footage or not but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence there is even some non gore grossout humor \( vomit related etc \) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground but again the influence is unquestionable don t expect the fx quality of dead alive though this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly i don t know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print transfer but it s a minor distraction they did a great job with a relatively small budget i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach s other films on us \( hopefully uncut \) dvd release i ve heard burning moon is especially crazy,positive
robert ryan made a number of westerns during the 1950s and 60s but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre nevertheless who can forget the wild bunch or his magnificent portrayal of old man clanton in the seriously underrated hour of the gun \( with james garner \) and his self effacing determination is equally unforgettable in the day of the outlaw now one of his best roles as the straight arrow sheriff in the proud ones is on dvd and available at a very reasonable price finally the proud ones is perhaps director robert webb s finest picture combining great action scenes and plot twists taught dialogue and a superior cast that includes not only ryan but jeffrey hunter walter brennan virginia mayo and robert middleton minor roles are given attention as well especially arthur o connell \( as ryan s deputy \) and important thematically the wonderful paul burns who plays the town drunk and panhandler hunter when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff will give alms to burns at the finish of the movie just as ryan did at the beginning when he was sheriff this touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about hunter s increased maturity the proud ones is a superb movie with a great story it will repay re viewing unlike some westerns i don t tire of watching it periodically it is that good,positive
first off robert deniro as the monster i saw him and immediately thought of jake lamotta or vito corleone they didn t even try to disguise his accent and no one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from new york second kenneth brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story finally the scene where elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous frankenstien s shock that she s not happy to be back burnt up cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest was supposed to be touching but i laughed we all know how great kenneth brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really really really bad i give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of aidan quinn s face,negative
to say this film is self indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement almost every joke in this movie that didn t center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of smiths other movies maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that but if you have only made 4 other films \( very poor ones too by cinematic standards \) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego the film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid although the humor really dosen t reach even that level here is a recap of the types of humor in this film making fun of fans fart jokes scatological jokes profanity \( yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself \) making fun of miramax making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film \( i swear i am not making this up \) and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew this movie comes across as crass tasteless profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects thank god i borrowed this movie and didn t pay anything to rent it i won t be watching another kevin smith movie anytime soon,negative
i just got my copy of the dvd r rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me since this scene is most appealing in the way the original version first displayed it in 85 to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely i was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie if anyone saw the unrated 1985 vhs version you would know what i mean lana was the movie why remove it i have not a clue unsatisfied customer,negative
if the writers intended to have a reset style ending all along or if they were forced to compress and compromise their original vision would be very interested to hear about the original ending envisioned \( and i don t mean that of ep 26 \) by the writers nonetheless after viewing the rest of wr one can t avoid watching these last 4 eps,positive
equilibrium is a curate s egg its best parts are not good throughout and its worst aspects make erratic appearances the acting is really the least of its problems the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up equilibrium however poorly aspires to be a dystopian film and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike such a formula was employed magnificently in michael radford s adaptation of george orwell s 1984 contrarily films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by alfonso cuaron s junky adaptation of p d james the children of men there are essentially three parts to this formula first there must be a depiction of a believable society and plausible justifications for its existence the author or script writer must paint vividly yet remain nuanced since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it second two thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist which formally unveils the ethical dilemma here the protagonist offers his alternative usually an acknowledgement of the humane third the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist s choice he must surrender to the system rebel against it or be conquered by it the ending if it is not tragic in the classical sense must be ambiguous if it is ended happily it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers thoughts the problem has been resolved and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it libria the society depicted in equilibrium is a post apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings and the actions carried out on their behalf represent the fons et origio of man s inhumanity to man the objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace is this believable ultimately it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved however a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war and aversion is something we principally feel a more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent the protagonist \( john preston a member of the grammaton cleric an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so called sense crimes \) marries begets children hesitates in killing his partner what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling and if we are being generous and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say you can never entirely eliminate feeling it fails still because if the denizens of libria weren t completely devoid of feeling they couldn t be as cowed as they are depicted instead countless times throughout the film characters make comments statements enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion to have had characters who were truly apathetic or for whom the fictitious drug prozium was effective they would have had more in common with star trek s borg the backdrop for this dystopia then lacks subtlety or nuance from the first fifteen seconds of film the viewer ethically objects it remains tediously manichean throughout the viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen in brave new world it is mustapha mond s conversation with john the savage in 1984 it is o brien s talk with winston smith in the children of men it is a debate between theo and the xan in equilibrium the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the matrix three years before here was the moment for the talky bit of the film the sophisticated counter punch the moral awakening the vindication of the human instead the viewer is given another low brow hollywood denouement john preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo there is no bit of dialogue with father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that feelings are essential to thought or that peace has been obtained at a terrible price all the loose ends littered liberally throughout the film are never addressed why have art in libria why does father intonate and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a leni riefenstahl propaganda film a better film would have acknowledged these scenes and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between john preston and father \( or dupont as it turns out \) the conclusion of equilibrium can be summarized as follows good guy kills bad guys sixty second revolution ensues people can feel again hero smiles time to go to bed there wasn t ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway what was wrong was obviously wrong and what was right was intuitively right the viewer never believed the reasons libria came to be or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found huxley s orwell s james zamyatin s or koestler s explanations in equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal unoriginal action movie to follow the plot then was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft core porn films they needn t be sensical because no one is interested in the story but rather for the titillation arousal and amusement many viewers of equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences \( a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest \) but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment during the film a woman asks preston why are you alive preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer i m alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society to serve libria it s circular you exist to continue your existence what s the point she asks and what s the point is exactly the point about this film,negative
panic room is a great thriller jodie foster s return to the big screen i d assume most people would enjoy the film itself however the real treat in the 3 disc special edition is the behind the scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture,positive
the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \),negative

what a horrendous experiment in comedy if you like jerry lewis i guess you ll love this travesty of a film if you are a film snob you will love it personally as neither i am grossly disappointed and just really didn t get the joke it was trite and dull there was no point the plot technology encroaching on humanity well good try but again not for me if i am looking for a laugh i will watch a good coen brothers film,negative
i was expecting to see a decent film by bava but after having seen about 5 of his films i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story this film is just like all the rest there is no point to any of it there is no plot and hardly any suspense suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult its quite tedious chris lee is rather banal also he doesn t do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio most of the cast is rather dull also supposedly playing some ancient noble family they look more like 1960 s mop heads and morons who were on too much acid the dialogue what there is is crude probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says i can t have more ice cream so i would suggest renting planet of the vampires because that is more enjoyable than this waste interesting character to note was lesmo dubbed as the european peter lorre who doesn t have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget,negative
me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever perhaps i m biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting,negative

for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the next riverdance the dancers are all talented if self consciously hip and in great shape but the numbers that focus more on t a than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me i love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms but ballroom dance is ott enough \( if you ve ever watched a competition \) and doesn t need to be tarted up beyond recognition the way it is here add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess,negative
the american dream is an appealing myth no doubt the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great the problem as george carlin put it is that you have to be asleep to believe in it so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs and that is where belly comes in an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it this urban drama stars dmx \( perpetually rapping \) nas and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot one couple tries to escape to africa but find it easier said than done and tommy \( dmx \) is sent on a mission to kill a minister but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn t even exist come on now i ve known drug dealers in my day and they didn t live in large gaudy mansions rap stars do rather they live in shacks or their parent s basement if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is the directing by hype williams isn t that bad he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks the lighting never seems quite right but i m gonna let that one slide as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used the n and f words are used to comedic proportions their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason and then on top of it all we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us sorry man but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn t make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks you re still a businessman this film is not worth watching any social point that is made is made accidentally and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta 1 4,negative
i saw this movie on t v for the first time a few days ago and now i m buying the dvd i m not a big fan of action movies but i do watch them now and again i ve read quite a few negative reviews about this film and i think they are undeserved when i saw it i thought it was good not diehard good but it held its own i really enjoyed it i really liked the idea that they included a female member of swat one never sees a woman swat member it looks like this is one of those movies you either love like or hate one has to make up one s own mind,positive
i like this movie a lot not just because it is made by visconti \( one of the greatest cinematic figures of the 20th century \) or because of its cast \( dirk bogarde and helmut griem are always good \) no i think it is the way the film attempts to look at a bigger picture through the corruption that surrounds a wealthy family that makes this film so interesting you can see elements of this style in other visconti films like the leopard in coppola s godfather trilogy and in fassbinder s maria braun now to speak of visconti s visual genius has there ever been a director who could sustain a scene in such a virtuosic way as in the nazi party scene midway through the film or again in death in venice with the scenes on the beach anyway enough of my babble just see the films of visconti and you will see what i mean,positive
this is one of the best g3s maybe even the best i would have said that it was definitely the best if not for mr malmsteen the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales but i don t want to be nice i want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to malmsteen he knows alternate picking i ll give him that but then so do i and a million others he shouldn t be up there playing with vai and satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most \( not all \) people and yet he is he shows over and over again in this show that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more that s all one of the interesting things about this dvd is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that yngwie chooses to execute it s less than about a second and this is an average figure enough about yngwie though he is the reason i m writing this review satriani is absolutely amazing as usual with a brand new rendition of midnight and a nice solo at the end of starry night vai though steals the show this coming from a guy who prefers satriani but i can t help it he is really that good and better i know you re here \( which he plays on a triple neck jem \) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you re taught at guitar school it is also the best song steve vai has ever written after fire garden suite juice and i m the hell outta here are also really really really good overall a great dvd though you should probably skip the parts with yngwie in it,positive
most people that like wes anderson s films are rabid fanatics and i m no exception so when the chance came to buy his first feature length film for 7 i snapped it up if you enjoyed life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums you ll enjoy this on some levels too many of anderson s classy touches are already in evidence in this film the story is fun and the characters are well developed yeah pretty much buy it if you like the wilson brothers or wes anderson the high point of the movie is certainly luke wilson s character masterfully done even in his first role,positive
undoubtedly the worst best of dvd ever made even if someone gives this dvd as a gift you should punch that person in the face after watching this dvd i felt like burning down the company that made this dvd if you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this dvd to him as a gift there might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror but it can t be for the actual dvd there aren t words to describe how bad it looks and sounds shame on the band for putting this out obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a best of on dvd this item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture my taped videos on vhs from mtv and vh1 sound and look better than these ones really this essay in amatuerism may have some interest for worse is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90 s to 2000 love is blindness walk on elevation and several alternative videos were edited out didn t they have another filmed version of gone mexico city 1997 was just a below average performance shame on u2 for keep going with gone from that bad shaped bono s rough night i still don t understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song i m talking about until the end of the world in case you don t know there s an actual video clip from that song rather they just put the well known sidney 1993 version here rumors say they re going to release a dvd boxset by late this year i really don t want remastered versions of shows we ve been watching for even 22 years rather i m fond of watching previously unreleased footage just in case here s a list of several unreleased pro shot filmed concerts from early 80 s to pop mart tour \( i didn t include elevation because there re 2 dvd s out there from the same tour \) cheers 1 belfast 23 01 1981 \( awesome concert \) 2 berlin 04 11 1981 \( great goncert \) 3 new york 22 11 1981 \( good concert \) 4 hattem 14 05 1982 \( awesome concert \) 5 roskilde 02 07 1982 \( awesome concert \) 6 devore 03 05 1983 \( great concert \) 7 st goarshausen 20 08 1983 \( awesome concert \) 8 dortmund 21 11 1984 \( awesome concert \) 9 montreal 27 03 1985 \( great concert \) 10 los angeles 18 11 1987 \( awesome concert \) 11 dublin 31 12 1989 \( awesome concert \) 12 stockholm 11 06 1992 \( awesome concert \) 13 washington 16 08 1992 \( great concert \) 14 anaheim 14 11 1992 \( awesome concert \) 15 dublin 28 08 1993 \( awesome concert \) 16 adelaide 16 11 1993 \( great concert \) 17 rotterdam 18 07 1997 \( awesome concert \) 18 sao baulo 31 01 1998 \( great concert \) 19 santiago 11 02 1998 \( awesome concert \) what the hell are u2 waiting for,negative
the perpetrators of a high level corporate scandal \( masayuki mori takashi shimura ko nishimura \) are pursued by the illegitamate son \( toshiro mifune \) of a low level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes but do they really sleep well,positive
briefly speaking if you liked tony jaa in ong bak you ll love the protector the plots are cut from the same mold \( in this movie jaa attempts to recover elephants instead of a statue head that were stolen from his village by ruthless criminals \) the choreography is faster paced and more dynamic \( and there s more of it \) once again showcasing jaa s fantastic martial arts ability since the script and the acting are not on the high end of the cinema achievement scale the producers were smart to put the emphasis on mindboggling stunts and martial arts choreography this movie is great i hope i m not placing a jinx by saying tony jaa is destined to become a legend he is the greatest martial artist we ve seen on screen in many years,positive
i have been following the laughing man fansubs so i ve covered all this material before i m acquiring the dvds as they come out to have legit copies the desc says 2 collectibles toys it s actually 3 there is batou on the plate like motoko from vol 3 in fact the base plates fit together which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set the other two toys are the chinese assassin with the gun arm and the old robot unit from the organ farming business \( with the fake southern accent \) these are easier to put together i had problems with the tachikoma from the last set it broke when i tried to put the legs on haven t gotten around to the super glue session yet the product itself stand alone complex 2nd gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced buy it share it with those persons worthy capable of appreciating it,positive
i viewed this dvd and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars this is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it s kind of lame it shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers i still have not made the connection as to why ron jeremy has anything to do with this documentary ladies if you are expecting to see skin this dvd shows very little others may have a limmited interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the us,negative
this is the french x rated version of 99 women directed by jess franco the running time of this feature is 98 minutes which means that this is probably the longest least censored version of the film that is available the story involves a women s island prison a sadistic female warden a lustful male governor and the young lovely female inmates can you see where this is heading there are scenes of extreme sexuality \( especially when you consider the film was released in 1969 \) which include \( \) my big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film in a few cases they don t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling \( standing in \) for just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying i guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969 but looking at the dumb story lousy editing and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective this is just a dated curio,negative

clearly this movie was never intended as high art or even a zombie gore fest although hyped as such so it s probably a bit unfair and easy to take shots at it however i think it fails on it own terms many spoilers to follow stop here if you plan to view the entire film the premise a group of stupid eco terrorists raid a research facility in london even though warned by a researcher release some highly agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a fast acting \( within seconds \) virus that transforms them into insane red eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches one drop of their saliva or blood can infect you the plague is let lose the hero cut to a skinny kid of about 110 pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed it s 28 days later and he wakes up but no one s there he then wanders around an empty london in hospital scrubs looking confused yelling hello hello there are no bodies outside and nothing that looks like the remains of one there are almost 15 million people in metropolitan london where did they go i asked myself the supporting cast he then wanders into a church and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people he yells hello at which time some start screaming and rush at him in the close up it s clear they have turned and he slugs the creature priest thing with his bag of coke cans he gets out more stuff happens eventually he meets smart and tough selena \( naomie harris \) armed with a matchete and mark \( noah huntley \) armed with a steel bar who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted hero who turns out to be a bicycle messager boy who lives with mum and dad seems the creatures come out mostly at night mostly hero insists on going home mark selena tag along we find his very middle class mum dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of booze and pills guess they could not live in a world without telly more talk and moaning and tears from hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some nasties more fighting bad guys are killed by selena and mark while hero cowers on floor mark gets infected denies it but is chopped by selena who can see it in his eyes damm girl if i m ever in a zombie movie i want you along day 2 comes the pair then wander aimlessly though london chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and at this point i start thinking wouldn t it be a good idea to get some guns preferably full auto with a lot of ammo i mean although the creatures are fast they are stupid don t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead police stations and military bases are all over london probably deserted and filled with guns but this doesn t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a baseball bat machette which you must get close to use emmmm i start squirming a bit in the seat and for the first time look at my watch but it s still kind of ok so far it s still a tight well made interesting film with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line and mostly believeable in it s own low buget post apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest maybe there a reason the hero is cast as stupid or will he grow and learn through experience maybe but it better be soon because we are almost 30 minitues into the film and it s getting real hard to identify with him or care the suporting cast 2 night falls our pair see flashing lights on the top of a high rise much action ensues they find more survivors just a average working type dad taxi driver and his young daughter more talk seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go north where the army \( who usually have guns \) has set up a secure area works for me after some debate on whether it better to stay where they are isolated in fact trapped on top of a building with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by zombies or travel north to safety in daylight and safety \( remember the monsters don t operate in daylight \) this group of dopes reluctantaly decide to go north in a taxi with no guns \( remember rule 3 of zombie films gun are good \) and at this point in time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity the journey of the dumb piling into dad s hack loaded with junk as if going on a brighton holiday with all even tough selena giggling and laughing off they go when faced with the choice of driving through a dark tunnel where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed or another safer route they naturally chose the tunnel stuff happens stopping to get gas the hero wanders alone into a dark confined space for no real reason armed only with a baseball bat more stuff happens stopping for the night they decide that a picturesque open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to you guessed it start a really big fire and go to sleep with no one on guard i m not making this up folks nothing happens however they do get to see a family of white and black horses running free and it s clear that we are no longer watching a horror action film with some internal logic but a trite message film they reach the army blockade but no one is there in spite of dead everywhere they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see more stuff happens after this the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point at the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic army major \( aren t they all though \) that the goon s can t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it think about that one we also learn that the virus is contact borne not airborne think hard about that one dudes since it started in one local it s very unlikly to have spread thoughout england in 28 days big plot holes dumb ending 110 pound stupid hero becomes arnold the terminator in 10 mintues girls decide it s far better to die a gruesom death then put out and lose their honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in cammos who are their only protection really dumb stuff after an excellent start sad this was a really superior film for the first 20 mintues,negative
having visited st petersburg russia a year ago i could not pass up the chance to watch this movie i must say it was nicely done i can relate to the obnoxious business like brother who happily did not go with me on my trip i was more like the care free younger brother but not quite so care free as the character protrayed the scenery was awesome all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie although i wish there were more because the city is full of beauty and this goes for the women as well i mainly went to see the city but i also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that i planned would be my travel companion what i didn t expect was to really fall in love \) the big reason why i confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to american women as if explained in the additional extras on the dvd but the russian lady that i met there and the culture of her up bringing quickly changed my way of thinking one thing i should add though the movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself such is not the case it takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here expect at least 8 months but it is more like a year it is time consuming to get her a us visa but she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover the wait is worthwhile another word of caution prepare yourself to fall in love with russia the people are very nice and i know of a lot of americans who go there quite often to visit and re visit some even live there now,positive
this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today s teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom s thing,positive

the door in the floor is difficult to like even \( or perhaps especially \) if you re a fan of john irving s book a widow for one year which was the source of this film the movie is dark depressing slow moving it also showcases the least likable characters from the book to make matters worse it focuses only on the first third of the novel s story which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated \( alienating \) couple s suffering the film is completely devoid of the novel s interesting more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family s life into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who aren t well developed in the film but who are central to the book s satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story this may give you an idea why the film wasn t very successful with audiences the theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people unfortunately the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents played by jeff bridges kim basinger in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons it wallows in the empty chasm that s grown between them delves into the sad meaningless even cruel love affairs they each engage in in vain attempts to ease their sorrows escape the pain of the love lost between them of course the greatest loss the loss of their sons the film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose and finally we witness the pain of their very young daughter who was born out of yet more of the parent s attempts to fill their empty sad lives and we re treated to a view of her pitiful childhood growing up with parents who truly aren t there the greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel and even worse why they chose to bring to life only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it if the theme of loss is one you re very interested in you might find this movie quite affecting as for me a great fan of the book i can only hope that someday someone makes a better more complete adaptation of this great book it s not nearly as desperate sad a story as this film version on subsequent viewings i ve grown to appreciate this film a bit more taken completely apart from the novel it s not a bad film undoubtedly the performances are wonderful however little fun they are to watch,negative
i agree with everyone that wants old nick i remember putting on the tv and watching legends of the hidden temple guts are you afraid of the dark and so on put them on dvd people would surely buy it,negative
the only reason why i stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because i paid to see it awful movie not entertaining at all it was just so poor the animation wasn t fantastic political messages shouldn t be in children movies not a good movie,negative
i can t believe how many people gave this awful movie good reviews the premise is absurd namely that anybody would even think about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place won t hang preposterous in itself for smoking some hash my advice to joaquin phoenix would have been sorry pal but get a better lawyer a ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent,negative
two of the worst stories in the history of tos but for different reasons the way to eden makes the mistake of trying to be trendy and so dates badly what the real problem is though is that it makes the enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment especially of all people captain kirk requiem for methuselah is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of da vinci brahms and others what it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for kirk s relationships with women threre is no way any woman would have kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her he is far to full of his own importance for that this effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode a real pity,negative
this dvd is a great complement to the dvd s offered by vce \( trinity and beyond nukes in space etc \) by itself it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials military equipment and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the dvd set the quality of the film varies between the three discs the last civil defense video on disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble unfortunately but it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format i ve owned trinity and beyond for several years and i really enjoy the way it is presented but it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it skims over a lot of information about testing procedures etc you begin to get the impression that the military was doing these tests for their own amusement after watching this dvd i have a much better understanding of the entire process it s easy to see why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days of the atomic weapons program the science of the atomic bomb was a moving target and this dvd outlines the research they made though i would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever again their sheer power is fascinating beautiful and frightening at the same time if you are interested in the science of atomic testing you should really take a look at this set,positive

therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages 13 14 15 16 and 17 cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run of the mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick \( of course \) but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines \( such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation \) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future,negative
the caribou population is declining at an alarming rate and the canadian government is concerned after a harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot brian dennehy government researcher tyler is dropped in the frozen middle of nowhere it s a kind of funny plane flight because it s so well done dennehy is a hung over buckaroo bonzai type independent flyer his little prop plane heavily laden with tyler s \( charles martin smith \) equipment has a tough time both taking off and later staying afloat the in flight repairs dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat although the photography is the great strength of never cry wolf the acting especially by smith and the editing are also nearly perfect as harrowing as the plane ride is it s a pretty safe bet the plane will land \( elsewise there d be no movie \) and tyler will find survival rather than research is the pressing order of business tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack kill one or two of the pack members and dissect them to discover if as suspected their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy caribou meat tyler laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet paper is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting up a research station on his own fortunately for him he ll be discovered rescued and befriended by two inuits the ancient ootek \( zachary ittimangnaq \) and his adopted son mike \( samson jonah \) as tyler notes in his voice over narration there are no orphans among the inuit ootek and mike will arrive and disappear a few times a wolf pack will be found and tyler will learn that man s relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he imagined i dislike most message movies they tend to distort characters and events and beat you over the head until you accept their point of view never cry wolf has a strong message about man and nature but it s such an entertaining movie i didn t feel like i needed to join the sierra club to enjoy it the story lines are clear and after the plane trip its plentiful humor is quiet and unforced smith who spends an awful lot of the movie alone acting under his voice over narration is nuanced and convincing jorah and especially ittimangnaq are both good and both add a layer of authenticity to the film and the photography is at times breathtaking never cry wolf is a gem,positive
i finally found out this was out on dvd after having the vhs version for many years the dvd edit is very close to the vhs version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act plus some video strobing added during cindy lauper s run down the runway which i m not sure was really needed but i m ok with it although the video strobing was done again later which seems to me as a cheap effect that really doesn t add to the performance i think brian adams and cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid i thought originally sinaed \( sp whatever \) was a strange choice at the time maybe good for the part but after seeing the documentary i see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end she s too instable and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event nor did she show any respect for the part speaking of which all of those artists that were called to perform at this event and didn t say yes on the first call shame on you if roger calls you for an event you say yes and put whatever you re doing aside because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with i wish there were more documentary material with this dvd as this was such a big event there should have been more information i had heard in an interview before the show that roger was once asked if he d ever do the wall again and he basically said if the berlin wall would ever come down then i would consider doing it again and this was never mentioned in the doc buy the video even if you have the vhs you ll enjoy it still waiting for pulse to be released as well enjoy,positive
i watched this film yesterday at a library and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding during the first minute they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising during the next 99 minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence using acted scenes fake blood and sound bytes from scholars to give a play by play summary of the carnage and beheadings leading up to a mention of napoleon during the last thirty seconds they surprisingly conclude by saying that the french revolution was a very good thing because it inspired china and vietnam and because louis was a tyrant prior to this little or no mention had been made of louis tyranny although the film had dwelt on his bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times after watching 90 minutes of bloody scenes i found the films conclusion that the french revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur i would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion,negative

house of mirth is one of the most depressing movies i ve ever seen to be clear i ve seen movies like oh say schindler s list or the heart is a lonely hunter that treat tragic events either in the macrocosm or the microcosm that did not leave me depressed rather they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think house of mirth deals with tragic themes including human society s ability to destroy its own and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites it wasn t though moving or thought provoking i wasn t moved by gillian anderson s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor i didn t believe gillain anderson s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor rather i was bored i kept wanting the film to go faster it s a great irony edith wharton s novels are real page turners quick to the point hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality house of mirth has gorgeous clothing and sets i didn t care about anybody onscreen though i didn t believe anybody onscreen i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces as if to prove these points people are hypocrites see people are insincere see if a person has any decency at all that person is destroyed see i would tend to agree with all of the above points so why do i need to watch this movie also as a woman who as lily bart was meant to has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that i felt that this movie no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally betrayed lily bart lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film she all but participates in her own destruction you want just once for her to show some initiative some intelligence some ability to create her own fate the film denies her those abilities in this crippling of lily bart the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does movies like gone with the wind that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning and occasionally gaining some power imo are much easier to watch one might argue that such films are not realisitic i don t know even we real life lily barts have our resources and our triumphs and again watching lily bart in house of mirth slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine,negative
they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome then all of the sudden the paid wwe guys just began to bad mouth the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young and i really can t distinguish one s ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use which drugs presumably they re talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let s not talk about that let s just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him i don t he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk and oh yeah they don t even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from imdb com that he was asked to appear but declined why don t they address this this docu is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking,negative

well you know the drill some people will like anything that is artsy or out of the ordinary or made by that great director its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless the movie is about incest it is about sex and adolescence and ironically it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews the best part of this movie is eva green or more precisely eva green s body i didn t care about her acting \( i thought it was mediocre \) i just sat there and drunk her body in wishing that i was that lucky actor \( whats his name again \) the only reason to watch this movie is eva green if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation then i am glad it happened the movie is visually rich in fact its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see but i will take it he captures and celebrates eve green s stunning body every square millimeter of it \( including her genitals the movie is nc17 for a reason \) to perfection other than that there is nothing else in the movie the story is utterly insipid the old movie clips the discussion of morality or whatever nothing interesting the music is another plus point bottomline watch it for eva green s body it deserves five stars but the movie deserves only two,negative
the show is absolutely great blue falcon is another space ghost and dynomut is the futuristic version of scooby doo dim witted and loveable getting the complete show is great and the shows from these hb vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors \( amid some nasty scratches and dust but it was cheap animation folks \) as a scooby fan this is a must own i quite enjoy the blue falcon dynomut show also 5 stars for the show the set however nice still drops the ball you get two single sided dvds and two flippers the problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1 16th of an inch between them both i know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear but then again if it was a perfect world we couldn t complain all in all a solid set 4 1 2 out of 5,positive
went to see this movie at the imax in san antonio this weekend i have to say i actually laughed most of the way through the effects were decent but most of the time i had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3d effects that was when i wasn t having to look around the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie some of the torture scenes and the faustian plotline along with the hideous firey face that is mr d make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10 but the terrible plot along with the worst voice acting i have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10 basically i guess you could say i was slightly displeased with the movie i do have to admit that i got a hearty laugh when the main character johnny \( played by jasper steverlinck an up and coming rocker and lead singer of the band arid a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot i could find in the movie \) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil mr d and destroy the haunted castle unfortunately the scene was designed to be serious,negative
one of the best directed films of 2006 kiss kiss bang bang is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences and even though kiss kiss bang bang may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid fire dialogue or to untangle the plot one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill it s a class a tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that shane black pulls off here with kkbb s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead serious drama to gallows comedy if that seems like an easy feat well remember 1941 not even spielberg got it right but shane black nails it here and it s his directorial debut downey kilmer are also at the top of their game here but it s michelle monaghan who impresses with a flat out great performance that keeps up with the veterans sui generis \( one of a kind \) is the phrase that best describes kiss kiss bang bang although it s remarkably mainstream at times it s a showcase of talents for everyone involved and when the bullets aren t flying there s even a romantic comedy here social commentary to boot i can t think of any other film quite like it and that s just how the warner brothers tradition seems to work \( at its best \),positive

this is the 6th and last entry in the series lone wolf cub this one not only has a different director than kenji who directed 4 of the others this is the entry most like a comic book \( the series is based on a famous comic book series \) not that that is bad the whole series fluctuated between great period detail serious themes and not taking itself too seriously it was at once graphic and fantastic realistic and wildly improbable factual and imaginary serious silly that s what made it so damn interesting throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of japan tracing actual historical roads and cities now we end the series in the mountains and the snow the white heaven in hell of the title this entry has a lot of stuff going on lord retsudo of the hated yagyu clan ogami s arch enemy sends his last child a daughter to do in ogami with her falling dagger technique when predictably she fails he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe the downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in her majesties secret service but it ain t bad that ogami s baby cart guns never seem to need reloading etc are minor quibbles if ogami doesn t shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them behead them or run em through red sprays all over the white snow anyway they wind the series up with a bang one of the strangest most unique and unusual series ever produced anywhere worth it if you don t mind the violence,positive

as a character movie this is largely a failure unless you find poignancy in average ness the characters are all one note half stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non existent plot oh look how average they are isn t it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing it s so lifelike and the main character s seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her if this is intended to be an issue movie with the message robert ebert has suggested \( that anti abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women \) it s taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows munich and syriana also bring to light ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things perhaps next they ll make a movie to make the point that shockingly enough the sky is blue or that paint dries when applied to walls or that grass grows i imagine they d be somewhat more interesting than this effort,negative

5 stars to the film itself here s a painful study of a woman s descent to lunacy amidst a desolate uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste the character study is not unlike claustrophobic polanski s repulsion but dwells on vitti s being consumed by her external surroundings as opposed to deneuve s intensive plunge to schizophrenia the pace and landscape is virtual antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who are not familiar with the director s works one of his greatest works \( l avventura remains his best to me \) the only problem is the dvd transfer i ve seen the vhs and it has a consistent hue of orange the dvd although sharper and clearer fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges in long shots for a film that essentially deals with color \( it was antonioni s first color feature \) the transfer was rather clumsy and careless the sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement why didn t criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film,positive
maybe it s because i had never read the book and never heard of hunter s thompson before this movie but i found this movie to be unbearably boring and so utterly pointless at what point in the movie making process while reading the script aloud did they realize that this isn t a movie or maybe that the book couldn t be made into a commercial movie the story if it can be called such is apparently about a journalist and his fat hispanic friend \( called his lawyer \) who go to las vegas to write an article on some motorcycle race of some sort or something that s completely irrelevant because probably 5 10 minutes is actually spent on that subject with an additional 20 minutes at most devoted to the guy actually trying to accomplish the task the rest is just johnny depp as the main character rambling mindlessly about a variety of subjects most of which deal with drugs or drug related things others having nothing at all to do with anything they are quite literally taking every drug known to mankind and the movie chronicles them taking drugs there are some scenes in which the duo are in their hotel room where the lawyer freaks out in a bathtub and threatens to kill himself in other scenes they are in the hotel club or at a restaurant no matter where they are they are always high on some drug and johnny depp s character \( thompson himself based on his experience under a fake name \) is rambling or talking very very quickly and nonsensically there are cameos by minor celebrities some of which are world famous today gary busey is on screen for all of three or four minutes as a highway sheriff who sexually harrasses jd s character tobey maguire is on even less as a hitchhiker who bails out of the car when he realizes the duo are stoned out of their mind and crazy the only moment in which i had a great laugh was in the beginning where they are hallucinating that they are being attacked by bats as they drive down a desert highway when the lawyer stops to pick up the hitchhiker jd s char says we can t stop here this is bat country that line and its delivery alone deserve the movie its one miserable star i expected better from terry gilliam if this movie was attempting to be shocking or pro or anti drug or stylish or artistic in some way it is obviously only a most acquired taste like a group of people who think consuming waste is an acquired taste there is no moral message here nothing pro or anti drug nothing shocking save that these two aren t dead by the third day from taking so many drugs or stylish or artistic not the worst movie ever but definitely one of them i don t know what orifice people pull this great movie idea out of but i d like to examine that and find out why,negative
this film starts out so promising it could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief and the legitimacy of the concept of free will instead the characters dribble into infantile sexuality and the film becomes a travelog i can t believe this film found financing a real waste of obvious talent the effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste,negative

harry potter and the chamber of secrets the second harry potter film in the series was the first bit of the harry potter phenomenon i was every exposed to i d kind of avoided the boy wizard before then but after seeing it those couple of years ago even though i didn t entirely follow what was what and who was who i realized it was pretty entertaining after reading the second book recently i picked up the dvd and watched it again the series gets a little darker like the books do but unlike the book i don t think the jump is as large which i reckon is a good thing though i prefer the first film it s still good to watch it s harry s \( daniel radcliffe s \) second year at hogwart s wizards school and after a shaky summer he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot it seems a certain heir of slytherin has opened the legendary chamber of secrets loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students literally many fingers point to harry harry s finger points to malfoy and ron s wand well that doesn t point at all as its broken and backfiring what s this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders haunted toilets a rogue quidditch bludger and a self flagellating house elf can harry ron and hermione figure things out all the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film plus the boys voices are breaking in some scenes they re kind of croaky sounding in other scenes they have their child voice and in others their voices broken through not neccesarily in that order there s a couple of new kids \( like colin creevey \) and they are just as well cast as the others the new adults are well cast too though not my favorite performance of his career shakespearean actor kenneth branagh makes an interesting gilderoy lockhart the vain second year dark arts teacher he played it a lot more subtley than i expected him to ex fast show comedian mark williams plays mr weasley which i reckon was a great choice i missed some of the cast from the last film though you hardly see warwick davis \( who plays professor flitwick \) let alone hear him say anything and john cleese s nearly headless nick who has a rather significant deathday party in the book has hardly anything to do here except get petrified there were other things cut out too like the catching of the garden gnomes at the weasley s the fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though personally i like to think of the harry potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion rather like the pictures in the world of hogwarts they give an idea of what the book would look like an impression special features include an interview with author j k rowling and script writer steve kloves as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors there s also slick virtual tours through diagon alley dumbledore s office and gilderoy lockhart s classroom \( a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is complete with gushing praises from the narrator \) there s also a couple of games you can visit the chamber of secrets after answering some harry potter trivia you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest \( which i found frustrating but addictive \) there s also a trivia game about what spell does what too unlike the first dvd you don t have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes you re able to go to them straight from the main menu just as well there s 19 of them and some of them are pretty significant notable scenes include harry s close encounter with the malfoys in the dark magic shop harry discovering that filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence i wish they d left some of these scenes in particularly the ones where harry potter questions his nature is he a good wizard or a bad wizard that was some mighty fine character development cut there there s also a gallery of design drawings and a section called colin creevey s darkroom where you can select pictures of various characters then play them in a slideshow of sorts apparently there s a whole stack of stuff in the dvd rom features but i just couldn t get them to work on my laptop s dvd drive using interactual player \( the player that many warner brothers films have you install to play their dvds \) it says there is a script error and when i tried windows media player 9 and cyberlink powerdvd 4 0 though it ran the dvd and everything else with it fine the dvd acted as if it wasn t in a dvd rom drive telling me that if i put the dvd into my pc s drive i d get all these wonderful features it was in my dvd drive aggh it is in a dvd drive maybe its just my type of laptop \( benq dh5100u 1 5 gigahertz \) ah well it looked like it would have been really fun especially for fans of the series all in all its definitely worth a look for harry potter fans but i would recommend you read the book first,positive
the main character came across as gay to me too this movie is in no way realistic the other reviewer is right about everything it s a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick the martial arts in the movie are weak and sloppy there s no way that crap would actually work in real life i don t even know why i bothered to watch the whole thing i guess i just found the stupidity amusing the cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie unfortunately that s the only thing they put much effort into i rented it from block buster too they need to burn it this movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something like they had to make a movie to pass drama class,negative
the so called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor a three year old will laugh at anything every turn of the plot is stupid this is in the running for the worst movie ever made i don t trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now i think he is a very good actor it s a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in to get his career going,negative
con express has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action isn t enough and in between stunt pieces and shoot outs the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions isn t really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a big budget company producing this i d be inclined to pan it entirely but i wasn t expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over the top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably won t mind this one too much just go easy on it,negative

i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that don t make sense,negative
i can t believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video easy to master i found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow the camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork i am an athletic twenty three year old girl who is not a slow learner i just excercised with this dvd for the first time and it was really tough i didn t get a work out at all because i was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much she doesn t break down the moves at all and it s just so much more confusing than it needs to be the dances are cute but it s frustrating that she doesn t explain the moves i hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing,negative
i totally love this dvd they really show how to do grooves not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video these are grooves you can make your own and go and dance any where with that what i think makes this dvd series totally different from the rest the moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch it goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it love it love it love it i am hooked on the groovaloos,positive
another product of hollywood s karaoke culture in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in u 571 an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap flag waving pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies \( german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors \) and absurd scenarios \( an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit \) put this ridiculous movie in its own category u 571 is just another thin over promoted throw away movie you ll forget the day after you see it,negative
this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list and is probably the best mainstream hollywood movie i can think of i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well great performance by all cast but especially hanks paxton and beacon probably ron howard best film ever,positive

the essence of painter francis bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life seen through his central nervous system and eyes we experience his world of fragments like collage pieces of existence the only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting otherwise he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being himself together tellingly one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one on one job with his lover george in his paintings of george however he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with george that sums up bacon his art and his life in a nutshell bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art yet he is also the most alone person imaginable something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay one of the very best films about an artist ever made you don t need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here if you want to see his paintings you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute or less using any visual search engine,positive

it s always a shame to see a really talented actor actress star in a dud of a movie but that s exactly what happened to jodie foster with 1979 s foxes directed by adrian lyne who would later go on to direct the notorious fatal attraction foxes is a cheap lame brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life the movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another making it hard to stay focused the movie isn t a total waste a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention and jodie foster still under 18 when this was filmed has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn t given much to work with plus that piano melody of donna summer s on the radio which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel overall though foxes really is pretty lousy and can t be given much of a recommendation,negative
this pilot is so bad the acting the writing the directing the costumes it s a miracle that b5 ever got even one season approved by the suits at least they could have gotten decent actors pretty much every character on this pilot is represented by a piss poor actor and the writing is grade school \( i think this is what real people do \) tripe horrible rotten useless junk,negative
bob clark s 1974 chiller classic which went on to inspire many elements of halloween and when a stranger calls is definitely one of the better if not best horror films out there period not high on blood but very high on suspense dread atmosphere and out of the dark surprises a sorority house \( to include the lovely olivia hussey the vulgar alcoholic margot kidder and sctv vet andrea martin \) falls victim to vicious violent and altogether menacing phone calls during the christmas holidays soon students on campus begin turning up missing though some events do go unexplained \( which could be positive considering the mystery involved \) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films with the most tense moody photography ever captured on film keir dullea and margot kidder turn in quite effective performances highly recommended,positive
the manchurian candidate is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring frank sinatra this film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone this is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies afraid to assert a viewpoint the script meanders denzel washington plays the sinatra role of ben markoe he seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines washington normally a gifted actor plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role markoe discovers that his gulf war comrade in arms raymond shaw soon to be the next vice president of the united states has been the subject of mind control experimentation by manchurian global a vast multinational conglomerate raymond s handler is his senator mother \( meryl streep in the role of an ice queen \) by diluting the threat from communism to capitalism the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story after all it is no great achievement to convince a major american political candidate to back big business and so the grotesqueries of shaw s brainwashing get lost against the backdrop seeming less heinous than merely greedy even when shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious amoral and possibly incestuous mother why the film created the unlikely manchurian global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the manchurian global mindset that has gripped hollywood god forbid we should point a finger at mainland china \( or anyplace else \) it might reduce the bottom line this film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original,negative
my kids \( age 5 7 and 10 \) love this movie i actually bought the vhs version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the dvd so we could watch it in the car when while traveling my husband and i originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it s nice that we can share it with our own kids now if you love animals this movie is for you the dvd jacket says this movie took a few years to make and i believe it it s absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other this has got to be one of the best animal films out there,positive
this is not the restored print of dracula 1931 that universal previously released on dvd a few years earlier if you have that dvd keep it as the quality on this box set is awful i can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this didn t bother to look or didn t know that universal had a fully restored copy of this film,negative
it has been a long time since i read the novel upon which this book is based but i do clearly remember it making sense this movie doesn t even make sense \( to quote a chicken i know \) marlon brando somnambulizes his way through the film and instead of coming off as sinister menacing and dominating he makes dr moreau into a joke val kilmer s portrayal is vacuous and silly is the character supposed to be under the influence i guess he wanted it portrayed that way the script is there one moreau talks about having almost reached his goal where his one son and his daughter do have some fine traits but both are also pretty ineffectual several reviews have mentioned the special effects i actually saw very few special effects the rat people on the boat were creepy and well done and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves but mostly i saw people in very elaborate well done costumes using well distorted voices the central character played by david thewlis should have been the focus of the movie as he is the narrator he kept getting lost in the shuffle and i kept waiting for him to see things that i saw and to ask the questions that i would have asked i like him as an actor but this is certainly not a memorably good performance it is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal human hybrid horror here but is the werewolf in harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the film does create a sense of the nightmare several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness most notably ron perlman s preacher but then he s well practiced from his beauty and the beast television series that was what \( barely \) earned this film its second star let s vote them all off the island and start over robert duvall as moreau replace kilmer with matt damon casey affleck replacing david thewlis,negative

i love this old documentary capt clark gable does an excellent job narrating it the color footage is a rare treat and it gives an excellent insight into the day to day lives of those from the greatest generation it is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in wwii and we need to remember their service and sacrifices they fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in iraq or afghanistan plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn t have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones we need to remember them as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone but their legacy remains and it is films like this one that preserves it,positive
i m pretty new to the yoga experience i started with a kathy smith dvd \( hated it \) then i got a yoga zone video the one for flexibility and toning and i found it to be very good i then got another video yoga shakti which is excellent too and i was looking for another beginner video \( the yoga shakti one has some advanced parts in it \) so i bought yoga zone introduction to yoga while some of the moves in it are on my first video i still found this to be very good for beginners alan again teaches you the breathing technique which i often forget i noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it yes it does move slow however if you re a beginner and you re just learning the poses the last thing you would want is for it to move fast he takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you re doing it his voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind i honestly have to say that if i did not originally buy a yoga zone dvd i more than likely would not have pursued the practice i think that yoga zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more i highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga lite out there,positive

this film is one big joke you have all the basics elements of romance \( love at first sight great passion etc \) and gangster flicks \( brutality dagerous machinations the mysterious don etc \) but it is all done with the crudest humor it s the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately get or you don t that is a matter of taste and expectations i enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s when nicolson and turner were in their primes the acting is very good if a bit obviously tongue in cheek recommended,positive
i was introduced to the matthew shepard story by mtv s dramatic presentation of matthew s last days in laramie with that as my background i entered the laramie project with curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie s townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention matthew was a human being undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents but not everyone shared that view that fact was refreshing the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent other laramie residents were just as horrified the so called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected but equally unnerving this film though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed has the feel of a documentary knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times but the presentation was enlightening the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that crimes no matter what a person s viewpoint lifestyle or background no one has a right to take on the position of punisher humans are not animals or at least they shouldn t act like them the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder it is worth the watch,positive
this documentary on the life of louis armstrong one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of music is a quick look at how louis armstrong developed into a jazz musician as a vocalist trumpeter band leader and arranger louis armstrong satchmo starts with louis s life growing up in new orleans and how he spent much of his time in an orphan home playing in a band which is where his skill had room to take off the documentary follows his move to chicago and his involvement in the early jazz recordings the dvd contains excerpts of live performances and also tracks louis armstrong s gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the nickname satchmo louis with his love for performing became a famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of being featured as a performer in many movies the docu biography reveals how louis never lost his lovable down to earth manner even with the increased size of his audience louis was just louis and he would always be loved for his smile his lovable personality and of course his music containing interviews with tony bennett and wynton marsalis louis armstrong satchmo is a pleaser about a jazz player s rise to become an enormously famous popular entertainer and he never lost his charm we love you louie,positive

i am a faithful csi watcher and have been since the shows inception i buy the dvd sets and enjoy them tremendously however there are two trends i see developing that i don t care for one there is too much catherine we know everything about her kid her dead husband her crook father etc and she s really an annoying character she makes nasty comments about everyone she s always being insubordinate she goes out with men half her age \( let s quit trying to make her seem like a young chick when she isn t especially wearing those skin tight jeans \) she is very arrogant and even though she continually screws up \( loses her camera blows up the lab in a previous season accuses people before she has all the evidence \) they made her a supervisor also the plot line with grissom and sara while predictable is not the greatest i think grissom would be better off paired with lady heather there s an idea let s see more of lady heather still even with the annoying overabundance of the least likable character \( catherine \) the show is one of the best if not the best on tv \( up there with without a trace ncis and numbers \) keep em coming,positive
apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film but when i re watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so i found it to be well nearly unwatchable what s so bad about it well how shall i begin \( 1 \) sean connery is a dud there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond but here he seems like he s just going through the motions to be fair he had no decent material to play the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007 he seems suitably worn out at various points and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before but these are grace notes by and large connery is stiff as a board here \( 2 \) the action scenes are uninspiring i m not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes here the action is strictly second rate \( 3 \) kim basinger and barbara carrera though great to look at give terrible performances \( 4 \) there is literally no reason to see this in favor of thunderball of which it is a remake the original remains one of the all time great screen entertainments and this remake makes zero improvements in fact the plot merely becomes muddled \( 5 \) there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles rowan atkinson s comic scenes though brief are painfully unfunny not to mention out of place the actor playing the new m is odious and whoever it is playing q isn t very good either \( 6 \) the music is bad the title song is boring and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon i couldn t care less that the james bond theme is missing it s not what isn t there that s bad it s what is there all in all i d have to say that unless we re counting the 1967 version of casino royale this is the worst of the james bond movies it s worth seeing if you ve never seen it before but that s about it in my opinion,negative

i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly \( ex one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static \) the costumes were well selected but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard \( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face \) this version follows the book well though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the drink me bottle i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film i recomend this to fans and people who aren t overly critical of films,positive
jackie chan and chris tucker deliver once again in this follow up to their great film rush hour this film follows on the premise of the first with a bit of a reversal this time tucker is the fish out of water in chan s hong kong as with my review of rush hour i ll say up front that if youre looking for anything more than a fun filled actioner then this movie wont please you it breaks no new ground and the plot is quite formulaic but if you re looking for deep drama and character development what are you doing watching a chris tucker movie watch for a great cameo by don cheadle as a black man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a chinese soul food restaurant in a black section of los angeles that alone is worth a laugh there is another stand out cameo by jeremy piven as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple be sure to watch the end credits and catch all of piven s ad libbed outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor but then as with all jackie chan films half the fun is watching the flubs during the end credits,positive
absolutely unwatchable cliche ridden so silly it s very nearly offensive it s like watching one long music video by a b level rapper full of dumb beautiful women buff monkey headed ghetto thugs and jokey tricked out cars without a doubt one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the script is laughable the acting worse vin diesel and paul walker are more dumb and dumber than butch cassidy and the sundance kid awful,negative

yeah it s true this movie is awesome i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it,positive
that i bought this movie orginally to see david boreanaz naked i am very glad that i did it is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of david s nice tush in the movie if you have ever been a baby sitter in your life you will get a hoot out of this one,positive
great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost didn t finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira s voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie,negative
i loved this movie it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it this did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a tv show that was made into a movie,positive
i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i d just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior,negative
i first viewed this movie on cable that same night i purchased the movie from this seller to date i have had no responses to email no communication what so ever and still have not received this tape in the mail very disappointed and not recommended to purchase from this seller,negative
if you love well written stories great plots and captivating acting then this movie is not for you i don t know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie however there it is it was so boring and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes i had to turn it off i don t even want to know how it ended the cast line up was great that s the only positive comment i can make with regards to this movie do not watch it do not hire it do not believe anybody who thinks it is good the two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly get this it was done in the missionary position avoid this movie,negative
this is probably the worst war related movie i ve ever seen i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two time spent watching this film is time you ll never get back and have nothing to show for it,negative
this was a very interesting movie a friend told me to watch this movie after i told him that i really liked the movie the skeleton key i think i liked the skeleton key better but this was still a really good movie there are a few scenes with nudity in it not a movie for the youngsters we had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end a good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing,positive
my boyfriend and i went to this movie we both hated it it was really pathetic perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people it is pathetic i would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with low self esteem do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this perhaps it is funny but just do not be around one of these people in reality it is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are not all men are virgins like this man but some might as well be because they have no clue about women they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand,negative
francis ford coppola s apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker the art direction editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline acting and inner message the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell or in other words hell is war not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well defined piece of art european filmmakers wouldn t have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film s collaborators through the continuance of the film the plot is fairly simple and brief adapted by joseph conrad s heart of darkness martin sheen plays the role of captain willard a war torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz \( marlon brando \) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks robert duvall s character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself the children walk about the playground oblivious to any danger the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea millions of sprinkle reflect from the water we hear the helicopter s engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack throughout the sequence we hear wagner s ride of the valkyries it is method filmmaking the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing let s not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in stop an innocent upcoming boat suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity this film has its famous moment some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen it doesn t require any intellectual understanding although the film is intellectually remarkable the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against it was a war gone mad like all other wars without purpose or dignity it was a pure act of humanity to destroy and restore their own greedy needs this is a film in which there is no saviour where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed anger foolishness and egoism as coppola once said about the film this film isn t about vietnam this film is vietnam he was right to the date during the current situations of the world where they are trying to protect their own skin the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation it asks for realism enjoy,positive
this version wind and cloud the storm riders made in 2004 is not the same as the storm riders made in 1998 this dvd is a condensed version of a tv series packaged by tai seng it is full screen and was made for tv it is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours most people doing the reviews for this dvd is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring aaron kwok and ekin chen,negative
so what kind of movie is this from the director of i know what you did last summer it s basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set up and similar function deep down venom is just another teen slasher movie they rode into this film with the same clich d scares a young group of teens a psycho killer and a traditional ending so is it worth seeing that i can t completely answer for you if you like more of the same old then it s probably going to be a blast the filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane overused plot i found some parts to be slightly unpredictable and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film the voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply an unstoppable evil force but individually do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece quite frankly in my opinion at least no let s take a look at some of them acting well done well directed too i might add the acting is realistic to a degree and brings us into the film the actors responded \( for the most part \) realistically to the story line and i think that this was set up nicely the major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo lighting dim dark and mysterious the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film combined with the swamp like location i think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful special effects they set this up pretty well a few scenes made me cringe and i felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it or bled them out for it the gore wasn t excessive but just right for a slasher film and props to the director for making that call my only qualm with this is that they used the standard halloween stage blood which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color a few of the actors squirm around in it only to look like they re rolling around in pizza sauce there are a few other tacky special effects including the last major one in the film the killer mr jangles enough said sounds like a dog i ll give the killer credit for being a good actor but the portrayal needed a lot of work the make up kicked it up a notch but the slow motion style jumps and action movie style stunts didn t do it justice the man looked like an athlete and moved like one not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits although i don t specifically know what that looks like i m sure they don t run like football players so what overall it s ok not something i d be dying to see and i m glad that i didn t run to the theatre to catch the first showing it has some good moments and some bad but doesn t really stand out from any normal hollywood production my recommendation it s ok i d rather go rent containment instead the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind it s good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again,negative
this version bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story the book was a simple good story why did they abandon it and the characters so completely the sets and costumes are great but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period i have only watched the first disc but it be a while before i will be able to force myself to watch the others,negative
this product was a bad choice for me it was a poorly done product it was washed out the quality both audio and video was terrible it was not enjoyable to watch the packaging was cheap quality i should have known better pay more and get a nice set and a better product don t try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy paper sleeves make for a cheap copy,negative
this movie has the feel of a late night monster fest hosted by svengoolie or elvira i had no idea what this was about when i started watching it but by the end i wished i would have skipped it entirely the story starts off well with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster \( that you don t see at first \) from there it goes downhill it felt like a low rent pet sematary i have never read the short story that this was based off of but i m sure that king made his scarier than this movie could ever be the best acting in the movie comes from brad dourif best known for his performance as billy bibbit in one flew over the cuckoo s nest and the voice of chucky the killer doll from child s play as an exterminator,negative

paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do with them these key concepts come courtesy of philip k dick via his original short story though the film poorly represents the themes and conceits that have made his stories into unforgettable classics as a thriller paycheck depends upon our identification with its imperiled hero but the movie is never able to make us truly care about ben affleck s michael jennings or his fragile state of mind and that s something dick would have found unforgivable only uma thurman really earns her paycheck here the premise is high concept and the prophetic threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion but paycheck is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes the future world created by john woo isn t nearly as engaging or convincing as say the captivating science fiction setting crafted by stephen spielberg for another high profile dick adaptation minority report for paycheck the comparison is not flattering sadly woo can t even keep himself from forcing his own creative preoccupations into the film and a resulting motorcycle chase sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film s low some scenes are enjoyable and there are fleeting flashes of wit and excitement but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately conceived or placed paycheck isn t a smart film and what s more it sometimes assumes that its audience isn t even paying attention as a result the film never comes close to living up to its potential the material and the audience deserve better unfortunately paycheck is forgettable fare and truly it is without any real payoff brian a dixon revelation magazin,negative
there are just some trilogy s that should not be made and the wild things trilogy is one of them this is not really a trilogy per se since each of the films carries with it the same story with the same twists if you have seen the first you have basically seen each of the sequels except the sequels are both much worse take out the big name actors and make a direct to dvd release and you have wild things diamonds in the rough i am sure you all know the story by now but here is a brief synopsis things get steamy in blue bay florida when marie a 17 year old beauty gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double crossing after meeting the promiscuous elena the new girl at school will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme if you have seen one of the wild things films you have seen them all this film lacks the quality of the original mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come this disc does look great and sounds pretty good but the film takes away from the overall dvd presentation if you want your wild things fix the original version is the one to watch,negative

i have tried for years years to get it i still don t this being the one bergman film i seem never to get around to seeing i made sure i saw it this time a bergman retrospective my local art house theatre well least i sat thru it during the show no less than 5 people got up just walked out so i guess it s not just me i personally found it to be mediocre at best i don t get why folks think this is such an incredible film the storyline is just so banal as are the continuous close ups of faces centered mid screen dated to say the least i don t think it holds up period i have said it before i still believe that if you want to see what bergman was attempting thru out his career go see interiors by woody allen he does bergman better than bergman and don t even get me started on liv ulman ugh,negative
the first was one of the best thrillers ever with clever suspence good characters decent acting and awesome effects this one is meh why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight to video series what s the bloody point now there are some good parts the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent but you know that doesn t even save it this movie is a annoying pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love it is so un intelligent it really makes you wanna puke the characters are nothing but cardboard cut outs i don t even know them well all they do is scream run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut i also really hate the effects in this one as well they felt like they were over used there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was the direction is ok but when it comes to adding wierdness it s too much i don t understand the story there s a strange sex scene which a cube movie does not need cube is about suspence this one is just about adding too much effects a four dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one you don t need that stuff if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first add something original don t take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original but no you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it s a cube movie you don t need nudity overall if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap go ahead i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes if you re a fan of cube dont bother acting 3 10 ugh don t get me started these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die gore factor 4 10 cgi gore come on t a 1 10 a cube movie doesn t need nudity and they don t know that because they don t know cube direction 7 10 andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms but you know i can t say he s a great director he turned the franchise with straight to video written all over it bottom line if you wanna watch go ahead then you ll be sorry this movie is just sad it doesn t try anything to impress you because it s idiotic lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again,negative

i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits smiling laughing joking around man man who reminds me of my doggie hair head i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there but no it was just a 20 second clip i was so disappointed and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety they just weren t funny on a positive note there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet it brought me to tears and the bonus featuring phil s audition was quite interesting but overall i don t recommend it,negative
i found this to be a absurd movie it just has alot of things in it that are just too far fetched and the plot itself wasn t a strong one at that to me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie and it just didn t work it tried to be a movie that all the family could watch and it didn t work it tried to be a disaster movie and it didn t work it tried to be a drama and again it didn t work i got a few chuckles out of it it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that i watched it but it was just sloppy and uneven and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning,negative

at first i was skeptical about buying an aging mccartney band tour dvd even though i have every one so i bought it i watched it from start to finish unbelievably superb the lighting the energy of the band and the crowd suprising interviews and ole paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark after watching it i felt like i had been there it is the best one i have seen yet if you like mccartney this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear excellent buy,positive
both movies are great each one of them has it s own charm ashley judd shows she is a great comedian and hugh jackman is one of the best actors of his generation the movie is soo funny it shows what we women are like when a man breaks up with us and that love is where you least expect it as for brown sugar it s very sweet entertaining and funny to watch i didn t know the actors of this movie and they are amazing perhaps love is next door,positive
this is an excellent film a lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at hbcu s as a matter of fact the issue of lightskinned vs darkskinned is still going on today on a college campus or not spike lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time he is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the african american community i highly recommend this film if you haven t seen it get the dvd it s a classic,positive
this movie ended where tyrese gibson and meagan good meet up again in mexico but heck they are both fugitives hiding from the law how is this a proper happy ending although i will admit meagan good is a fine looking young lady just knowing that she was in this film got me to want to watch it however i don t understand the appeal of these kinds of films violent black gangsta films with lots of foul language gun play and just bad tempered attitudes even that music sounds like it would stir up hatred and provoke violence and harm to anyone just passing by i wish people would get rid of that what are you looking at mentality that just seems to encourage fear to innocent people just passing by my wife is asian and her older sister married an hispanic guy we go to their house every thanksgiving and christmas nothing makes my holidays more depressing than to have to go over to his house and have to watch these violent gangsta movies with his kids i m trying to teach my kids to not have any prejudices of other races but these kinds of films make the black race look bad there wasn t very many positive messages in this movie and if black people are so offended by the use of the n word then why do they keep using it themselves if it s such an offensive term then they need to stop using it themselves these kinds of movies promote and glorify the ugly side of being black in the big city black people need to do more movies with more positive themes we gotta work together if we re going to diminish our black and white prejudices i wish my brother in law would stop having this kind of crap on his tv when i have my children over it s hard to talk to him about it especially when he thinks there is nothing wrong with our kids watching these kinds of films what s more it s hard to reason with someone that has to use the f word in every sentence i m really beginning to struggle with my prejudices within my own family,negative

firstly i must say how much i dislike jennifer lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however i decided to brave it out for the sake of ralph fiennes lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money \( fiennes who is miscast really \) he thinks she is a guest in the hotel she plays along so she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed it comes to a ridiculous ending there s not much else to say to this cinderella movie except maybe that it s not funny lopez isn t a great actress she and fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl,negative
nowadays hollywood just wouldn t have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism unless it was an easy target that doesn t spit back \( aka america and it s 1st amendment \) this film harkens back to the day when people wished our country s foreign policy was a bit more leathery well ya got it now at the very least a film like this would piss off the surrender monkeys in the jackass party not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism but for the villification and slaughter of stalinistic castro like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with makes one wonder if the lefty glenn close now hates herself for acting in such a film what would they say to a film like this unfortunately there s plenty of room for criticism in this movie aside from the political implications therein some \( arguably if not all \) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey \( hence the 4 stars instead of the five \) i think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything it would have to be the 90 s style cgi especially the plane crash at best one might go so far as to say it was cute and what can a guy like me say to that even as i write this review scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al qaida in iraq al zarqawi caught himself a couple of 500 lb bombs with the use of his house for those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized \( not a far stretch from fear mongering right \) in the fight against terrorism this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate america what s worse they can t seem to ban a film exalting american nationalism such as air force one from those who wish to see it \( oh no \) and just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about the passion sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every american and not just the idealistic intellectual few doesn t it,positive
until sam raimi made spider man i think we all regarded tim burton s batman as the best superhero movie \( even though i actually don t consider batman to be a superhero because he has no superpowers \) burton directed this movie and did a great job this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then michael keaton is batman bruce wayne needless to say batman is wayne s alter ego keaton is magnificent at playing the character s alter ego keaton also does a good job playing the character when he s not in costume keaton s bruce wayne isn t as gloomy as christian bale s was in batman begins which isn t necessarily a bad thing but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies but overall bale s bruce wayne is superior to keaton s because bale has a much more developed character to play however keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale the problem with this movie is that the joker \( jack nicholson \) steals the show the whole movie revolves around him so this isn t batman s movie this movie should have been called the joker so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton now you know the thing is the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality and they barely scratch the surface of the character s background we know practically nothing about wayne you d think the guy that s batman wouldn t be so uninteresting but we re bored to tears everytime wayne s onscreen \( and out of costume \) but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes he plays an even more menacing batman than bale so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton but keaton didn t have anything to work with so it s not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak but one of the strengths of keaton s performance is that if you ever met wayne he d seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman that s something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish but thankfully bale was able to do it michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred it s hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years i assumed michael caine s alfred wouldn t compare to gough s but i was wrong they re both great pat hingle was really good \( as commissioner gordon \) in this movie hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series and i enjoyed them both in batman returns but in batman forever i didn t like them nearly as much and in batman robin i found their characters annoying as hell vicki vale s \( kim basinger \) investigation into bruce wayne s background is completely uninteresting but i already knew what she would find out so maybe that s why i didn t like those scenes i also found the vicki character annoying screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen there s lots of little things i love in this movie the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him \( and the terrified expression of the gunmen \) with elfman s dramatic music blaring the look on napier s face when he sees the emptied safe when the guy got fried by the joker s joy buzzer \( one of the worst deaths i ve ever seen in a movie \) when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise and the joker s speech right before a mob boss dies the first action news report of the movie the way urgent is written in messy crayon on the parcel when batman jumps through the skylight \( accompanied by elfman s music \) the design of the batmobile minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave \( again elfman s music is awesome \) the grin on the young jack napier the batmobile attacking the chemical factory the joker s facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd when the bat signal is lit but it s not as awesome as the first time it s lit in batman returns or when it s lit at the end of mask of the phantasm and now a few complaints this movie featured too many songs by prince after a while they get unbearably annoying there were lots of other great 80s pop songs that could have \( and should have \) been used in this movie another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring by the way you can tell that nicholson s make up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking burton s batwing is cooler than schumacher s batwing \( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm \) anyway the targeting system of burton s batwing seems a little screwed up batman has a big red target locked on the joker but the plane s missiles and machine guns miss their target and the joker didn t even try to get out of the way looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems i always overlooked this movie s flaws \( until i saw batman begins \) for two reasons first of all i found keaton s batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie second of all the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is pretty much everytime the joker or the batman aren t onscreen the movie is boring but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie and nastier,positive
i m probably going to invest in a re order of this dvd collection because i simply have worn this one out from the they call it pro football opening to final gun of super bowl x this collection grips your attention and never lets go the writing is superb i especially like nfl 68 and the highlights well it was when pro football was pro football it was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships as was the case with the dallas cowboys of the late 60 s early 70 s next year s champions were the epitome of resiliency the championship chase was a pure joy to view if ever there was a peak in john facenda s narrative career with nfl films this was it though in the alternative i loved his voice overs in super bowls iii iv vii and ix ed and steve sabol really hit the bulleye with blair motion pictures i would have loved to see more afl highlights but that s just nit picking great job,positive
ladies in lavender is a rare gem in the movie world of today this is a soft spoken tale that ignores age and looks to character beautiful roles for older women may be hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two wonderful ladies judi dench and maggie smith take on those roles this movie was adapted from a short story of the same title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played their parts to perfection the movie takes place in a small cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of isolation perhaps isolation from life from emotions and from vulnerabilities the sisters ursula and janet widdington played by dench and smith spend a quiet uninvolved existence venturing out rarely but on one of their walks along the beach that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm a bit befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home to help him recuperate this one act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to unleashing emotions feelings that have been hidden for so many years it is the ability of dench and smith to portray these emotions these feelings for the camera that make this movie sing and the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the supporting roles played by daniel bruhl and natascha mcelhone together these actors make this move work on several levels to give the viewer a splendid evening s entertainment,positive

i had heard a lot about how funny margaret cho was and finally got a chance to watch her video i find her way overrated she does have some funny stuff she s got a particular knack for doing impressions and there s some other genuinely funny material however the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience she does a lot of vulgar material homosexual oriented jokes etc that are clearly just there for the outlaw value and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she s personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base it s just not funny,negative
this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie s fans live the life nowhere close to cher s and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she s supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she s like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out,negative

based on a true story and a book called evidence of love this tv movie is made remarkable by the emmy winning performance of barbara hershey she is utterly magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally murders her ex lover s wife in a self defensive rage hershey superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman who commits a heinous deed her hypnosis sequence is brutally painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage brian dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her out of her terrifying predicament the movie is impressively done and once again worthy most of all for ms hershey s dynamic presence,positive
eraserhead is filled with strange uncanny scenes what is it to be uncanny dictionary com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis beyond the ordinary or normal mysterious arousing superstitious fear or dread uncomfortably strange i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere the movie does not have a linear logical storyline it is a mood piece for want of a better term a visual poem which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen if you let your mind play among these images it will begin to invent meaning for itself you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it the cinematography is stunning not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term but arresting you simply cannot turn your head away will you like it well i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate think of it as a rorshach how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are,positive
i was so disappointed in this film the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting i love terrance he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis tennessee in this day and time and did terrance howard give ludacris character a cassette tape to listen to not a cd a tape i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too and the hook to that song you know it s hard out here for a pimp ya think with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed don t get me wrong i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don t quite bring it do we the cookout how high girl 6 woo kingdom come now we can add hustle and flow to the list i m glad terrance howard redeemed himself in crash do yourself a favor and pass on this one,negative
george clooney and quentin tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time it s sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys this whole flick is akin to getting a gift wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper problem is as is often the case with tarantino and robert rodriguez ain t nothin inside the package get it these guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever the word shallow comes to mind there is nothing there and i doubt that there ever will be however having said that i must give credit where credit is due juliette lewis the talented juliette lewis is terrific as usual good to see harvey keitel do his thing same goes for fred williamson the rarely seen michael parks \( this guy by the way made some terrific country type records back in the 60 s and we wish he d do more he s up there with merle haggard in my humble opinion \) and last but not least the beautiful salma hayek is also in this although she hardly does enough she still had the curves back then in addition to the above we could have done without all the obvious and crappy cgi effects at the end the stuff just doesn t work never did by the way the documentary full tilt boogie is way better than the main feature,negative

i m not sure what compelled me to seek out americano written and directed by kevin noland it s not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson a star of tv s dawson s creek perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper s inclusion in such a small scale production i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar here however the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film maybe it was international star leonor varela a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america most likely though it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain with great scenery bull fights hemingway hard drinking and partying the running of the bulls the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing however i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works the film is photographed well and has good performances my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming of age story with an astounding lack of real character insight this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat the setup is simple as recent college graduates jackson and two pals \( who bicker comically \) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the real world and a new job facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood work and independence freedom and monotony dreams and reality jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure should he stay in spain these are legitimate questions and a legitimate albeit familiar story path what makes americano so tedious and uninvolving however is that the film doesn t allow you to know its characters a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off and americano doesn t succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation we never know anything about jackson s job or life in america or his dreams passions interests etc aside from this fleeting romance sure the film goes through the requisite motions jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway what else would you expect in spain if he has artistic aspirations however the screenplay surely never develops this lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life i simply fell into the camp of who cares there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture dennis hopper s role however as a club host is a complete misfire ultimately though my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth sure jackson s at a crossroads but lacking any understanding of what he wants it made no difference to me what he chose sorry but that s a big problem when it is your film s central theme kgharris 02 07,negative

2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn t require you to have seen the original i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out and having never seen the original i thought i would be lost and wouldn t enjoy myself as much as other people but on the contrary i left the experience much happier than when i came in this film is full of quick one liners that deserve a laugh the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open i have heard and read that people didn t appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races but overall i think the balance works well even thinking of the plot that we are left with i really can t see another time when a race would even be appropriate and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original i would have to disagree why frankly i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor \( i mean c mon have you seen the pacifier \) he s nothing more than a meat head who while able to do pretty good fight scenes should leave the dialogue to someone else yes this film is for the younger crowd and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place \( take the boat jumping as an example \) but there is no saying that an older person wouldn t enjoy it as well the only thing that i will say is that you really shouldn t go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance or else you will be disappointed if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is however you will thoroughly enjoy yourself,positive

i have been a long time radiohead fan and like many others have been waiting patiently for a live dvd so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old i couldn t help being disappointed when i watched this dvd the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch in fact i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime i ve always that radiohead was modern progressive and totally innovative i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey and it doesn t help that before every song thom mutters this is a new one,negative

how good is angelina jolie in this film it is a testament to this young actor s presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is there is not a frame in this film that doesn t feel her infection winona rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused \( or is it enlightened \) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche the interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless one look into angelina jolie s eyes and you will see the warm jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they ve tempted your own tired efforts even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl s decent into psychological insecurity it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced james mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil no melodrama no over the top sentimentality just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives if you ve ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life this film is certain to trigger old fears but it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be this film deserves that second look as well as its painful salvation a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend it is a heavy drama so be forewarned and a very moving drama at that,positive

with the 70 million that was spent on the 2005 video game inspired film doom you d think that director andrzej bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly on second thought given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of shoot the mutants it s pretty clear that mr bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment as to the film s plot it can be summarized in a single sentence a group of ber soldiers lead by their sarge \( played by the rock \) travel to mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh eating mutants after injecting a criminal with dna recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a martian archaeological dig so there s tons of shooting a lot of screams gallons of fake blood guts being tossed about a martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small scale version of the sphere others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include karl urban \( ber soldier john grimm \) and rosamund pike \( as john grimm s sister named sam \) why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in doom defies logic to anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1 star film in a theater you have my deepest sympathy to anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of doom on dvd please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price that alone should tell you how good this film is,negative

bob crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series hogan s heroes however while he was enjoying the life of a tv star he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life sexual promiscuity and deviance auto focus tells the story of bob crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess when the film opens bob \( greg kinnear in a fantastic performance \) is about to hit the big time and is a loving family man who doesn t drink or smoke he attends mass on sundays one day on the set of hogan s heroes though his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets john carpenter \( willem dafoe \) a techno guy with all the latest gadgets including video equipment which fascinates crane carp opens the door for bob to unleash his inner desires which both excite and frighten him it begins innocently enough sitting in on the drums at a strip club but eventually bob loses all self control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently swinging all the while bob refuses to admit that there s anything wrong with him if you ask him he ll tell you he s just a normal guy after hogan s heroes came to an end crane took a job with a dinner theatre show which allowed crane and carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show as crane s indiscretions get worse his personal life deteriorates as he divorces two wives \( played by rita wilson and mario bello \) auto focus has been expertly directed by paul schrader who begins the film with bright glossy colors then as crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable just as crane does kinnear gives the performance of his life showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his life,positive
i mean that statement in two ways first in my humble opinion this is martin scorcese at his finest this is better than goodfellas by a wide margin all of the regulars give awesome performances in this \( even sharon stone who i can t stand \) if you like mafia pictures this is the best one to own i also mean that it s a great picture due to the fact that it s on hd dvd the picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of las vegas really jump out of the television it s almost 3 d the extras are ample but i d say adequate that s the reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 there is the obligitory commentary deleted scenes and a couple featurettes it s all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae i do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running this and batman begins are the reasons you should own an hd dvd player note i have the hd dvd drive attached to my xbox 360 and it works brilliantly,positive
when was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie you actually paid your own money to see it last night pasedena the bicycle thief it s an art movie it doesn t count we re talking about movie movies robert altman is one of my favorite directors mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases this short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context with this dialog the player reveals exactly why hollywood movies don t make the money they should not because they don t make quality films but because when a good movie does make money it doesn t count because it s not a movie movie if he stopped to really listen to what was being said he would ve seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don t cost much to make but people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering wait there s more the people in the room don t know it but producer griffin mill in a fit of paranoia killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night he was being stalked by a writer but he blamed \( and murdered \) the wrong one now he s still being stalked still in danger of losing his job and the cops suspect him of murder not a good week for mister mill as the conversation presses on mill s potential replacement passes around a newspaper telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts mill spots the story on his murder which we re already watching play out in a movie yes it s that type of movie the self referential hollywood movie about hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers enjoyment we ve seen it about a thousand times before \( or since \) get shorty adaptation wes craven s new nightmare even certain elements of 8 1 2 there s really nothing too special about it but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable pay close attention to the ending scene and think about what words they re using opposed to what they re really saying there s really only one word for a film like this clever,positive
having only seen seinfeld s series on tv that goes by the same name it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on dvd i d never seen the dvd before but some of the material sounded familiar perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the seinfeld show you may notice that in his speel about the chinese he lets the word shovel out too soon \( when talking about the chinese s perseverance with chopsticks \) and thus spoils the joke a little bit but seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib so he managed to work around it a thoroughly recommendable dvd,positive

this movie creeped me out and not in a good way johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross maybe it s the michael jackson ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face could they have picked a more horrible look for ww it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 wig and 5 clown makup on him i love tim burton s other movies but this one sucked bigtime it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from this movie is childish if you re an adult and pales compared to the original if you re a kid it s way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking auntie zoe what does that mean when are screenwriters going to figure it out either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie it s really hard to do both in the same film it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids they end up appealing to nobody maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing it s amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton if you are not a fan of either don t waste your time with this steaming pile of poo,negative
the direction was a grade acting top class and to top it you had eric and clint eastwood eric fleming was mindblowing one has yet to come across an actor with his confidence class and authority yes i agree we always tend to focus on clint forgetting that it was eric who was mile ahead of him todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western yes the fact is without rawhide there would be no clint eastwood,positive
if the girls in this film were considered hot back in 1979 then i m glad i was still in preschool some unattractive women not college age girls but actual 30 year old women who cannot get into the popular pi sorority start their own sorority called h o t s which stands for help out the seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie the goal of the h o t s girls is to steal all the guys away from pi house so they throw wild parties jump topless out of a airplane \( too bad the camera was on the ground \) fly a hot air balloon over the pi house to launch pies on the pi girls as they sunbathe topless etc the script seems to have been written by a 12 year old which isn t a bad thing i liked the fast paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice unfortunately i didn t find any of the girls even remotely attractive if this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with nikki ziering brittany daniel shannon elizabeth and jenna jameson as the four main h o t s girls and maybe catherine bell as the house mom it would gross over 800 million in dvd sales i also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots how rude,negative
bad bad bad bad acting bad writing bad directing i was sort of neutral about dicaprio until i saw this steaming pile of bad acting consequently since seeing this i haven t voluntarily watched another dicaprio performance it was a huge mistake by the director \( or the screen writer \) to not set this in the era in which jim carroll grew up or if it was meant to be it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms,negative
watching this movie is a very bizarre experience having attended high school in the countryside close to large clusters of amish farms i had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing amish teenagers i dismissed most of them as rumor this movie confirmed that those wild stories i heard were probably true a very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most americans cannot even begin to comprehend worth a rental at the very least,positive

spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health eat nothing but mcdonald s fast food for 30 days the result his health gets ruined while spurlock s experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health i rarely eat mcdonalds \( though i enjoy the odd coke \) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia as it is worldwide the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food and made ray kroc \( its founder \) a fortune i don t really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil because they are multinational corporations we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers as well as shareholders we happily buy coke mcdonalds cigarettes and many other things obviously bad for our health and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad in our individualistic culture we tend to all too readily avoid self responsibility and the virtue of self control and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists however the rocketing levels of obesity especially amoung children are of great concern and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents spurlock s experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously and not ignoring them for the sake of self indulgence,positive
how did he have the time to write such a picture to co direct it to act in it and after everything else to write its score noel coward s energies always remarkable were redoubled during the second world war and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing in which we serve is still worth watching but it s nowhere as appealing as either cavalcade or this happy breed and its focus on the life and death of a ship \( the hms torrin \) is strangely monomaniacal almost constructivist over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away symbols of brute strength like something from a soviet film the ship goes up the ship goes down a new ship rises out of the water and in between coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat till our interest settles on three bernard miles as hardy with his striking long hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it he should have played ichabod crane john mills as blake a tiny little pipsqueak who s feisty in the standard mickey rooney jimmy cagney manner and noel coward himself as captain kinross tranquil with class privilege and in the background his glamorous marriage to the ineffable celia johnson \( so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums \) hitchcok s lifeboat had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical but without coward s complicated flashback structure coward stalwarts joyce carey and kay walsh show up as the love interests for miles and mills respectively carey in this movie and in brief encounter as well treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth nor good looking in any way who s given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest she must have kissed the ground every time noel coward walked on it who else would have written such roles for her the movie is trying indeed when it goes serious and yet that s half the fun of it seeing how often coward plays the race card we are an island race indeed i teared up of course i did during the blitz as the v 1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on london households leading to the death of several favorite characters and again when coward leads his naval boys into dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half nude british soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of kool aid outside of these scenes however the movie is marred by its agitprop and by david lean s tiresomeness in showing everything at such a glacial pace ps the film was shot by ronald neame who later became a director himself and whose masterpiece the poseidon adventure sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of in which we serve,positive
othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times in the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done the story of othello is that of a venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman the general happens to be black in an effort to sabotage the general iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death while shakespeare gives motivations for his characters interpretations and emphases tend to vary kenneth brannagh s production of othello emphasies iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so this production with ian mckellan in the role of iago puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in being bad wheras the latter seems more inclined to get even both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure the role of desdemona is portrayed in this version by imogen stubb and she is a delight to watch she bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic so too is the title role played admirably the problem with othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence this is a fine performance all around with a difficult play if you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check it is well worth the time,positive
while it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers this history of rock simply doesn t jell as a whole by trying to explain the evolution of the music the pleasure gets lost along the way if you are a rock connaisseur you won t learn many new things if you watch this what you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field \( ex motown or british invasion \) as it is it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like emerson lake and palmer and king crimson among others it costs me 80 dollars \( canadian money \) for this 5 dvd set which is too much for what it s worth rent it and enjoy the clips,positive
i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today the message is still clear those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie this is certainly one of burt lancaster s better roles and he plays it with much guesto if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background this movie has a strong message don t listen to the word of god from others if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible do so in your own way do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money even in this modern day and age the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong mr bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek re election everyone who is a born again christian or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty \( if there is one \) still a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today,positive

not a fan of graphic novels or cgi i was fully prepared to dislike this movie but found it to be so well written cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection it s a dark movie subversive really but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people that one strong person with a will determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them can turn the tide it s a powerful message and it s beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery symbolism and script bravo,positive

made in 1959 douglas sirk s imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago it s a real cinematic treat shameless tearjerker and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one s teenagers in this case daughters are growing up and preparing to enter the world lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom together with her young daughter susie they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand to mouth existence their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams one day at coney island lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane who is being taken care of by a black woman annie johnson \( juanita moore \) whom lora mistakes for the maid when told by her that she s the mother the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment lora is initially hesitant not because of annie s race but because she s struggling and doesn t have any money to pay her a wage eventually however she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night at the same time lora meets the extremely fine looking wannabe photographer steve archer \( john gavin \) steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage meanwhile the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress yet neglects her growing daughter in the process steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization but has trouble relating to lora s need to be independent and famous annie s heart is eventually broken gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success the contrast of the mother s compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story s ultimate paradox lora annie steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn t seem to be doing them much good they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them lora gets her career but she s unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother whilst sara jane perhaps the most damaged character achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother under douglas sirk s accomplished direction miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life especially lana s gorgeous outfits yet the film clocking in at over two hours is always compelling and is never boring the screenplay is sophisticated the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film the brilliant surfaces audacious colors and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy entrapment and emotional anxiety and where the price of following one s dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost mike leonard june 06,positive

as a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed city of the living dead and zombie i was very disappointed with house by the cemetery fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two thirds of the movie only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes house by the cemetery is about an researcher \( whose work is never specified \) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress the titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment so dr boyle his wife lucy and their son bob move in despite a lot of bad signs like the boarded up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a dr jacob tess freudstein in the front hall bob has little red headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is \( though no one else sees her \) furthermore people keep claiming dr boyle has been in town before with a non existent daughter \( which he denies not totally convincingly \) he also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter anne who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night and lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues got that good because half of that stuff never gets explained the only things that get worked out are the little red headed girl s identity and the identity of the killer \( neither of which are that hard to figure out \) there are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film \( the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand the photograph that changes with each viewing a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding \) but fulci s ability to handle the gore moments disappoints he lingers too long over some deaths makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter s head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary compared to the injury to the eye scene in zombie or christopher george chopping through the coffin in cotld dr boyle s chopping through the door around his son s head feels like self parody fulci s other films have incoherent plots but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot \( the dream like nature of city of the living dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat \) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic house by the cemetery has neither thing working in its favor it s not hell of the living dead level bad but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting \( especially paolo malco who plays dr boyle \) and an interesting set up almost make the flaws worse also this version has a never before seen deleted scene but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack,negative
this movie is all about entertaining the combination between die hard and typical martial arts flick works in many levels but the production values are hong kong s don t miss that point fans of jet li are welcome but action fans be careful here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames exploding building models chopped off dummies you name it the characters are extreme in their own context jet li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor loyal gentleman honorable deadly you know a portrait of the typical good guy the bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking he doesn t fight or kick much in this film but he shoots a lot dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator that happens to be be the right size well you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes but if you are into hong kong low production values action films you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the 90 s by the way this dvd edition sucks english dubbed subtitles poor sound and no extras not even a filmography,positive

after watching spirited away i was excited to watch other movies by the same director unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic it s bad to hate message what the creators of princess mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive disgusting things of the world yes hate can become overly consuming just as any other emotion can overcome us or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one s \( just as loving that which is evil wouldn t be a good thing \) but placed in its proper context at the proper time at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems and the people who claim that hate is all evil themselves hate the haters which i find comical the movie also has strong pro feminist anti man messages i wanted to like this film but i don t appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense,negative

vci s budget dvd starts out well enough for the obscure thriller lady ice with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come unfortunately as soon as the credits end the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs i ve ever seen on dvd pass on this one from vci and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits,negative
daniel day lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world he looks like a different person in almost every film he makes i assume that s the real day lewis in this flick about the rebellion in northern ireland revenge and absolution his romantic interest emily watson puts in a good performance too day lewis looks a lot different than he did in gangs of new york the unbearable lightness of being my left foot and last of the mohicans but he is just as compelling in his performance i thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat hollywood finale but otherwise i enjoyed it if you like substantial filmmaking good acting great drama unfamiliar vistas and a good story you ll enjoy it too,positive
hard to believe it took me until now \( february 2007 \) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award deserving back in the early 80 s i loved this movie it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting especially tony montana a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is \( over 2 hours \) everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime it won t disappoint the ending gave me goosebumps it was that good and intense watch it now,positive
expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick slapstick comedy overly melodramatic subplotting and on occasion even a hint of a story all that aside \( which is how i am sure the director saw it \) the balletic intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat jet li s utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance nothing like his forgettable hollywood yawns the subtitles for this mandarin language effort are a bit difficult to read since the english is in small print below the more prominent chinese subtitles but when the action kicks into gear forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes notably notable in the three installments part i a mind blowing hook and ladder battle plus a terrific umbrella sequence part ii the climactic fight with donnie yen the speed and technique shown during the double pole fight is staggering yen s moves with his cloth staff left me gob smacked part iii this one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable the final fight scene at the lion dance competition is a colorful pageant but lacks the impact of the one on one fights in the first two films mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks all in all can t go wong with this purchase,positive

the firms super body sculpt is a 40 mins 3 parts workout which is broken up into upper body lower body and abs each segment has its own warmup and cool down it can be performed one segment at a time or all together for a complete total body workout the upper body flies by quickly with pushups lat rows and french presses and biceps the lower body section focuses a little too much on squats and by the end of your last leg press exercise there are more squats that will make you want to scream enough i found the abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches and too much on obliques the stablization exercises are a great bonus to this dvd and are my favourite overall it is very well instructed you can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough especcially during leg presses and squats i usually do all three segments to get the full benefits i need and this dvd is great as a beginners tool to a firm body,positive

i love me some mamet his dialogue takes some getting used to since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm i also love his dedication to his actors employing the same ones over and over so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe which may very well be his point however edmond is the first mamet film to leave me disappointed and worse annoyed macy plays edmond with typical wide eyed aplomb edmond is a man who is weak but is valiantly \( if not clumsily \) trying to be strong the movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film edmond then goes home breaks up with his wife and goes on a deaf dumb and blind search for himself finding instead over priced whores pimps who are not what they seem and generally everything but himself i get the point edmond is the epitome of modern man s emasculation unable to find his own balls with both hands and his tawdry and panicked search through new york for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go \( man or woman \) to find if not redemption then the places where one belongs there are a lot of problems here most superficially there s one of packaging the dvd box prominently features a picture of a gun and no gun appears in the film the tags on the box call the film alternately a mystery and a fast paced thriller when it is neither one of those things not even close this movie is \( like most of mamet s work \) based on a play never before has it been more obvious \( unless you count the absolutely brilliant oleanna \) edmond is essentially a one man show with macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters \( some of them played well denise richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker and some of them not so well julia stiles seems over medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress \) in spite of how they do and don t help edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself most of these characters seem disposable making the movie come across as equally dismissable \( i would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about rebecca pidgeon mamet s wife an actress who appears i think in every single one of her husband s films this woman is viewed in even the nicest of lights one of the worst actresses i ve ever seen and she sucks the life out of every scene she s in in this movie she plays edmond s wife and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence it s nice that mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does but one has to wonder if she d ever get any acting work at all if she weren t married to such a famous writer director \) at the risk of spoiling the film i will say that at the end edmond finally does find where he belongs a place that given his previous struggles makes a lot of sense \( although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers \) but this is small consolation since by this time few people are likely to have any sympathy for edmond or where he ends up his character s slap dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate fear destiny and \( ironically \) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience a few good performances and some nice visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along avoid this flick try oleanna or glen gary glenross instead,negative

joe versus the volcano is a rare blend of comedy and insight that s romantic enough for girls funny enough for guys with effective visual symbolism and appropriate for the whole family maybe it could be described as an allegory for escaping the drudgery of life or something like that but at any rate it s pleasant to watch at times profound at other times funny the beginning 3rd is about joe \( tom hanks \) struggling with hypochondria and a lousy really crummy job primarily because of the dreary work environment and the typical \( oppressive \) supervisor \( dan hedaya \) \( i ve been there myself when i worked at pines mfg h h tooling and again at toro where everyone was on dope \) joe learns from his doctor \( robert stack of the untouchables \) that he has a brain cloud and only a few months to live the tone of the movie rises as joe quits his job and we feel like impending death is the best thing that s ever happened to him he takes a former co worker \( meg ryan \) to dinner and seems to wake up to life for the first time the next day billionaire lloyd bridges \( airplane \) enters joe s life with a bizarre proposition since he s dying anyway why not literally jump into a volcano for the billionaire s own financial motive and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the meantime joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur ossie davis \( the client \) and the billionaire s two daughters both played by meg ryan \( sleepless in seattle \) which makes a total of 3 roles for her in this great movie making it even more pleasant to watch,positive

whether william golding deserved nobel prize or not is still a debatable point but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book and its name is lord of the flies but let s not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while because after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi layered world of words onto the screen even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that you can interpret the meaning of lord of the flies but who can really visualize it or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter the biggest problem of harry hook s new version is not the changes done to the film the boys are american military school cadets using dirty words frequently but those parts didn t annoy me much real problem is something more essential to the film which is storytelling in short the 1990 film doesn t know what it wants to be on the film s video cover you can read \( and i quote \) this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul well not exactly for as adventure story it lacks pace the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer and piggy s role should be more than that of a whining fat boy and don t forget simon who sees things it is true but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne s adventure stories by watching this film you can follow the story of the book but find no tension or thought provoking words in it balthazar getty s feature film debut and lewis m allen one of the producers of the film had also produced peter brook version in 1963,negative

this disk collects the two tales from the crypt movies on one side of a single disk for some reason the menu has the second movie listed first in the first movie billy zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the demons can retake the universe this is the story of his battle with the current demon knight the protector of the key wonderfully crafted and dark the second movie bordello of blood is a more tongue in cheek t a fest and lacks the dark seriousness of the first lilith the queen of all vampires has been awakened she can be controlled by a key \( the one from the first movie \) she has set up a bordello to lure victims to her hunger dennis miller is his wise cracking self as he portrays a down and out private investigator looking for a missing person it is nice not to have to flip the disk over or insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras \( we do get the original trailers \) seeing the two films together really showcases the extreme difference between the two the first is dark well written and well acted the second is gratuitous crass and just not quite as good \( although it is fun in its own way \) now they are together at a reasonable price,positive

phantom quest corp an action comedy film about the drunken karoake singing party girl ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies from dracula to a possessed surgeon mummies and even magical monks this movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events the only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times the series is too short although it was still good the video quality was also pretty nice and subtitles were understandable and on que the plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks but more action and laughs all in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent a great addition to any anime collection,positive

sorry but this movie blew the premise was there but the delivery just sucked i can only take the suspension of belief so far we are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf \( whom he s been w for at least a year \) about his last one before that and gf before that at least two of them have his home phone number they ve never called she s never seen the caller id she s never answered the phone give me a break then she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms she meets up with joyce \( the most recent \) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes and starts believing that the bf should really be with her joyce is none the wiser but if you ask me joyce had stalker qualities b c she harassed him when he was with the model calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone keeps that stupid boomerang in a frame etc this chick stacy \( brittany m \) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going holly hunter s character is precisely why i have more male friends than female stacy just met this woman and she s revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie i never expected the big climax but i did ask myself several times will this barb \( hh \) chick back the off on to the climax it was actually a surprise but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for stacy after she humiliated all those people i never got the impression that the bf \( derrick \) was cheating on her yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different the only reason he pissed me off was because he didn t read stacy the riot act in the end this movie tries to wax philosophical and you just end up hating all of the characters except for the dog a very passible movie i wouldn t even bother,negative

one could review kingdom of heaven on a lot of levels as an action packed medieval adventure romance as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors or as a statement about humanity s less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn t lead to warfare with people of differing points of view i was expecting mostly the first two and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third my favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling i ve had about spirituality for some time now god will understand my lord and if he doesn t then he is not god and we need not worry why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not i don t know and when i heard these words coming from the screen i realized someone out there understands we don t find god in books or doctrine or sermons we know god in our hearts or not at all this character looked to his heart and knew god will understand and anyone who doesn t is surely not god no matter what someone else might claim and if you loved the movie you ll enjoy this dvd it s a classy widescreen handling of a film that s visually rich and deserves to be seen in it s cinematic format with gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming i can t imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form,positive
i didn t give this five stars because it s some kind of oscar worthy achievement but if you are a fan of the quirky b grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties then this film is a must hawk offers hilarious jump cut editing dialogue that is spectacular in its badness and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film for all that the film is also remarkable for its innocence in a time when cheesecake t a fantasy like the sword and the sorceress and the infamous deathstalker series were the norm hawk the slayer keeps it clean and is all the funnier for it if you have the right sort of friends then snap this gem up invite them over for beer and pizza and have a go it s more than worth it,positive

zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on mafia and on this tour its really hard to take and i m glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on shot to hell bls are a great group but zakk s persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles blessed hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the cds stoned and drunk and funeral bell are critically altered to the point where i had to skip them i m actually starting to suspect that zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect because i can t imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way a few tunes sung this way i can handle buts its total overkill on this dvd the behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because zakk is a funny guy,negative
if you have not read the book then this movie may intrigue you it is quirky and interesting to say the least as a storyline it does not lack imagination from maine to vienna to nyc and back to maine from the jew hating german tourists to the radicals and the from one hotel new hampshire to another the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events and life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams now in relation to the actual book this movie can be described with just one word rushed the adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything all characters and all events thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family i could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily how the scenes lack emotional depth how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed but i will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short if the book was a long wave like function with a rise to a crest then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest over and over and over again then the movie was just a cross section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave like function shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender where they were shaken and served to please god knows what surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone and it was not for lack of effort it was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes a mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation either that or a more free flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the 120 minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture thank god for jodie foster s and beau bridges s performances who bring fanny and win berry to life keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience as far as this movie is concerned just toss it out as far as you can and if you are to keep it then do so to remind yourselves of how to not adapt a great book onto the screen this is the only reason why i keep mine,negative
standard disclaimer i love dream theater however this dvd is almost unbearable to watch due to all of the video effects that obscure the live performance didn t i buy a dvd of dream theater live so that i could see them play at times several minutes pass without showing the musicians as they re playing video effects such as swirling colors images of the artists upside down \( \) and black and white re enactments make the whole affair feel like someone was trying to create their first music video for mtv in 1984 or maybe trying to induce an epileptic seizure in the viewer dream theater would get a rating of 1000 but i d give this dvd a 0 if i could just goes to show what poor editing gets you,negative

so i decided maybe i ll give this exploitation thing a try considering i love gore violence and horror movies the reason i give it a 1 star is because it just isn t that good of a movie it s very boring for most of the movie about the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said then the guys just rape this woman several times then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge it s very slow paced and doesn t live up to the hype it isn t all that gory and it isn t scary either also the rape isn t that convincing i m not saying i need everything shown in detail but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal oh and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her and he was practically mentally retarded the guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad that is not grounds for what she did to him which in my opinion was the worst of the killings anyways not that good of a movie don t let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not,negative
season 1 of veronica mars took me by surprise and i really enjoyed the ride the second season however doesn t live up to the quality of the first instead of one large mystery in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve there s nothing wrong with that approach but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved another would pop right up without any resolution for the first many episodes ended with my friends and i turning to one another and asking is that it where s the rest of it this happened quite a bunch with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist that s totally out of character yet we never see that family the abused girl or hear about the incident again that type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up the major villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable because of the all the loose ends go nowhere plots and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline i m giving season 2 a 2 star rating season 2 of veronica mars still has some funny dialogue and some clever episodes but it doesn t deserve all the 4 and 5 star reviews i ve seen i ll continue to watch however as veronica mars has a lot of promise hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season 3,negative
after seeing both peyton place and the sequel i can tell you that i could tolerate the recast carol lynley and tuesday weld were wonderful in their perspective parts but i have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well my reasons for asking the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie over and over in this film it is stated that selena was raped when she was thirteen yet in the original film selena alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school also she looked pretty mature for thirteen then there s selen as boyfriend \( whose name escapes me at the moment \) in the original film he stood by her through the murder charges the revelation of the rape and the miscarriage yet in the sequel i m suppose to buy that he couldn t handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of selena yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast i have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door it was all too obvious that the original film wasn t taken into account when writing the sequel not credible at all,negative
i just finished watching callie and son i got my copy from the dollar store and it has another movie \( power passion and murder \) with michelle pfeiffer in it as well it really wasn t that bad considering the price i paid lindsay wagner is actually the main character and i think she did a great job as did most of the actors in this film the only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to with a bit of editing and a bit better script it would have been a great movie the end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying i d recommend it for someone to watch once but i wouldn t pay more than i did for it the dvd quality is really poor the sound fades in and out but for what it was a bargain bin cheapy i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it,positive
i was thrilled to find this set here on amazon and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly all of the dvd s have some good interviews with the producers designers voice actors and other people associated with the show i don t usually like watching interviews things where people talk a lot but i love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was i totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different,positive

i am convinced you have to be one of three things to enjoy this film male born before 1935 or a huge monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out marilyn is so annoying in this i wanted to smack her and tom ewell s character is equally a jerk i am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny is adultery funny not really i don t mean to sound so conservative in fact i m quite the opposite i m pretty liberal which may be why this movie bothered me so much it is very sexist and dated and monroe s usual portray of the harmless stupid breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn t very empowering to young women the character she portrays has no name is simply titled the girl a female puppet manufactured for pleasure the jokes are dated and fall flat no longer funny to modern society i think the seven year itch is one of the most overrated classics ever but what can i say my 84 year old grandmother enjoyed it maybe she was just nostalgic for the 50s a much better monroe comedy is some like it hot where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day,negative
although tomorrow is yesterday is an okay episode it is not one to rave about it is certainly not one of the original series best however return of the archons is one of the best and one of my favourites kirk spock and mccoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions a mob attacks kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers it seems the planet is run by a man named landru who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get absorbed a kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity later it is discovered that landru is a computor projection the edict of landru who died 5 000 years ago has been continued by a computer i just read a review saying the solution to the landru mystery won t surprise anyone it sure surprised me i didn t see that one coming,positive

truly frightening gruesome a gore fest a bloodbath and it has a plot really there are a lot of clich expressions to describe this movie but they re all true it s a horror movie in the true sense of the word i hadn t seen a rob zombie movie before this one but i would have to say after seeing it that it s got to be his masterpiece i don t see how he could top it house of 1000 corpses is not a movie that people who don t like the genre should be watching i don t think they d be able to stomach it it s a downward spiral of evil depredation degradation and mayhem out of an imagination that must be really sick \( but awesome \) the sense of humor in the movie actually doesn t spoil it it just makes it better it s so malicious the atmosphere the acting the special effects and makeup everything contributes to an hour and a half long ride through a freak show that shouldn t be missed by true horror movie buffs buy it rent it whatever if you love being scared you ll love this movie it delivers,positive
i also found this best of collection to fall very short of the best there are clearly many other episodes they could have and should have used and included to make this truly a best of feature the few cases they did showcase were by far not the scariest a definite disappointment though still a fan,negative

what a disappointment i absolutely loved the black pearl but was admittedly nervous about a sequel as it turned out i had every reason to be it whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original major or minor who seemed interesting that they did but unfortunately the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while keira must have somehow pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie legolas i mean orlando bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along sometimes good but more often haphazardly to my mind the only real interesting addition was that of davey jones except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying \( due to the tentacles n all \) at least his was a unique addition to the movie i do sort of object however to associating him with the flying dutchman legend the two have nothing to do with each other fantasy or not and don t get me started on the cannibals any way i think this movie merits the two y ars i gave it while considerably beneath that first movie it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times but it is most definitely not as good and as a final thought the very last scene of the movie lose it entirely it simply was unnecessary,negative

scratching deeper beyond the surface one can find return of the seven to be significantly different from its predecessor the magnificent seven it is much more than a thematically framed sequel which it can easily be mistaken for return of the seven is a dark film and it does not offer the hope of a truly optimistic future for any of its characters in this respect it is a complete inversion of the magnificent seven through their catharsis in the original we saw an attempt at redemption through an act of nobility on the part of the seven they truly were noble and i believe were redeemed for their transgressions as gunmen some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not that film had to end as it did with the seven ultimately all committed to their singular code of ethics and morality in an emotionally charged finale in this film there is very little emotion on the surface instead director burt kennedy gives us a thought provoking study into the human psyche and the very nature of defeatism of the human spirit in this film there are no pretensions on the part of the seven for most of them this is just another gun job there are no higher aspirations that they are cognizant of if it were not this job it would be the next to tell his story burt kennedy focuses almost entirely on the character of chris the leader perfectly portrayed again by yul brynner this is not really a tale of the seven instead kennedy uses brynner with all his aplomb and apparent stoicism to curiously examine and probe the motivations of the other six lorca the villain \( pompously played by mexican director emilio fernandez \) and several other key characters in effect kennedy takes what was apparently a happy or satisfactory ending from the magnificent seven and asks what if what if 10 years later the remaining characters are not so contented as prior events led us to believe they would be would friends be willing go up against innumerable odds would strangers once again sign on to go up against those same innumerable odds do the strong still have to help the weak and who really are the strong and the weak when 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away chico \( julian mateos \) and other mexican farmers from surrounding villages chris and vin \( robert fuller \) agree to come to his aid however it is chris alone that recruits the members of the seven this time out kennedy singularly endows chris a sense of morality and level headedness in this film that comes from his wisdom and manner of nobility in effect this is brynner s film all the way just as john sturges directorial style was so smooth that his own storytelling glossed right over the depth and complexity of his own work so is burt kennedy s however kennedy is challenged with a very dark and brooding tale to tell where sturges the magnificent seven could easily have been taken on a purely action film level and still been successful kennedy does not have that luxury kennedy has to deliver an action film built on previous events and he also has to approach the story from a different perspective to remain fresh yet keep it thematically to the concept of the original seven not an easy task if the viewer does not look deeply into this film it may just appear as a well produced dud however i believe kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations the more times i view this film again it comes back to brynner he makes members of the seven \( vin chico and colbee \) all come to realizations about themselves with his subtle yet profound dialogue he gives riker and luis a chance at redemption even though both men come from total opposites of the spectrum he helps the failed priest rise from his failures at least as far as his knees chris even gives lorca the villain a chance to ride out because when chris was younger he gave him the same chance however chris refuses to let lorca now bathe his personal grief as an ineffectual father in other men s blood yet even lorca is literally redeemed by the end of the film when petra tells chris that the farmers will never forget them he simply replies that s all a man can ask that is the mystique and legacy of the seven even the character of chris is endowed with human flaws he recklessly took on the young manuel rounding out the seven for luck with tragic results and we see brynner deeply grieved on the screen this is a film of hard lessons learned technically this is a well made film the cinematography is full of crane dolly and tracking shots which gives it both perspective and movement bernstein s score is full and lush and this is the single cohesive element that keeps the seven together the set designs are dark grim and rustic giving the film a pensive psychological depth the payoff for brynner and the viewer comes in the final shot looking at the farmers rebuilding the village he comments i ll be damned vin looks at him and responds i doubt that i doubt that very much they both ride off they just don t make heroes like that any more,positive
the best edition so far however the color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me but what do you want for 10 bucks i saw gorgo a bunch of times in first run and i remember seeing the actual gorgo creature on it s trailer being driven up woodward ave in detroit on it s way to the fox theater a great promo the eyes are the thing i remember most as gorgo rises from the sea those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive the color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes but still this print is the best i ve seen if i live long enough i hope they issue a perfect hd version of this movie i would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that but this is worth the cost a must for any serious collector,positive
i ve owned this workout for about three years i do it on occasion if i feel like i need to slap my legs in to shape it does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body however i have to force myself to do this video the 35 minute warm up is mundane and uninspired by the time i finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes i hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg i also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating in order for me to get through the video i have to put on some different music and turn the tv down until i can just barely hear the instructor s voice to know i m keeping up with the video in my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience,negative
another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it s because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen,negative
venom is one of those movies i thought i would hate because i heard so much negativity about it but i really enjoyed it being a fan of the 70 s and 80 s slashers i crave newer versions because i have seen all the other ones over and over again venom did not disappoint me it starts off with action and never lets up i found it to be one of my favorite new horror slasher flicks the voodoo angle was good but not overplayed i m simple in that i want to see a killer with an axe machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo i don t want to have to wonder was that a dream or was it real as so many movies these days play off of give me an old fashioned slice and dice and i m in heaven and venom gave me that so i hope to see venom 2 if so i m there \( for the record mr jangles used the hook chain before kane in see no evil \),positive
the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie its pretty good itself where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo dorin gray mina harker the invisible man dr jeckyl mr hyde allan quatermain tom sawyer all in the same movie about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors the only real drawback is the length about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes all in all a good popcorn flick,positive

i purchased this movie without reading the reviews based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i ve seen the two main stars in this movie was awful and the sad part is there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout the acting was obviously overdone on purpose i just wish i knew why it didn t come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent in the end i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it,negative
the is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals families and society the film is graphic in its depiction of addiction but as an addiction counselor who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery it is very close to actual tragic events i have seen in the world of addiction the emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent these events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many unfortunately even though some of the content may be offensive to some it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction s final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life watch and learn the truth about severe addiction,positive
that you simply have to see mrs miniver being one a little known film dealing with a fictitious german invasion to a sweet english village went the day well and this film why so because all 3 were made at the start of the war \( early 40 s \) when england stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt hitler and aggresive facism invasion fears were rife the war effort looked hopeless at times as in europe hitler opposing country after country fell to the german aggressors \( not to mention the rampage going on in africa at the hands of rommel aided by the italian forces under mussolini s instruction \) england s small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day it was quite possibly the darkest of times in english history and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect with realistic perfection in which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of british life for a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made \( 1942 \) and i guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely coward s plan an absolute gem and a must see i weep every time i watch it,positive
i agree almost completely with jwalker019 this ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950 s and gianni s is downright embarrassing the costuming there makes everyone look absurd tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good angelica is okay but it is not a part for plowright and i definitely did not like dunja vejzovic as the princess it is great to have this opera on dvd but otherwise it was a big disappointment no goosebumps here i just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the met broadcast with scotto in all three of the 1 acters what a delight some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that s what these need scotto was incredible in suor angelica we should be so lucky to have these performances released on dvd but that is highly unlikely i ve given this la scala dvd 2 stars but that is probably being generous,negative

i remember putting season 9 as the worst season of friends in my book but it s not as bad as i remembered some episodes are actually incredibly funny the faux pas was when they started to have aisha tyler guess star as charlie and have her come between joey and ross also the whole story line with rachel s infatuation for joey could ve been better executed or shouldn t have been there at all it got bad towards the end but i m not disappointed the stuff leadings towards it was classic friends,positive

in terms of both format and style rent despite its superficially modernist tendencies has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition yet it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters in more traditional musicals the long stretches of spoken exposition between song and dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable flesh and blood human beings this is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like phantom of the opera which seems a natural for this type of approach but with material like rent which is small in scale and intimate in scope the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience i know that this play \( and perhaps now even the movie \) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers rent practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism but to someone like myself coming cold to the work rent adds up to much less than the sum of its parts the story a modern day update of la boheme set in greenwich village starts on christmas eve 1989 and ends on christmas eve 1990 this was at the height of the aids epidemic and indeed many of the film s characters primarily gay men and former junkies are struggling with the disease \( aids being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story \) there s also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists \( one is tempted to call them deadbeats \) from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re developing a city block rent with its noble performance artists doing battle against the big bad corporate bullies feels less like a relic from the 80 s than one from the 60 s though intended to be the heroes of the piece the artists and bohemians often come across as na ve painfully self absorbed and annoyingly self righteous an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local atm machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend s name \( the heavily allegorical angel \) as the password \( this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man \) anything s better than actually working i suppose and becoming a tool of corporate america when one of the men finally takes a dreaded job \( a mere sinecure i might add \) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes \( horrors \) he acts as if he is selling his soul to satan and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest to god paycheck i wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them with the exception of newcomer rosario dawson the filmmakers have retained most of the original broadway cast members for the movie and even though their acting isn t all that impressive some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing in his direction chris columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we re watching despite the constantly tracking sometimes even spinning camera he has chosen to employ the film still feels stagy over stylized and artificial in almost every scene as to the libretto by the late jonathon larsen only one tune strikes me as truly memorable while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling one of the problems too with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian pedestrian and prosaic when they aren t pseudo intellectual drivel on the order of the opposite of war isn t peace it s creation that they become unintentionally funny when set to music it s not for nothing that the sharks and the jets didn t actually sing out most of their confrontations there are admittedly some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings i have ever seen in a motion picture in that one crucial moment the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it i don t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for rent \( or of its many devoted followers \) but it s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people especially sensitive artists should be allowed to live on other people s properties for free,negative
this film starts with an event based on a true crime a talk radio show host in denver was killed by an american nazi \( this event inspired the talk radio play and film \) this film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region no mention of their economic status are they losing dollars and population small businesses etc instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him this seems too exaggerated to believe federal agents are aware of this but don t want to act yet their agent is sent back to get more information there are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas the film doesn t explain what created them it shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions no real names of course the federal agent meets to report to her higher ups then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities \( based on real events \) most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group \( the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s \) this federal agency doesn t interfere because they want more information on their aims \( and their leaders \) more terrorism is planned dynamiting a courthouse attacking a power station etc the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day kathy finds a secret list of friends this is quickly copied with a camera the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them gary meets with the leader \( who arrives in a helicopter \) and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator is kathy being served up as a sacrifice gary and kathy travel to chicago where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy \( another lee harvey oswald \) a second lone gunman shoots the politician in front of a building gary fails to shoot and won t ever try this again costa gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film z a few years later his film about rebels in south america was popular his later films have seemed mediocre a better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does better pacing could help the threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film \( e g timothy mcveigh \) those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts a better film today would show the bad results from nafta and free trade in harming most americans economically but hollywood would never allow a film about this war on the middle class the word nafta in greek and arabic refers to petroleum nafta is a symbol for the policies designed for big oil it is like george w bush calling his policy operation iraqi liberation,negative

this movie while not a bomb or a turkey has a couple of serious flaws one is the casting ted wass has lots of credits to his name according to imdb but what a wimpy character less uninteresting washout he is was blake going for a harold lloyd lookalike he got one but there s nothing else to recommend him he looks like a clark kent without the superman suit underneath the other flaw is the length even the opening credits \( using a defreiling patie ripoff style \) go on forever but the slapstick which is masterful as always \( blake having been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies especially those of laurel hardy \) my god does he stretch things out here the cameos are the saving grace especially roger moore s his vocal impersonation of clousseau is perfect why didn t he dub the voice for clousseau in the concurrently filmed trail of the pink panther whoever did that voiceover sounded like sellers on helium it s sad to see our icons age especially burt kwouk who looks and sounds awfully tired david niven looks as close to death as he actually was rich little s uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done subtle and convincing herbert lom s dreyfuss got bigger and more ridiculous in each successive film and harvey korman s prof balls is delightful the entire scene in his shop is a stitch no there will never be another sellers \( and i have no intention of seeing the new film with steve martin \) but blake could have done better with his stopgaps,negative

when we watched this remake of brian s song it was not by design we had requested the 1971 version from netflix but the dvd was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake but instead of sending it back again we thought what the hec let s give it a chance while we didn t expect it to live up to the beloved original nothing could prepare us for how god awful it was so when we saw all the stars given to this remake we were utterly mystified other than mekhi phifer s performance which was pretty good it was a joke sean s maher s brian piccolo was a caricature cartoony and over the top obnoxious maybe they had intended to cast jim carrey in the role but he was busy instead they got maher to do a jim carrey impersonation james caan portrayed piccolo as this outgoing wise cracking guy but he was human and believable not a clown and those football scenes they looked ridiculous at least in the original they used real game footage which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium not at a high school or some sound stage even though the original was a tv movie the performances scenarios and dialog were well done believable touching heartwrenching if you watch it now is it dated of course but there s nothing wrong with that it is current to the time it depicts but this remake reminds us of a very bad melodramatic after school special really it was so bad i can t find adequate words to describe it,negative

wow this was a pretty decent romantic comedy we had this in our collection for months \( possibly years \) and never watched it we decided to watch this film on a whim i have to say that it was better and ever funnier than i thought it would be monica potter is great in her role it s a sweet movie that actually doesn t do to much guy bashing \( the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies \) i am also a big fam of henry thomas and he is great at as well i won t go into the plot here as many others already have but what i am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres \( sweet home alabama 13 going on 30 \) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention the other thing that must be said is with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 \( and over 18 \) why isn t monica potter more famous than she is she can easily be the next julia roberts or meg ryan julia has 2 kids and meg has just hit the wall it s time for a beauty like monica potter to get into the very lucrative romantic comedy genre here s hoping she gets a better agent before it s to late cute movie with a good heart definetly made a date night at home wonderful mark \( for the record 32yrs old straight and yes i enjoyed this movie \),positive

after viewing the avengers with emma peel which i do every evening after the dreadful news enjoying repeats and repeats as well with reluctance i played the hospital dvd i thought it was terrible the diagogue idiotic i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana emma peel would have thrown him across the room i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd i see that this dvd was dated 1971 this was only 4 years after her last avenger episodes dated 1967 in hospital i believe she was 33 years old oh well i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel finall john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode perhaps they will issue hospital 11 and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series robert lyons reno nevad,negative
this is an awesome movie i think its better than anchors aweigh gene kelly and frank sinatra are two baseball players named eddie o brien and dennis ryan who play for the wolves during the off season eddie and dennis are vaudeville stars when they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner k c higgins wants to take an active part in coaching as it turns out the k in k c higgins happens to stand for katherine \( esther williams \) so the new owner is a woman katherine dosn t fall for womanizer eddie so the two don t get along at all dennis does fall for her though but katherine isn t in love with him shirley delwyn \( betty garrett \) has her eyes on dennis and she won t give up on him also in the cast is jules munshin who plays nat goldberg dennis and eddie s baseball pal this movie has a lot of great music the songs include take me out to the ball game frank and gene sing this song as their vaudeville act also williams sings this while swimming in the pool yes indeedy the boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act its about their love life o brien to ryan to goldberg kelly sinatra and munshin sing this song one of the best numbers the right girl for me sinatra sings this song to williams it s fate baby garrett sings this to sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other strictly usa probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party upon st patrick s day kelly dances and sings to this great song he sorta does this irish gig kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was this is one of the best numbers up there w strictly usa at the end kelly sinatra williams garrett sing to strictly usa as the finale it really great the dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called baby face and boys and girls like you and me it also contains the trailers of anchors aweigh on the town and the trailer for this movie also includes notes on frank sinatra and gene kelly for some odd reason i love this movie this is a must see if you are a kelly fan,positive

incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies,negative

don t expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity if you do you are in for a fall both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining this one has no such pretensions it is merely boring the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town s folk out of their claims they do this through intimidation and violence when a couple of friends get hold of a claim they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys to do this they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction they yell they fight they wrestle they shoot and then they do it some more its not very exciting cinema this production is made worse by the dvd i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair the dvd however is of such low quality that who could really tell the edges are clipped off the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it it was not worth the effort spaghetti westerns can be fun this one however needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn,negative
the animation excellent the characters excellent the premise excellent laugh lines plenty of them and well executed this is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on the problem is as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future for kids they don t see a lesson in putting your past to rest they see if you don t like something put it to rest as is r i p dead after the crotchety old man \( doesn t every haunted house need one to heighten the tension \) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off \( again \) also shame on the producers of this movie a kids movie there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour \( babysitter getting it on with boyfriend boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids etc \) it is just not necessary to tell this story i wouldn t let any relative of mine under 14 see this otherwise excellent flick,negative

after starting my 9 11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown what after loose change 2nd ed last year i ve watched and or read just about them all 9 11 press for truth comes out on top in my humble opinion as the best 9 11 timeline presentation out there nothing included that isn t in the mainstream press just on the back page and spread out over five years the film makes few of the outright accusations that loose change 2nd ed does towards any of the events or people involved in 9 11 but delivers more of damning argument that we ve been lied to there weren t just mistakes made but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government i hope that we the people finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out and the bad guys pay good movie,positive
driller killer has without question the best director s commentary of any dvd i have ever seen although driller killer is a far cry from his second film ms 45 it is a classic reno can t seem to buy a thrill despite the fact that he lives with two bombshells he can t get his painting finished to collect for the rent his agent s reaction to his finished painting is absolutely priceless what s worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk band to move in upstairs adding insult to injury the band tony coca cola and the roosters play the grand street stomp a guitar riff that has a great driving force this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of the 1970 s conventions are borrowed from polanski s repulsion and cassaveetes shadows the handheld mingling with the street people of the period shows how filthy nyc was at the time lots of fun driller killer was meant to be listened to loud,positive

for those not aware pumpkinhead 2 is \( supposedly \) the 1994 sequel to 1988 s timeless monster classic pumpkinhead the original was darkly creepy superbly constructed in it s story and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific butchers the story and basically uses the name and a simliar creature suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant sequel it s like a group of writers saw a picture of pumpkinhead on the internet read his name \( and that s all they read \) and decided to make their own movie as for the plot \( if anyone cares \) a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings i ll admit if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie this would ve been worth two or three stars as a so bad it s good b flick but the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it if you haven t seen 1988 s pumpkinhead rent it or buy it it s a horror masterpiece \( especially compared to this \) with so much going for it but avoid this sequel at all costs i hate to put down any product but i feel that this one deserves it,negative

children of the corn ii terence knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage the special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst the acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production the gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to holly upstairs acting school to write such junk and to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me,negative
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern s classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp s performance is chock full of ticks and mannerisms off putting flat self absorbed and finally one note rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton s film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton s part that doesn t make the final product any more watchable it s one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton s other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and or could care less about the final result is a film that s like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio,negative

you know the feeling that feeling of oh my gosh how did i ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end well that s what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film unfortunately because of its all star cast although this wouldn t be the first time in movie history where an all star cast is wasted aside from an interesting peek into the world of yale s secret skull and bones society a delightful cameo by joe pesci and a few too cute by half zingers this movie has little or nothing to offer it doesn t keep one s attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on you realize that you don t even care about the characters matt damon s skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry especially with the beautiful angelina jolie and he is laughably miscast as a father in fairness however with the script he s been given it s hard to see how damon could have done much better the pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends a huge disappoinment especially since director deniro is such a talented actor skip it,negative

i actually saw this movie when it first came out and was so blown away by robert downey jr s performance \( he was just starting out on his illustrious if self destructive career \) that i didn t notice much else about the movie certainly not jami gertz or andrew mccarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it s possible to have on the big screen \( the adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids so there is no real dramatic interest there we have only the kids and their interactions with drugs the party scene and each other \) seeing it again 25 years later well downey s performance still holds up but the rest of the movie is less than zero \( sorry \) the director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes \( unintentionally hilarious in their excesses \) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do and they never develop into anyone we care about the final scene with mccarthy and gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery has no emotional payoff whatever mccarthy says come with me to the east coast gertz responds yes i ll go with you and the viewer says thank god that means the movie s over finally james spader doesn t play a real character either but as other reviewers have noted he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy glad to see he s still getting work in a fairly interesting role on boston legal,negative

the casting here was excellent ben stiller elle macpherson sarah jessica parker were all great in fact i am convinced that elle macpherson can act because of the 3 movies i have now seen her in she plays decidedly different people in each one she is perfectly cast as joe s dream woman i found eric schaeffer s character the least appealing of the whole cast some of the jokes here are wildly funny the audience is never given a clue that the jane lindquist character is only getting involved with joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her i thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually but was not interested in a relationship with him earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants that part did not make sense this could have been improved by some better writing and better character development the humor here is what makes this worth watching,positive

my husband and i are both history and literature buffs so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to dvd we aren t typically hard people to please but this film was one of the most boring movies that i ve seen to date it s not that i don t appreciate artistic visually stimulating movies that have a point perhaps assuming we all knew the story already the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass water trees and more trees apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever \( though i will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there \) this movie represents revisionist history at its worst here we are presented with an idyllic practically un fallen and un corrupted view of the noble savage juxtaposed against the muddy disgusting conniving white man perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some native american life like scalping or the less than environmentally friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs it s fair to say as the post colonial talk goes that native americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years but by shifting to the other extreme don t we fall prey to the same false stereotyping just going the opposite direction,negative
excellent presentation and goes into detail much of which may be unknown to the viewer one minor criticism the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily,positive
between the amended politically correct ending to this famous tale and the so very hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges i couldn t wait for this to be over the animation was very poor quality the music was not the focus my grandchildren lost interest shat else could possibly have been wrong,negative
this movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment sex drugs beating on people stealing whatever keeps boredom at bay there is no script to speak of just watching them being themselves one kid called telly \( about 15 or 16 \) who has aids \( and may not know it \) likes young virgins \( 12 to 14 year old girls \) he s a predator with no conscience at all probably a sociopath and his buddy casper is a dumb punk who swills beer he s just as bad as telly i have no doubt that teens like this exist they existed back in the 70s when i was a teen i m sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don t have children perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing i m sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too and small towns and even rural areas this movie isn t for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them,positive
the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you d better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie,negative
my first favorite television series was twelve o clock high and i had at least two models of the memphis belle when i was kid all of which simply reflects the fact that the b 17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b 17 parked out on somebody s front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it a couple of decades later one of the few b 17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one \( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought \) for all i know that particular b 17 ended up flying in the 1990 film memphis belle when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the memphis belle was on display \( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton ohio this october \) the memphis belle \( serial no 41 24485 \) was one of 12 750 b 17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler s europe without losing a crew member the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down the belle flew from november 7 1942 to may 17 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton jones \( scandal \) from the script by monte merrick \( staying together \) that simply means that besides the fact that the memphis belle was named for a lady friend \( margaret polk \) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same \( designed by the famous artist george petty \) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission which was over lorient france and not bremen germany \( the belle flew there on its 21st mission \) the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane s mascot a scotty dog named stuka so if you want something closer to the true story of the pilot robert morgan and the memphis belle you want to check out william wyler s 1944 documentary the memphis belle a story of a flying fortress what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clich s from war movies involving airplanes then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator tate donovan as the co pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home d b sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret reed edward diamond as the flight engineer courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the belle of course it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the memphis belle is remembered for completing that final mission so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run \( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the belle and they changed the name of the aircraft as well \) but even if the belle survives there are other several b 17 crews on the mission who will not still the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated allowing modine s character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan s character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else s job,positive
i rented this movie for about six dollars and i have to say even that was a waste of money i thought this movie was incredibly over acted boring and hard on the eyes the thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did they were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial for the superficial people out there i wouldn t watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won t get it when i found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible i have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment,negative
i thought this movie was great it s definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie goer it s probably the best dark comedy i ve ever seen \( only to rival the masterpiece that is heathers \) the dialog in this movie with leave you with one liners for years to come after seeing party girl i fell in love with parker posey and when i saw this i loved her even more this instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time but then again i m a huge fan of good dark comedies and i have a sick sense of humor everyone i know absolutely loved this move \( including my mom \) in any event this is a definite must see for any fan of parker posey and dark comedy excellent,positive
i love the firm workouts and i love the instructor allie so i was so excited to try this new workout i was unfortunately extremely disappointed this workout was not complicated but it also wasn t much of a workout i didn t get my heart rate up at all and didn t break a sweat some of the moves are just not very good and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying the disco part was my favorite but overall this is a workout that i can honestly say i would rather have the money then the workout i will keep it and periodically do it on a very light day or in addition to another workout but that s just because i have it i ve tried a couple other of the new firm workouts that are more worth the money this one i am sad to say is not,negative
oliver stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a historian platoon and born on the fourth of july were great films but jfk though brilliantly made was a sign that something was off about stone s mental processes natural born killers could have been a scathing indictment of our media s obsession with violence and decadence but instead it s just exhibit a in the indictment wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize,negative

is anyone else having issues with these discs when you first place the discs in the player it skips over the main menus then the menu button will only start and stop the episode selected but it will not return you to the main menu there is no spanish or portuguese dubbed audio on the discs \( despite what the menus and packaging claim \) and the episodes automatically play with spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned off the only way to avoid this is to choose other subtitles with the remote this appears to be an authoring issue as i am using a two year old sony dream system dvd player and have not had these issues with previous seasons i m exchanging my discs immediately but i have a feeling they might all be bad anyone else hear about these issues,negative
i love david cross s comedy i love his stand up i love mr show but this dvd is not kinda boring it is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen there may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd there is no accounting for taste but 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released,negative
the movie starts out with our hero izo being gruesomly crucified because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really including having sex with mother nature a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face being killed several times a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back killing little children killing a group of mothers in the hallway vampires being attacked by a swat team and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar while he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion this movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it,positive

one of the most compelling events of the release of kenneth lonergan s you can count on me is that it gave visibility to mark ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash lives of life of unattached agony and isolation he s a loner and a drifter medicating his self pity with pot and short lived relationships his sister sammy played wonderfully by laura linney reacts to the same tragedy by being in many ways an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash this film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another the ride is never easy in this film no easy answers are given just as important this film which deals with the pain of loss never descends into the maudlin hallmark movie sap that other films would balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss amazingly he does it in a fast paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic matthew broderick for example plays a hilarious role of sammy s neurotic anal retentive boss at the bank the conflict between him and sammy leads to a plot point that i ll let you discover in the film but most of all this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such an endearing sympathetic sometimes infuriating character you won t forget him,positive
at last a full length jimmy buffett concert on dvd it s been a while coming but this is a beauty there are so many highlights it s hard to know where to start perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the dvd the sound is superb the camera work spot on and the real essence of a jimmy buffett concert is captured perfectly the song mix is terrific everything from buffett classics like volcano to new classic like piece of work to iconic covers like southern cross seeing jimmy and the coral reefers perform in daylight and night time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a buffett concert is such an all encompassing experience for me a favourite moment is the concert finale of steve goodman s city of new orleans steve now resides under home plate at wrigley and i m sure he was singing along as well buffett fans and new parrotheads alike will find this dvd one to watch many times over,positive
i am a fan of dbz i am a fan of goten i think hercule is funny and i think 18 is hot yet this movie sucked it was missing what makes dbz so great lots of action and a great plot broly is overused and this completely ruins him like most dbz movies it doesn t fit into the timeline if we worked it in then goten and trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the fusion technique had this movie taken place after then the fight would be a lot more interesting in short if you want to see every dbz movie then rent it if you insist on collecting the whole series wait until movie collection 4 comes out,negative
i saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001 but i didn t pay too close attention because i forgot about it however i remembered seeing it in theaters one day when i was browsing the dvd section and decided to give it another shot at home i am so glad i did leelee sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film she has a bright future in acting ahead of her basically what happens is ruby \( sobieski \) and her brother rhett s \( trevor morgan \) parents die in a car accident their parents wished for them to go live with the family s former neighbors the glasses \( who had since moved to malibu \) played by stellan skarsgard and diane lane needless to say ruby and rhett s carefree lives are changed dramatically rhett falls for all the gifts that the glasses buy for him but ruby isn t fooled so easily she begins to suspect that her parents death wasn t an accident and starts to investigate she sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the glasses that only make her more suspicious eventually she figures out that the glasses are behind the car accident and are now after ruby and rhett s 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents i won t give away the rest but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second rent it or better yet buy it it s well worth your while,positive
i haven t seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block busters i had to rent it my favorite part is when tom essex played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw the head and the head said get that damn screwdriver out of my head i couldn t stop laughing it was so funny i never really liked many horror comedy movies but this one is really good the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook he was not only funny but he was very brave and sexy to boot if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing he makes me want to watch it over and over and over again,positive

robert redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl the state of art in all its wholeness redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator this picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious artistic and perfect american film in the last quarter of century besides the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss redford s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and i really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent and so the new directors to come understand the true cinema meaning is art thanks to his generous personal effort for having created the sundance festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years scarlet johansson,positive
maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer repeat is spelled reapeat on top of that the acting was horrible this movie didn t take itself seriously enough ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor,negative

well i wrote the review about this set and boy was i disappointed when i got it i see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection the transfers are terrible and the sound is worse come on guys at least try to put some effort into it i got the set watched it and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use what a waste of money,negative
this is the first movie i have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played eight women is the story of well eight women who are trapped by a snowstorm all 5 inches of it the man of the house has been murdered in the night young and old black and white of different classes the women must try to determine who the killer is eight women is also a movie about secrets of which everyone seems to have several the plot has more twists and turns than an alpine road on the tour de france yet the first 2 3 of the film is tolerable funny and even a bit interesting the characters are self interested and fun there s dotty old grandma a prissy hysterical virgin aunt the dead man s vampish sister and coltish young maid two daughters a somber yet elegant wife \( catherine deneuve \) and a black cook plenty of class and age tension to make three movies did i mention the music every twenty minutes or so one of the characters breaks into song these are always those stereotypical french songs full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime that are tedious to american ears and bizarre while one character sings the rest do slow little dances strange by the 2 3 mark i was going to give this quirky film 4 stars but soon the plot line spun out of control getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience,negative
i ll make this short and sweet this is by far the best bond movie of them all imho excellent work by connery and the rest of the cast,positive

this a mystery triller starring tom berenger gretta scacchi corbin bernsen joanne whalley kilmer and bob hoskins it s the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically crashing all the way she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm while he amazingly lives at first leaving him in a coma but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia later after being nursed back to health and falling in love with his wife all over again he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller but comes predictable fast i knew the key mysteries almost immediately and i m sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law order episodes will agree eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again,negative

when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each husband killing wife after wife a man who enjoys murder and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it if you don t heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny \( i wouldn t take it for free \),negative

it takes an hbcu graduate to write about the hbcu experience period just look at a different world and how bad the first season was debbie allen \( a howard grad i believe \) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed so it s no surprise that spike lee the morehouse man would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin i m not saying that you had to attend an hbcu to understand school daze but you had to have attended one to get the real flavor of what it was like and you have to have an open mind any hbcu alum saying that this film wasn t realistic is flat out lying yes it hit on some things that the old folks call dirty laundry \( such as hazing color issues those who think that getting an education makes you white and so on \) but those things are real at hbcus yes even today \( major props to spike for having that one dark skinned sista in the gamma rays isn t that always the way \) and there are no good people or bad people spike leaves that decision up to you julian had his good points \( his intelligence leadership and pride in his town school etc \) and dap had his bad points \( his blatant bigotry and bullying \) and both of them had legitimate points one thing spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis no offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a pwc but in my experience at a predominately white high school i noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike they particpated in a more destroying from within kind of system and grew wide eyed and offended when confronted even with solid proof \( i would never spread rumors about you sleep with your boyfriend steal your term paper \) black students on the other hand will take anyone head on whether that person is the school president captain of the football team the richest kid on campus crippled doesn t matter your status doesn t count if you go to an hbcu i had a friend who saw sd and said that is so unrealistic since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time she graduated from the university of texas enough said i m so grateful for this film and its realistic portrayal of black hbcu students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare and that people only go to hbcus because they can t get into a real college i wouldn t trade my experience at florida a m university for a degree at any pwc rattlers,positive
this is my first review for amazon i ve always felt that the reviews that i read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that i liked not this time i have an extensive collection of anime everything from the really silly stuff filled with fan service to the very serious classics that so many fans rave about i m not really into the mecha thing though i do have a lot of it it s the animation first that drives my interest then its the story and the character development are close seconds appleseed has all that i m looking for in an anime and in spades great characters a well crafted plot and some of the best animation i have ever see to say as some reviewers have that the movement in this version are unnatural is more than unfair it s just not true all action is extremely lifelike and the action scenes are the best i ve ever seen i actually found myself reversing the disc to rewatch some action repeatedly something i never do i ve owned this version of appleseed a few weeks now and i have watched it at least five times and am looking forward to another veiwing soon i have relied on amazon reveiws to decide whether or not to buy anime in the past so i hope that this reveiw is helpful there is a lot of good anime worth investing in and this one is near the top of my list,positive
above the rim is an entertaining street drama that focuses around kyle lee watson an inner city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him he won t listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game as he thinks that he is the best player ever he s been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout s attention but he does catch birdie s eyes when he plays birdie is a well known gang leader who offers kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a shoot out basketball contest that means the world to him kyle being impatient as ever agrees to join not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him a high school security guard with a past knows the danger that birdie presents and he is the only who has a chance to get through to kyle before it is too late not only is this a very good basketball movie but it is also an intense and character driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life and how we have to live with them in the long run the film has some great performances from duane martin marlon wayans and the late tupac shakur even though everybody is great in their roles the showstopper is indeed shakur he gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over my only complaint is the length of the movie it s true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half isn t short but i think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie i think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story still it is a really good movie that didn t disappoint me the dvd doesn t have a whole lot to offer you can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen depending on your preference the movie looks and sounds very good the only special features that are offered are movie trailers and those aren t even that great i would ve loved it if they included the music video regulate by warren g and nate dogg in fact given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie they could ve included a couple of music videos it s not a great dvd but at least it s not that expensive i really enjoyed above the rim it may not be flawless but it definitely does more right than wrong the characters are what really dominate the movie even if you re not a fan of the game it s still something to check out if you re a fan of character drama exciting intense conflict driven and full of heart above the rim is a very well done film michael cran,positive
in response to the earlier reviewer this is sergio garrone s django il bastardo not the other film the reviewer mentioned django il bastardo is a small gem among spaghetti westerns a low budget b movie in which a ghost \( django \) avenges his own death \( a topic later adapted by clint eastwood for his high plains drifter \) hence steffen s wooden acting is totally appropriate for the role a little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors \( a standout is luciano rossi as the main baddie s insane brother \),positive

i am not a horror movie fan in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me but this one indeed made me literally crap myself i caught this movie during the midnight hours on ifc 2 years ago and luckily the movie was just starting so i got to see it from beginning to end this movie is basically about a man named frank zito \( joe spinell \) who s a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women because he feels he s getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute after her death frank feels alone but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years frank lives in a tiny apartment in new york city in which he keeps several mannequins he uses these mannequins by putting his victim s bloody scalps on it s heads when he spots a woman named anna \( caroline munro \) a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her but kind of a romantic interest he takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts but will he change his mind about her and make her become another one of his victims some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut wrenching especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station and she hides in a bathroom stall i felt my heart pounding the whole entire time the effects were realistic \( nice job tom savini \) they don t come close to todays even though the movie was released in 1980 joe spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real and not only that but he physically looked the part too the scenes where he s in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes i have ever seen in a movie i believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there because we get to see the results of how an alone mistreated child might turn out this isn t one of those lame zombie movies it s the real deal if you like horror and a lot of gore and you haven t seen this then i recommend you watching this,positive
incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much \( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others \) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies,negative
if you are looking for something shocking don t bother with this movie rape scene why doesn t she run why doesn t she fight how come there s all this blood on her all of a sudden where did that come from stupid revenge scenes first of all i wasn t upset enough to thirst for revenge second of all the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene what you ve basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake scene for scene including every gratuitous moment and it would get made it would show in theaters and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying go rent irreversible it s much better at this sort of thing,negative
i saw the original about 4 5 times from 1970 1971 this one is not much different just modestly i had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years but was unable because the studio \( warner bros \) refused to release it under any format i was thrilled that it was finally released and have since been watching it with many friends most had no idea this movie was ever out i was particularly interested in anita palenburg she has really changed over the last 38 years the content may be a bit provacative for most \( sex and violence \) but the quality are extraodinary for that era this one is a must for anyone,positive

i don t understand why there are so many low reviews here this movie was one of the funniest movies i ve ever seen also it was very unique i think that too many people are trying to project these actions in real life this movie is fiction all the people who gave this movie a bad review should stop trying to see what s real about this movie and just sit back and laugh this movie was extremely funny,positive
this is not a good film i wanted to like it because i love south park and i think that trey parker and matt stone are comedic geniuses while it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance overall it s just not very funny i think i laughed twice during the whole film watch it to see the south park guys before they were stars but don t expect much,negative

during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was spot on and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood it s not that doom is really a bad movie sure it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters it s just a normal monster shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense and that s it i m sure the movie would ve been big had it been released 10 years ago todays generation is probably sick of go nowhere do nothing action films such as doom okay so it does go somewhere but the film isn t really designed to build to an awe inspiring creative story doom is the kind of movie you don t really want to seek out you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90 minute action fix so you rent the movie watch it and then forget about it the next morning of course i m sure you don t forget to rewind the tape because that s impolite the rock never should have left wrestling it was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans \( and the rock means millions \) really miss him come back home rock please,negative
first let me start off by saying this ken sushi volume 1 is unquestionably the best video guide for making sushi i have had a chance to see the other guides and quite frankly they just don t cut it poor camera work and even worse instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video \( or any culinary instructional video for that matter \) also being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly \( people want to learn from someone experienced not enthusiastic \) finally we have a video that is taught by a professional in the sushi scene and he really takes the time to lay out all the techniques he s developed over the years so that with a little practice \( and the benefit of not having to take the time ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi creation \) i was actually able to make some really great sushi the camera work is great no shakes or stutters i didn t find myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality truthfully this video is done so well you will just find yourself immersed in what ken is teaching \( it plays a lot like a chef martin yan instructional video \) also it seems a lot of time was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi creation yet developed enough so that someone completely new to the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a wholesome delicious dish if you take the time to watch the video a few times and practice along with it you will make sushi good enough to eat and present to your friends family \( just utterly show off \) i m just really glad i can finally say there is now a sushi instructional video that i feel was worth every penny of my purchase if you want to really learn how to make sushi well then ken sushi volume 1 will be your number one resource the only negative thing i have to say is where the heck is volume two,positive

alec baldwin has always been the best host of snl \( along with walken and spacey \) and this makes a pretty good case why the opening sketch with the press conference about prince charles is priceless and what could be more demented than canteen boy baldwin is so over the top in that that what is a really really sick joke is actually funny but the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time the tony bennet show \( i was seizing during this one \) the joe pesci show \( with baldwin doing deniro \) and the zinger sketch which just got funnier as it went along even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re recording his greeting only to listen back to it and hear a gay man there are a couple of clunkers planet truth was just not that funny and maybe two others didn t need to be here including one so so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included paul mccartney the bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on air and a great audio track by baldwin and the producer of snl which provides lots of really really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves absolutely hilarious,positive

this film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave i originally saw it for free and afterwards i still felt screwed it stank so badly that i checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre yeah i know call me mister tact a horror comedy that s neither slightly funny nor remotely scary this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic an american werewolf in london \( which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made \) the filmakers had a lot to live up to and boy they blew it in every department the effects were ludicrous the cast was lost the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues and the director should have been shot \( with something other than lots of narcotics \) this film is a textbook example of the hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew if you have already been suckered into buying this dvd i feel your pain you are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack,negative
i tried to rent this dvd from an online service about a week ago unfortunately the dvd was damaged and unplayable but not in the usual way i ve seen before \( like a disc cracked all the way through \) it looked like someone had turned the playable side face up and tapped a small nail with a hammer on it the cracks had that kind of splintery pattern like a broken window anyway i returned the copy and ordered another which i received today again this one is also unplayable and is cracked in an odd way i just reported this problem online to the dvd rental company and ordered a replacement copy however i let them know that they may want to check their inventory of this dvd as someone may be intentionally destroying the dvds if i get another one that is cracked or unplayable in any way i m going to just buy a copy because the movie must really have gotten under someone s skin for them to do something like that,positive

tihs dvd truly has incredible camerawork and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins but some things people don t realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told please take the time to read this many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim with programs and circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets concealing them and are dragged ashore making it easier to violently wrestle them into slings these dolphins captured while they may be smiling in appearance \( which is the way their faces were genetically designed \) are ripped away from their beloved podmates and torn from their environment how would you like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water forced to live with the loud sounds of people screaming the filtration system running and very little space to swim in the process of capturing dolphins for human entertainment many die in the process stress severely affects a dolphin s body and many suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution on top of that dependent calves \( baby dolphins \) who have spent the entirety of their lives with their mothers often get torn from them leaving them helpless even if they are released while you can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to be having fun would it not be too much to consider the fact that they might miss their former companions are they really happier stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be fed keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or swim with program for dolphins captured in japan the industry has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly in the process by the government i believe this film spends too little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to dolphins over 7 000 000 dolphins have died at the hands of humans since the late 1950s i think a few minutes at the beginning of the film doesn t nearly suit the need to inform the audience of the issue tuna fisheries whose products are falsely labeled as dolphin safe \( there are established kill minimums now for tuna companies \) need to be exposed intentional killings in japan \( especially \) south america and all over the world need to be publicized but i also understand that this is a family film mainly but i think it is also important to inform young viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans they are the ones who will need to make the difference in the future please just remember this next time you watch this film while dolphins are valued by many they are targeted by many as well as a way of easy money making this film is more of a sugar coated production although it certainly is beautiful as are the dolphins seen in the flim i would recommend a film entitled dolphin defender for those who seek some informative footage behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive hunts,positive
six degrees of separation is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture not that that is a bad thing the script by john guare is brilliant it simply seems a little static with its marvelous plays on words repeated phrases and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art \( stockard channing and donald sutherland both in peak form \) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young african american con artist \( will smith \) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as kitty carlisle ian mckellen artists chuck close and kazuko mary beth hurt bruce davidson etc a really fine ensemble there are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made this was one of will smith s entries into film as well as one of the gifted stockard channing s finest roles highly recommended for repeated viewings grady harp october 0,positive
even though i am not a streisand fan i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand s character making her attractive no irresistible to the main male character the problem is she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover somebody \( probably streisand \) thinks that highlighted hair a tight black cocktail dress and a baggy lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress casual clothes and everyday looks are disgusting baaaaaamp \( that s the fallacy alarm going off men in my experience don t care much about clothes and makeup \) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character s losing weight by riding an exercise bike but she looked exactly the same afterward no detectable weight difference yet truly the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand discussing her baby and early childhood photos with her mother \( played by lauren bacall \) blubbers wazz i a pretty baby wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee in that one scene streisand s neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed the whole movie is about this issue and it s amazing that an entire cast crew and production company would devote themselves to b s s emotional issues like that i really think that the funny girl phenomenon somehow ruined streisand s thought processes the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light years away from the stereotyped northern european beauty standard of the time \( think grace kelly think ingrid bergman \) i recall reading about how her glowing complexion thick hair and good figure \( as well as her energy and voice \) carried her through despite her looks long nose large lips slanted eyes myself i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar but she certainly doesn t look like grace kelly so why can t she accept this the majority of us women whatever our race color or bone structure learn to live with and love who we are at least i hope we do this movie is not about that this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable maybe i should ve given it only one star,negative
while some critics can argue with dan brown s research and reasoning on certain historical points one thing these da vinci debunking presentations will never be able to refute is this the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity primarily by the catholic church and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago 1969 nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still quite frankly shocking and debasing sorry but upon this rock of male dominancy was built the church thank you again dan brown by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations obscurations and lies these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources worth trillions through guilt control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus actual relationship with the women in his life or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men s club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship to answer these questions some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self interest or from spiritual corruption the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view lord only knows what plunder they contain,negative
not very familiar with noam chomsky s work but i have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments this film is proof of those arguments noam chomsky has facts refers to original sources provides context and analysis and leaves you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well research argument this film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world america s invasion of iraq the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9 11 and other topics are rich and insightful this film provides a nice balance on chomsky by giving us some insight into him which is interesting i find him more fascinating now than i did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material this film gives those new to noam chomsky s books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so after watching this film i went out and read 9 11 and his latest book while good the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner,positive
the print looks like you re watching it through muddy water is this something to do with the unclear public domain status of this and other of capra s works doesn t he have a family that could help out his dvds the way that chaplin s family has done or even to use the opposite extreme the family of edgar ulmer who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies the point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice and all the various dvds of meet john doe are painful to watch we ve heard for years of the re worked ending of the film and that another one exists \( or existed at one time \) bring it on for now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching gary cooper react to barbara stanwyck s pure life it s sort of like ball of fire but a bit more subtle moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two because cooper s slow moving nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to stanwyck s vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion she doesn t even have to speak she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture okay the movie writes itself into a corner for what else is going to happen except that if gary cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it s established with the viewers this has always been doe s problem that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself and it didn t work in 1943 and it still isn t working now it s great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as hollywood tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma,positive
i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i don t know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one hasn t seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i wasn t shocked disturbed or upset just bored,negative
this could have been an excellent documentary but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly this is particularly true in the way it depicts sparta as being some kind of womyn s power state which is absurd somewhat comically the narrator enhances the story of sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus she tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi sexuality hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a feminist wonderland but that s exactly what is implied i don t know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother yeah right unless of course husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful to many counter culturalists history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program unfortunately that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work as for bettany hughes i agree that she is quite attractive but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing sparta i ll take victor davis hanson any day over her i recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians,negative
when once and again first began i dismissed it as a show for just women but after watching just one episode i found myself hooked this was unlike any show i had seen before i actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families once and again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love it goes much deeper than that once and again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well but then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well with the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between lily \( sela ward \) and rick \( billy campbell \) and how their ex s still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children once and again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today even thought it s time on television was short once and again showcased the acting talents of sela ward and billy campbell and launched the careers of shane west and evan rachel wood i am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on dvd and that they have finally decided to release seasons 2 and 3,positive

these 2 guys playing harry and lloyd were so disastrous they didn t even know how to act corny when they re supposed to jim carrey might be crazy at times but i don t think he s this bad the whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen nevertheless it has some funny moments like when jessica s parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet the whole idea of a special class was just so stupid nothing made sense i didn t see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash the first one was a lot better than this one jim carrey and jeff daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier these 2 were worse than dumb and weren t even funny at all i guess dumb and dumberer would be better if it were still jim carrey and jeff daniels starring but nooo it had to be these 2 who i don t even know please don t watch it guys it may be funny for some guys but it s mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild watch the first one kirstie mabita,negative

let me preface this review by stating that if i had to do this 90 minute workout in its entirety i d probably never reach for it it s just too long but in its dvd format karen voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable it s set up so that you can follow it in logical sections and best of all you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the amazingly thorough floor workout which is terrific for those like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from performing squats and lunges i am able to successfully break this whole program down into warmup arms abs cooldown stretch mondays and thursdays and warmup floor legs cooldown stretch on tuesdays and fridays and each intense workout is about 45 minutes music and clothing especially the men s outfits are dated but i can get over it \( though i m sure there are others who cannot \) broken into shorter segments i rate this 4 5 stars which i round up to 5,positive
compared to argento i must say that mario bava is for me entirely overrated he might be a pioneer but as a stylist he is sadly lacking his seventies work is more often than not tiresome and tawdry even if you like horror films argento fans seeking out shock on the strength of daria nicolodi s starring role music by two members of goblin \( under the nom de plume a libra \) and srgento s supposed giallio based debt to bava should buy shock with caution although it is an authentic slice of eurohorror and better than the contemporary garbage horror hollywood churns out it is still a fairly dreary dull repetitive flick with few high points and many annoyances finally the sound and picture quality are fairly poor even when compared to some of jess franco s rubbish \( and that s saying something \) my dvd of the silly she killed in ecstasy filmed years before this looks and sounds far far better shame daria never made films without argento that are better than this,negative
this movie is a dud who d have thought that john wayne and the director of support your local sherrif would have joined forces for this stinker the characterization hints at being good but really its character actors doing what they do best being good support characters its a good thing to because the duke really just mailed this one in first what this movie does well ann margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show it is interesting that the bad guys chasing ann margaret and john wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end when you get to the end you learn why but it works well to keep them faceless the last 10 minutes is good top notch with a twister of an ending however what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right john wayne is absolutely uninspired he is just a cardboard version of himself a cranky mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character and when they do it seems very very clunky at least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long distance shots of people riding horses sometimes they ride over hills sometimes they ride through valleys we get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the rio grande \( the border with mexico \) fill in this time with some character development some dialogue anything the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie all in all it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so john wayne could have another movie in the theaters too bad a crack team of writers could have made it something special my suggestion get cowboys or either of the two rooster cogburn movies or support your local sherrif and see this actor and this director doing much better work,negative
this animated perversion of star wars is an insult to one of the best sci fi epics of all times the characters are utterly rediculus \( seriously if the jedi were that actually powerful why did they need the clones \) there is no plotline to speak of and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting if you want a good build up to episode iii i suggest playing star wars republic commando and reading labyrinth of evil and the other clone wars novels don t wast your money on this it s not worth it,negative

asks the interviewer what place would you give shoot the piano player in relation to your other films answers director fran ois truffaut no place simply the second film i made considering his first feature film was the four hundred blows and his third was jules et jim truffaut s matter of factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile shoot the piano player is worth smiles too it s a clever film playful at times even funny more than anything however it defies categorization the movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy suspense and inevitability tragedy and love and gangsters girl friends and violence it s the story of charlie koller \( charles aznavour \) a piano player in a paris dive who used to be eduoard saroyan a famous pianist whose wife committed suicide truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants he can t go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing he thinks about what he should do but can t do it and then circumstances take over charlie thanks to his brothers finds himself in a gangland underworld where double crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow some say shoot the piano player is an homage to american gangster films perhaps it is but i challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie the film is original funny moving and sad it s the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about all i know is that i was moved by charlie we leave him where we met him playing piano in a paris dive charles aznavour a diminutive man with a hangdog look plays charlie perfectly aznavour is probably better known in the u s as a singer but in france he s seen as both an actor and a singer he s a minimalist he says about himself charlie thinks too much and does too little aznavour lets us see into charlie s soul with few words it s a marvelous performance that left me saddened by charlie but liking him the criterion dvd transfer is first rate criterion gives us two discs the first has the movie and a commentary track the second disc contains interviews by aznavour and marie dubois who played charlie s girlfriend lena plus excerpts from documentaries featuring truffaut and other extras the criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and truffaut,positive

let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set i m really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can still inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is do not buy this set spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6 1 dts ex glory alongwith hours of endless in depth bonus features which probably you ll spend rest of your life watching please be aware these new editions do not contain dts tracks no commentary tracks by the director weta workshop or the cast all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc and nothing else it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again and even this is not the end once the hd format gains a little more acceptance they ll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy beware extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience in terms of films or bonus features go get it its worth all the money spent,negative

i had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the infantastic dvds from amazon i waited over two months kept getting reassured that they were still coming and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme but amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7 11 days which is at best a misrepresentation and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can t provide the product at all at this point i don t really care whose fault it is that the product is never available amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted,negative
i love speilberg films i really do but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap i just do not like it its not my thing i can t belive that richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense if you want to watch it then go ahead we all have different tastes however if you want to see a real speilberg film watch ones like duel jaws et schindler s list jurassic park the lost world jurassic park and the indiana jones trilogy,negative

interestingly this pro apartheid film was produced and written by jack abramoff now famous for pleading guilty to fraud and tax evasion in the course of orchestating the biggest american congressional corruption scandal in a generation yes the same man who bribed over 60 congressmen and senators robbed several native american tribes blind tried to take out life insurance policies on tribal elders with himself as the beneficiary and called the choctaw tribal council monkeys and troglodytes had an interesting earlier career he was disqualified from the student government election in his beverly hills elementary school for exceeding spending limits he took over the young republican movement in college with his schoolmates including ralph reed of the christian coalition and longtime republican insider grover norquist but more relevant to this movie well into the 1990 s while actively working in the hollywood film industry he worked both covertly and overtly to support the racist whites only apartheid goverment of the old south africa and to oppose and discredit nelson mandela and the anc s struggle for majority rule and racial equality during this period he conceived this piece of bizarre propoganda paid for by the apartheid government in the old south africa equating the struggle for black liberation in south africa with communism and the soviet union and openly placing his sympathies with the racist minority afrikkaner government the hero of the film is based on the many mercenaries or so called soldiers of fortune as they are called in their trade magazine which like the makers of this film were also enthusiastic about private killers being hired to murder activists fighting against apartheid an amazing historical anomoly this piece has even more significance in the wake of the currently unfolding scandal which promises to be one of the largest in history involving bribery favors protection of sweatshops \( in us colonies where women are forced into having abortions \) fraud the chritian coalition pitting one tribe against another to essentially steal money from native america and possibly the gangland style murder of his former business partner the owner of sun cruises when he complained about being defrauded in the sale of his cruise line my advice buy it used for historical purposes not new this guy has made more than enough money off the backs of the american people let s not forget how fear of communism was used to justify murder racial segregation perversion of the constitution police state style abuses of civil rights and many other crimes against humanity let s learn the lessons of history and preserve what is good about the usa let this movie be a record of the power of hollywood to either perpetuate lies that are used to kill and abuse people or to turn away from evil and tell the truth let s make a different legacy this time around,negative
ahh iron eagle a classic of the 1980 s golan globus production mill with the current spate of historic current military movies it s sometimes good to see how hollywood s come in trying to get the details right one can t do much better than using this flick as a baseline in case you aren t already familiar with this gem louis gosset jr playing a reserve air force colonel and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country ok i ll name it libya to rescue the kid s dad pop gets shot down when he s intercepted in international waters but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid s challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully s using his dirt bike suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe he doesn t get his slot at the usaf academy though you gotta take the bad with good i guess when the words on dad get back to the family this kid uses his base network to get access to imagery enemy air defense data and two f16s carrying a b52 s worth of ordinance all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents no less \( if only strike planning was this easy \) of course the kid has flown training missions with his dad and has a boatload of simulator time so he s a natural to fly the mission he convinces gosset to go along with him and his two ship is on the way the flying scenes are nothing spectacular with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys and kfirs \( modified mirages \) acting as migs cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer i m guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit flight and combat models anyway lots of explosions on the way in lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone go figure he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land \( \) and pick him up more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground taxi s out and takesoff he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued rather than the prison sentence for espionage and theft of government property that lou the kid his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should ve got he gets his slot at the air force academy the end overall i guess lou s performance was fairly good but everyone else performed at the grade b level this flick is note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid s buds worth seeing for laughs and as a film version of a kid s pilot fantasy,negative
king vidor s rather contrived adaptation of tolstoy s epic riddled with miscast actors a boring script and a hurried screenplay in short another one of those 50 year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into hollywood s vaults of oblivion the story follows the main characters of tolstoy s novel such as natasha \( audrey hepburn \) prince andrei \( mel ferrer \) and pierre \( henry fonda \) the film is too short for the novel and the acting stinks particularly that of henry fonda as pierre henry fonda is as stiff as fossilized wood in this film his pondering stare and preaching voice reminds me of a bad charleton heston film as far as the battle scenes so greatly praised by the main reviewer they are as sparse as they are realistic all of the costumes and props in this film are horribly fake in short the only thing that remains impressive about this film is the fact that hollywood bothered to put it on dvd apart from that the acting is as worthless as the contrived screenplay and shallow dialogue don t buy this film,negative

i read the various reviews about the movie the hunter i was surprised at the extremeties in preference much like owning a fiero which i do the movie as is the fiero is overall slower than most of mcqueen s however he still pulls it off showing his great acting ability when you take the character papa thorson he was a different breed in the wrong time era who else but mcqueen could make him so realistic i haven t seen the movie in several years i have been wanting a copy to add to my library i intend to do that today oh yeah the relationship between the movie and the fiero i have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it i loved the hunter and i love my fiero for those of you who don t understand sorry steve mcquen displayed more of his talent even while ill god bless you steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us,positive
georges seurat was totally insane by the age of 32 knowing that helps stephen sondheim s genius show through sunday in the park with george is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting a sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte the first act is completely devoted to a set of sundays spanning 2 years of seurat s life and the end of his relationship with a long time lover the dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard nosed painter yet comical points shine through the second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the great grandson of georges \( also played by mandy patinkin \) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame like other sondheim shows it is at times long winded but altogether entirely enjoyable mandy and mrs peters voice have so much emotion and power that with the correct sound system you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances with commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals,positive
my 2 year old loves his video the animations are unusual but they are full of flare color and imagination the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter can t get enough of them the main character moustache and the rest of the characters are all well imagined and fun as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time and the semi interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line i personally love this video and would recommend it,positive
it is almost ashame that north amercian culture needs bill maher after all shouldn t honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is on victory begins at home maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind maher s central premise that the war on terrorism can be aided by what people do in the united states really is almost a common sense arguement yet maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match maher does this by not pretending he isn t politically opinated in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on the rarity of straight forward unabashed opinion on victory begins at home he is more democrat then republican but he openly sides with neither instead he rails at all presenting himself as a full person neither liberal nor conservative right wing or left wing the end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered there is no spin here what maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it with all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media political columnists and special interest groups know wonder we need him so much,positive
okay the rating above is not going to be liked but i have to be truthful the only good thing going for this movie was the return of snake plissken this film s plot was essentially a rehash of the original escape from new york a bit more special effects \( which in fact did not make this a better movie \) when i go to a sequel i expect to get what i paid for a totally new adventure with the same character characters kurt russell s character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them obviously the movie doesn t really know where it s going as it takes two scenes \( 15 minutes of the film \) \( 1st scene president commandant and lackey give snake the mission \) \( 2nd scene commandant and lackey brief snake before he leaves for the mission \) to explan to the audience what s the basic conflict i guess either carpenter or russell are just getting too old to take a great leap and recount either an earlier snake plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling i also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer carpenter russell please don t tell me money caused you to revisit a cult figure some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of cliff robertson stacy keach steve buscemi and pam grier robertson keach and grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters sorry snake i don t love l a the big green pointy eared one,negative

this is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of america in fact the real star of the show asie from the ubiquitous red ford taurus is the scenery of america itself the camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene but the point of the series is to give a reader s digest view of places people can visit but excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series each trip is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral family vacations combined into a one hour program this is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm,positive
supposed being victimized by local communist regime and soviet oppressors since august 1968 a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals no wonder sex is a fix for such a lucky and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with southern european rather than slavic appearance a little extended up to 165 minutes of screening romantic tale with some near porno inclusions is a bit more over positive and over entertaining than its final collapsed in well movie spirit seems being similar to a beautiful life producers or more recent one of levi s hitler as a comedy hero of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only,positive

it embarrases me that i a music man have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie my wife rented it from a hasting s video store back when dvds were not widely distributed i was in awe of the movie as it ended because i had no clue what to expect and i wasn t expecting much anyway richard dreyfuss plays the role of glenn holland a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income \( he calls it a fall back position \) while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous his first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded but he finds his way into the students hearts the movie begins in the early 1960s and rock n roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape most of the students of course love the new music realizing he has an in with the students he makes an accurate comparison by playing bach s minuet in g \( for anna magdalena \) and asking the students what song it is they reply it is the lovers concerto by the toys \( what color is the rain that falls softly on my window \) he notes they are wrong and that it is actually the same song \( although he doesn t note that bach s is in 3 4 and the toys in 4 4 \) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the dorian scale he now has them right where he wants them along the way he continues to work on his masterpiece but life a new baby who turns out to be deaf and the need for new things put his life on hold as he notes by quoting john lennon life is what happens while you re making other plans \( or some facsimile thereof \) years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher he has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football he has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous yet he always comes back to the simple rock n roll to make his point about real music but reality plays hide and seek sometimes he has it out with his wife about their deaf son and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night john lennon is killed over time they become friends and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he hears the music but another reality awaits education budget cuts and here dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect the day they cut the football budget in this state well that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it it is in the presence of his now good friend jay thomas \( the football coach \) that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do the music track in this movie is awesome there s just one thing i m still trying to figure out how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it,positive

hank chinaski can t hold a job can t hold a woman can t control his alcoholism and can t make a decent friend because he wallows with the dregs of society chinaski is the lowest of the semi functioning drunks barely able to keep himself in seedy hotels and in liquor unfortunately the movie doesn t hold much interest besides seedy bars and seedy people chinaski s struggles as a writer are only touched upon and not delved into there s no budding poet or tragic talent underlying his alcoholism the closest he comes to poetics imho is where he tells his ex boss openly that he really needs his last check typed out now because he needs to get drunk factotum is saved only by the acting and the ability of the costume designer to turn matt dillon \( hank \) lili taylor \( jan \) and marisa tormei \( laura \) into sleazy characters who look rode hard and put out wet in each and every scene the script is stilted without any highs or lows to it the movie isn t near as fatalistic as leaving las vegas or as hard hitting as requiem for a dream and without any of the comedic relief from spun the closest comparison would be the jaw stretching yawn fest of drunks even if you love addiction movies like i do or love dillon or tormei that still isn t enough to recommend this movie if curiosity overcomes you as it did me then rent the movie before buying it it s earned two stars for the acting alone have a ball or something else to play with if you rent this it s that boring,negative
as both a big fan of this movie and a film student i feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash this film has a sexy edge to it that many other films in the teen film genre dare to exhibit new best friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night without it actually becoming a reality the house is every girl s dream and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting the acting is far from terrible and it was great to see meredith monroe in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as andie in dawson s creek dominique swain once again puts in an a effort for her role as the cheeky deviant sydney for anyone who loved films like tart and cruel intentions this is the film for you,positive

i think woody allen is the best director currently in the business and i believe his serious themed movies are the reason he excells at making us look at ourselves if i m not mistaken interiors was his first venture into dramatic movies for having led the way this movie is noteworthy however it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the woody allen movie it defines the woody allen film by showing us what it is not woody allen s greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves his characters have faults that we share whatever passions that we have fallen prey to we see them in a new light through allen s masterful script and direction the problem with interiors is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in interiors have many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by ingar bergman allen s own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it taken in its own right interiors is an above average movie the acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner the movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess these people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other woody allen cast \( with the bumbling exception of the cast of what s new pussycat \) woody allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way fortunately he learned from his experience,positive
for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his her dirty secrets covered up i feel that it s the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government don t really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i can t fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i don t feel it s right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values his her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to his her mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it s alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who s rich do we wait until then to change the moral that s pathetic and so is this movie,negative

i saw this movie and i found it both shocking and choking it displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars \( yes the cigarettes and the smoke were real not cg \) i think they should have omitted such scenes from the script because it displays a behavior that s not only illegal in several countries but also threatening to both society and childhood no matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie i give it a disgusting 1 and this is the last movie i ever watch that depicts smoking children to those that haven t yet watched this movie please don t watch it unless you want cancer to win the health wars and here i hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker if you want to depict smoking children use computer graphics instead of the real thing,negative
i was disappointed with this longer version of the mill on the floss i thought being bbc and a long version it would be a definitive one but i have to agree with the other reviewer this version left out some very important events and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving i like long movies but this dragged because it just doesn t hold your attention the 1997 masterpiece theatre version is so much more powerful and keeps all important events intact spending less time on maggie s mother worrying about the fate of her china and more on character and plot development with a very haunting score i really hope the other version is released on dvd if so i will probably donate this one to the library because i can t quite see myself rewatching it i would rather read the book instead,negative

what an incredible waste of acting talent there was a crooked man turned out to be director joseph mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as all about eve and the barefoot contessa should be embarrassed by this bomb kirk douglas plays paris pittman jr a charming persuasive prisoner incarcerated in territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him 500 000 he hid the loot prior to his capture it s presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status newly appointed warden woodrow lopeman played by henry fonda is trying to use douglas influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform under the guise of playing along with fonda douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash with an excellent cast including hume cronyn burgess meredith and lee grant i expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered,negative
i like this video for it s frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself like yoga it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it the energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches the quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm i found that in itself very interesting and different it is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like she shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing a mind bender so to speak and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it,positive
some scenes are repeated from the first it is not that bad thats all i can say i think i over rated it with 2 stars too many,negative
the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there s no mystery,negative

jennifer jason can someone puhleeze tell me why she always plays the same role and why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution the so called bostonish or upper crust east coast accent does not include slurring your words as if a consonant was too much work it as if her upper lip is never engaged at all not even to smirk does she have a botox complex use your face including your upper lip but then again maybe she was acting just like dorothy parker who ahem happens to be dead \( no disrespect intended \) jennifer beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance why didn t she play parker i believed her character gwyneth love her bit part but she added a much needed warmth to the film i cared for one character and the best part was his bit giving a financial report i thought that was brilliant bravo but mr benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character thank you will someone please make this film over and do it right and don t just call up your buds for a tupperware party and say hey lets make a movie dorothy parker deserves much much better i can t even imagine the biting remarks she would print how about it s all about me and i hated it but the costumes were nice,negative
not what i expected when renting this movie as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent futhermore i don t understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world everyone knows what lovelace has done there are numerous accounts yet she goes with him anyway blah the acting was ok the costumes were excellent \( i love period movies \) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged and as another put it i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket i read a lot of historical fiction classic novels and love period movies but there was no liking this one it just couldnt be done,negative
dennis leary is hailed as some great angry young man who is trying to bring the world to rights personally i prefer bill hicks at least when bill did it he was being original dennis leary has in my opinion nicked bill hicks act in a similar way to how i feel about joss stone compared to proper soul artists sitting in front of a few live videos of a great man and taking notes does not mean you will ever be one dennis definately a must have for anyone who enjoys covers bands stick to the acting dennis,negative
therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages 13 14 15 16 and 17 cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood s boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon s neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run of the mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she s not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip s request knowing nothing but trip s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick \( of course \) but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines \( such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation \) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future,negative

before i review i d like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show and so i figured eventually i d have to get around to seeing the movie which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they re both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name \( which i have not read so i don t know which is more accurate \) but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way there are many things i don t like about this movie the biggest being poor pacing the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler but that s the biggest problem there s not really enough story to last a full length feature because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short and since they didn t have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes \( there are barely any and they aren t very impressive for the most part \) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won t understand more than 60 of and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we re looking at either nothing or a woman s nipples that s not cinematic artistry that s being either lazy or perverted the animation itself isn t even that good especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago it s choppy and there s not really a whole lot of detail \( except when it comes to women s nipples \) looking at just the animation if i didn t know better i d have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980 s the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell it s probably kind of like how i didn t see the 1989 batman movie until years after i d been spoiled by batman the animated series and couldn t bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman everything about the tv series is superior to this movie the animation the stories the character developement the production values i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is in short if you re you re at all interested in the gits franchise do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead you ll find a lot to love but i can t say the same about the movie my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex,negative
the story of alice in wonderland was controversial from the moment that the reverend charles lutwidge dodgson aka lewis carroll wrote it some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy others consider alice s journey as a trip into or through insanity for better or worse disney did capture many of these elements and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film however there are also those who loved the books and loved the film normally i recommend disney classis without reservations in the case of this movie i will keep a couple of provisos alice is a young girl bored by her lessons as the length of the lessons grows alice soon drifts off until a white rabbit passes by muttering to himself that he is late alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever luckily for alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent once at the bottom of the hole alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small however there is a vial labeled drink me that alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation indeed alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film even the fundamental basis of alice s journey through wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies the ending of alice s journey in particular is quite frightening especially to younger children embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares i remember seeing alice in wonderland as a child and i remember i thought the ending was scary and i was relieved when alice was able to escape back to the normal world given that this film is well over fifty years old i was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does the smoke did negatively affect alice as it made her cough perhaps there is an object lesson for children here while some consider many of the references to allude to drugs i think that is a modern interpretation i think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use remember that this story was first published in 1869 i believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by disney for all these provisos this film is excellent it matches fantasia in its surreal visions and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb the animation is marvelous as well readily illustrating the vision of alice s journey this movie is one of those rare disney films that i am unable to recommend to all viewers whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste if you enjoy animation oriented toward adults then you may find this animation a treat if you are open minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated you may also find that you enjoy it i do recommend this movie for slightly older children perhaps 8 and above considering some of the disturbing images good luck,positive

pushing the envelope for explicit over the counter home videos 9 songs \( tartan \) is about one year of sex and rock n roll in the life of two lovers matt is a young glaciologist he meets lisa at a london rock concert that night they start an affair in between attending more concerts they make passionate love it s for real and explicit nine live concert song footage is intercut with their coke snorting sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship and finally all this takes place in the memory of matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the south pole this unscripted film is part musical part drama part documentary and part performance it raises questions about the difference between pornography and art controversial and much buzzed about this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been and of course the sex a special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances,negative
a dismal disappointment i think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy when i see the high ratings i wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product the original lonesome dove mini series was unbelievably well done a complete multifaceted joy i was so excited when i saw there was a sequel and the joy of lonesome dove would continue well it didn t and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings,negative
let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even boring to my friends so it isn t the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me it isn t the unresolved ending that bothered me it wasn t the violence \( in short bursts \) it wasn t the acting \( the acting was pretty good actually \) but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure i didn t care who was sending the tapes and i didn t care what would happen with the main characters they were unrelatable on just about any level this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3 4 s of the way in and you ll think wow i wonder where the story will go next and then it doesn t that was it very disappointing i don t mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there s some kinda payoff in the end i really don t understand all the acclaim that this movie got as a suspense movie or as an art film it fails pretty miserably the premise was a good idea that went nowhere slowly viewer beware,negative

i used to have respect for bill maher he used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies but not anymore my respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for gwb and religion i watched i m swiss once and almost couldn t refrain from vomiting he talks about the usual suspects the president religion obesity same sex marriage rap and few other things that comedians are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about i know i know he s not a liberal he s a libertarian well i have watched and listened to bill maher and i know which side he s on most of the time and it sure isn t on the right he hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time i don t know why his panties are in such a bunch being organized is better than being disorganized \( i can tell jokes too \) i m not religious and i can t help but see much of it as hard to swallow but i m not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders i wasn t there when the bible was written or when the events took place i can t say it s all fairtyales i can only say some of it isn t logical but i respect religion and its purposes which is what separates me from him he has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion which are both things that make life more bearable for them the purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation the same purpose of drugs i might add something maher not only defends but abuses why the double standard this is no longer the eleventh century where protestants are killing catholics the only people k illing in the name of religion are fanatical muslims but most religious people are good decent nonviolent individuals maher s not an atheist but he has recently expressed a could be could be not attitude toward the existence of a g od which would make him agnostic but one thing is for sure atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does two of our biggest mass murderers hitler and stalin were atheist it s a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than maher who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one most of the time he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself i laughed twice during the entire show no one has ever accused maher of being modest he s a smug intellectual elitist and those are his good qualities i m swiss displays this all too clearly in case you didn t know i m swiss is a running joke of maher s embarrassment of being an american he d rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for not an extension of morality where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all where adultery is seen as cute not sinful where there are no fat people where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions thank god i live in america and not switzerland,negative

this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film and has many flaws a silly plot cheap religious imagery \( dracula is judas jeez louise \) and not one truly sexy or scary moment and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula s brides including jennifer esposito jeri ryan if you can t make a film sexy with these two you re in the wrong business craven has an over inflated rep as a director he doesn t deserve any rep as a producer if this leaden film is a sample it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison save your money and pick up something scary instead like bava s black sunday or any hammer horror,negative
this is one of the best \( if not the best \) pure screwball comedies of the 1930 s next to the original thin man movie libeled lady is my favorite powell loy effort this time the magic chemistry of that oft paired duo is enhanced by the box office drawing talents of fellow mega stars spencer tracy and jean harlow the first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four top drawer actors merrily confidently stride arm in arm toward the camera the plot is convoluted the star has erroneously printed a story about heiress connie allenbury \( myrna loy \) portraying her as a marriage wrecker connie immediately files a 5 million dollar libel suit star newspaper editor warren haggerty \( spencer tracy \) counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman bill chandler \( william powell \) to romance connie and place her in a compromising position thus negating the lawsuit haggerty convinces his harried long suffering fiancee gladys benton \( jean harlow \) to instead marry the bachelor chandler as part of the scheme things get really tricky when gladys falls for chandler and chandler falls for connie who eventually falls for chandler and haggerty he pretty much spends the movie just seething yet everything ends fairly well even if there s still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom libeled lady boasts mix ups and complications galore and couples matching cross matching and mismatching sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy delicious acting is laid in by four stars who throughout their film careers never ever lost their prime powell proves again his mastery of the confused double take and along with the wry understated myrna loy dominates the refined repartees and representing the more lowbrow couple tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and harlow the affronted looks walter connolly as connie s angling loving father is simply wonderful the intricate storyline is easy to follow thanks to the clear helmsmanship of jack conway with this cinematic venture hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars i think it s brilliant stuff,positive
i ll give the leads the benefit of the doubt that they re actually a lot better than this lame o flick deserves kutcher and murphy are tom and sara the mismatched couple that loves itself to pieces in this story which strains for laughs after a whirlwind romance sara introduces tom to her tony beverly hills family they marry and the rest \( much like their marriage \) is quickly history things go bad from the wedding night \( bloody noses no sex \) and only get worse after tom nearly burns down the french chalet that sara booked them into \( after a fatal misunderstanding involving voltage differences in europe and an electric sex toy \) and compounds problems by taking them to the worst hotel in venice \( cockroaches dust and no sex \) our heroes quickly realize that they are on the honeymoon from hell at first they gamely make a go of it not realizing that they re only saving their tension for the perfect moment just married was a simple idea for a flick people have been laughing at marriage for years maybe that s why the jokes seem forced the sex toy fiasco painfully illustrates how far the script will go to get a laugh and we get that one early on every joke is actually half of a joke about sara and tom can t have sex climaxing \( really no pun intended i mean it \) when sara tricks custom s inspectors into giving her hated hubby a full rectal exam \( cut to the scene of tom walking bow legged onto the plane obviously he s the victim but in the perverse logic of this unsexual non comedy you ve got to wonder whether tom is actually the victor he at least got some \) the script can t get past a monumental plot gap tom and sara really don t have anything in common you d think they d have learnt and gotten past their foibles while they dated but the story skips past much of that tom s the hero but he s an idiot the script makes him out as the ugly american an utterly dated cliche \( he s surprised that nobody in europe watches american baseball he s the kind of idiot who uses american instead of english when referring to language as in why isn t there a sign in american warning against using us voltage sex toys in france the laughs are far and few in between the best ones involve cars \( both the ridiculous sub compact they rent in france and the dodge barracuda \( at least i think it s a cuda \) that tom drives a monster which was probably meant to remind us about that 70 s show but which looks like a prop from the phantasm movies if ever there was a flick that needed help from the tall man this is it,negative
if you can t get enough of zombie comedies this year i seriously recommend this one made in the czech republic of all places i saw it at the tribeca film festival \( ny \) and it was tremendous fun bloody funny and smart an intellectual twist on the secluded retreat idea a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives and of course they re overrun by zombies i especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore fest it works on so many different levels while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes the interesting characters and the joyful way it plays with film conventions this is a rare and unusual film to come out of the czech republic i was disappointed that it didn t get a theatrical release in the us so i m really glad that it s coming out on dvd humor horror fans will not be disappointed,positive
leeches is a terrible movie dude i have never seen anything so gay in my whole life \( except the director s other film speed demon \) when the guys were less clothes than the gals thats not a good sign the video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director s work they re all filled with loads of homoeroticism women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks the roided up leeches enter their male victims through anal orrifices after watching about a half hour of this mess i had to turn it off why does this guy fool people into renting these movies i don t mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it s time to draw the line no hetro relationships in this one just the director molesting his male stars with his camera horrible stuff stay away from david decoteau s work and his fifty different aliases \( unless you know what you re in for \),negative

this was a subject of much conversation when i was deployed to saudi arabia and it s still a favorite with most military and civilians in iraq ground hog day is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same until finally the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it s the day you leave the movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique bill murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well it s fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here,positive
collateral damage is the great and partially real action film in which arnold schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall with the attacks on sept 11 movies have tried to cash in but collateral damage is different arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview with byron allen the movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks basically the fbi and cia tell gorden brewer \( arnold schwarzennger \) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family when in fact they have no good leads on the suspect rather than sitting on his butt and waiting for the fbi to do something gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family by going into columbia and getting the wolf \( cliff curtis \) as the terrorist is called there is a great scene in which gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their collateral damage the radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims i loved this scene because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead he probably has no family of his own and doesn t know the meaning of life except to cover his own now you might say to yourself what s the difference between arnold s character \( who is going for justice \) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from arnold himself the difference between me and you is that i am only going to kill you unbelievable action and twists at the end that you re literally be on the edge of youre seat and just when you think the movie is over it s not director andrew davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on columbia but also a factual based type movie that deals with terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don t happen again in fact most people will remember the horrible case of wall street reporter daniel pearl who was executed after the u s failed to meet the demands of the middle east terrorist holding the u s should have gone after these terrorists like the way arnold does in this movie but then the u s does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970 s the u s supported and backed up madmen like general pinochet in chile and dictator samoza in nicaragua both of them killed hundreds of people with u s backing and funding still though collateral damage is a great action film that you must see,positive
well not to bad a deal most of the movies here aren t too bad \( the inspector general a farewell to arms a star is born etc \) and have basically clear picture and sound quality it s true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good there is a problem with this set however after you ve watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and i discovered this when we wanted to watch the flying deuces for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue my advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale very cheap and to just rent some of the better ones we did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered buster keaton w c fields and charlie chaplin because of this for instance \( and after we liked father s litle dividend we decided to watch father of the bride which was even better \) so i have decided to give it an extra star just for that,negative
you can tell your life is really pathetic when ghosts have to show you how to live but that is what happens to cosmo topper in the charming topper and its equally charming sequel topper returns it s basically your typical screwball comedy \( complete with cary grant \) but with an injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery in other words it s loads of fun george and marion kirby \( cary grant constance bennett \) love fun partying until clubs kick them out and generally not taking life seriously so it s a shock to them when they die in a car accident and linger on as ghosts apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the great beyond so when george s boss cosmo topper \( roland young \) crashes his new car in the same spot the kirbys take him under their wing poor cosmo is stodgy and timid with a domineering wife who schedules his day down to the minute so it s up to the kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun but their good deed rapidly gets away from them and most sequels stink but goofy murder mystery topper returns is just as funny as the first movie instead of a ghostly screwball this time it s a spoof of haunted house stories with a nod to hitchcock s rebecca ann carrington \( carole landis \) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance with cheeky pal gail \( joan blondell \) in tow but after the girls switch bedrooms someone murders gail confused she drifts over to the house of cosmo topper \( roland young \) whose car she hijacked earlier in the day gail blackmails topper into helping her discover who murdered her and who is trying to kill ann now the unfortunate topper must somehow solve the mystery despite a small army of creepy servants a house full of secret passages and vicious seals and his upset wife searching high and low for him based on thorne smith s novels topper and topper returns even had a spinoff tv series which was nowhere near as good as the movies and those movies are charming and still fresh especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories but it s the little touches that make this movie hilarious for example there s george laughing on a chandelier and gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body not to mention that vicious seal the comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film but no less entertaining but at the same time these movies are graced by tender moments between george and marion and a truly exquisite scene where gail s ghost wanders out the window into the sky and i m still not sure how that invisible person under the covers shot was done especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s roland young is the star of the piece his topper is timid halting and has his day scheduled down to the minute not a single spark of sponteneity grant comes across like a trickster god and has wonderful chemistry with bennett and blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl topper and topper returns are decades old but are perfect examples of hollywood classics charming chipper and hilarious,positive
i watched this with my parents and didn t like marlons mouth reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something he cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far what is cool about that that whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school and my neighborhood the rest of the movie was all right but marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity sorry that s just my opinion,negative
the slick stylish spanish thriller nobody knows anybody is set in seville during holy week in the year 2000 newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would be writer simon cardenas \( eduardo noriega \) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word adversary as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue since the message also contained threats simon does what he s told and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events directed by mateo gil nobody knows anything opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory the film which owes much of its style to american thrillers is slickly produced and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of seville help but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience i was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot however once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear \( and i can t give away too much here \) the film became silly and trite there s little character development our hero is a flat dull passive character and the film s emphasis is on the thrill aspect a slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous this film is in spanish with english subtitles displacedhuma,negative

i had two choices watching this movie smile or laugh out loud when i wasn t smiling i was laughing keaton s the general is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered the story line is simple but what keaton does with it is genius johnny gray \( buster keaton \) is an engineer for the western and atlantic railroad he has two loves his engine the general and annabelle lee \( marion mack \) a fine southern belle when war starts johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected he s more valuable to the south as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier trouble is nobody tells him why he was rejected worse annabelle thinks he may be a coward and tells him she doesn t want to see him again until he is in uniform just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the general and take it north destroying bridges and lines along the way while a northern army moves south unknowingly annabelle lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped johnny sees the general chugging away and races after it determined to bring back the general when he realizes annabelle lee is held captive his resolve knows to bounds for the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest fastest funniest chase movies ever filmed keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point and when he rescues annabelle and realizes how hopeless her southern belle helplessness can be his exasperation is matched only by his love the general features a big cast a major battle fleeing armies a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge keaton s timing and inventiveness are legendary so is his risk taking he does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous in one he is lying back on the engine s cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward in the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks keaton has another railroad tie in his hands at the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as keaton on the cow catcher passes this scene has no cutting the two ties fly off as high as keaton s head he could have been killed instead we laugh it s amazing that in his older years keaton could still walk his body took incredible punishment for the laughs try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties his ingenuity is extraordinary how do you build excitement out of an extended train chase both engines are behemoths and are on the same track they can t pass each other keaton does it with endless bits of business in fact he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split second timing what makes keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn t do double takes he barely reacts but he s no stone face keaton s characters are simply very serious fellows things happen to them his characters don t react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions this edition of the general comes from kino video and looks good it includes two keaton short films the playhouse \( 1921 \) and cops \( 1922 \) in the playhouse keaton portrays all the members of the cast orchestra and audience in a stage show including nine members of a minstrel act the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp in cops he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another,positive

i found the film malice to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery sure there are a lot of twist s in the film however that is what i found to be very good about this film especially the way these twist s were done there will be no spoilers in this review the film begin s with murders occuring in a small college town andy safian \( bill pullman \) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings all circumstantial moreover he is having problems with his wife \( nicole kidman \) something happens to her and she blames andy for this to tell you would give away the film it seems as if one of andy s old school friends is now a practicing surgeon \( alec baldwin \) therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief and the doctor \( balwin \) in particular who caused this grief to her but there is more to the story than meets the eye there are several stories going on at once first you have a serial killer secondly you have a distraught wife \( kidman \) blaming her ex husband and his doctor friend for what has happened to her but there is more to her than the viewer suspect s i will leave this to you to discover the film is better than the reviews warrant it is a very suspenseful film full of twists recommended,positive
first off let me say that i know next to nothing about art i would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork but it certainly does not come naturally especially when it comes to modern art dali however is a master i at least have some affinity with who doesn t know of the melting clocks i have also seen the dream sequence he created for hitchcock s film spellbound in 1945 plus the guy was just plain weird and that is something i know a little bit about myself this artists of the 20th century dvd looks solely at dali s artwork all you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another there is no biographical look at the man no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality \( or mustache \) there is not even an adequate identification of gala his inspiration and muse despite numerous references to her in his paintings thus this dvd will not introduce you to dali the man or dali the artist it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro dali s artwork is obviously impressive and i was surprised by the variety of his work and styles the narrator offers insight into some paintings others you just look and advance i don t understand a lot of dali s work nor can i see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces the melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me dark works such as visage of war speak volumes to the human observer and the disappearing bust of voltaire paintings are also striking i was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces dali painted however largely because i did not know he ever produced such works my idea of a painting equates with something like design for the interior decoration of a stable library which is a strikingly beautiful work is this dvd worth watching i will have to say no if you re a know nothing novice like me there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown if you re knowledgeable about dali you ll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite dali works excluded from the show after watching this i decided to peruse some dali galleries online and i must say that the internet makes this dvd of little value not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the dvd,negative
i was just surfing the shelves at borders today when i stumbled over queen kelly on dvd i couldn t believe it i have just been getting interested in silent films \( i m 18 \) and of course i m a gloria swanson fan \( who isn t \) having seen her brilliant performance in sunset blvd anyway i had always heard rumors about queen kelly the incomplete forgotten masterpiece i had to pay a whopping money for this dvd but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny first of all this film is old you can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well let s just say the music is annoyingly intense but the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch the story takes place in the 20s but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago now i want to concentrate on the story and the performances gloria swanson s performance in queen kelly has to be one of her best she was every bit as good in this film as in sunset blvd we can easily see why she was such a huge silent star her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story this was really melodrama at its best people tend to forget i think that melodrama can be an art form stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism the main event here is the story wow it s tragic that the film \( and the story \) were never finished but who knows it s just begging for a megabucks remake with nicole kidman now that the musicals are back maybe silents will be next,positive
that is what this film meant to me looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by so sweet so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there this film is a poem to paris and the passing of youth with the hope of recapturing that one love which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind always present always remembered always desired the two lovers meet seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier they see how much they meant to eachother how much they still could like two pieces of a puzzle that fit this is a genuinely beautiful film more mature than the last one much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic it opened that sense of mystery that i have known in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy julie delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages she has become a sad person stalled in relationships though she is living up to her ideals ethan hawke is struggling to grow with his success in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly their relationship so brief rings totally true in its humor commitment and occasional awkwardness perhaps this is sentimental but i think i have known love like this it is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago some people simply pierce thru to the heart earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become it is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex \( well maybe not too far beyond \) highest recommendation this succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time with an entire history implied behind it like the greatest art and i do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted which is also so very much like real life,positive
personally i found 8 1 2 to be one of the most boring films i ve ever seen it was a pretentious self indulgent trip down the director s memory lane i understood the plot and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end but overall was bored silly by stilted pointless dialogue having said that the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching perhaps 8 1 2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment p,negative
truth be told i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively when this thing gets going though the descent easily attains not to be missed status and on top of all the incredible special effects oppressive atmosphere and grievous bloodletting \( made with a pretty limited budget by the way \) one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner are you kidding me blood gore a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn t believe and subtlety how could i not give the descent five stars so you ve got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky extreme activity white water rafting for example everyone has fun but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women sarah \( shauna macdonald \) forever still recovering from her terrible loss sarah joins her friend beth \( alex reid \) in america where mutual friend juno \( natalie mendoza \) an alpha female if there ever was one has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored joining in the fun are holly \( nora jane noone \) juno s new gung ho sidekick and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians \( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk \) then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure once they descend into the cave system though things start getting more intense fairly quickly their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses that s when juno a woman with more than her fair share of secrets admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before supposedly to help reunite the group well it does just the opposite but they just have to keep going if there is a way out they re going to have to find it the hard way things are already creepy enough at this point the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets making the viewer feel as if he she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic but the real fun was just about to begin in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you ll ever want to squirm through sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them no one believes her at first when the crawlers attack though all hell breaks loose two miles under ground these gollum like creatures are some kind of blind albino humanoids who hunt by sound can scamper and climb like monkeys move unbelievably quickly and really tear into whatever flesh they can find not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light and when the girls fight back it s cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy bloody gruesome department and even as characters are fighting for their lives a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences didn t get to see the true final scene of the film for some pretty questionable reasons a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference don t worry though as the dvd has both endings available the descent draws deeply from the well of man s most instinctual fears making it one of the most atmospheric heart pounding movies to come along in quite a while the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film and plenty more on top of that if you care the first thing about horror you must see this atmospheric tour de force,positive
they do t make musicals like this anymore well they don t really make musicals anymore do they they used to make them made them well and they came out like down argentine way the plot is just enough to keep your interest but the music is bright costumes lavish and not a few laughts the major players betty grable and don ameche are as engaging as usual carmen miranda makes her us film debut and sings dances and mispronounces her way to stardom the 20th century fox role players appear \( charlotte greenwood j carrol naish henry stephenson \) and add to the fun,positive

my wife really likes martin after listening to this concert i must say it is indeed a very good live presentation,positive
i really enjoyed this dvd and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns the instructor actually starts with the left foot so you can follow her mirror image i teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves and you will work up a sweat if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march enjoy,positive
js concert was the most boring thing i have ever seen on dvd my cat was more interested in watching it then i was and that was only because of jessica s frilly costumes the sound system stank i was expecting her voice to echo like crazy all of jessica s songs were about expressing her love for nick this dvd is so boring i m falling asleep just trying to figure out what to say about it oh yeah her vocals were too breathy that pink thing she wore looked like a flamingo caught in a shredder and she should have left take my breath away alone nick didn t take her breath away she took his when she decided to walk out of their marriage nick will be siniging i m taking half away and jessica will be singing i should have prenup,negative
i wouldn t recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone due to a high content of bad words screaming and violence it s kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else some people really enjoyed it and that s not me and that s not the other two people i know who watched it some violent parts are a bit hard to believe but i guess that s what the story is about this movie is a bit of a hollywood style suspense with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies there s one good idea in this movie and that s how life develops as it goes along and one action or inaction changes how life plays out but this is no where near original even the simpsons had an episode like that so this movie is definitely not on my best movies list,negative
martin short is priceless in this movie i enjoyed every minute,positive
pro great story teriffic acting beautiful setting con some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style \( and culture \) are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character s lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film,positive
unable to view because of incompatible format \( as you warned me \) however my ancestor james mclintock of barnsley yorkshire england sent john wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film \( which is why i wanted the dvd \) so,negative
this movie is intimate and special some reviews say it is the story of obsession of fetishism of trivial things however this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy s life his fantasy woman the character malena rarely speaks throughout the movie but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young love this perspective makes her ideal and special with few flaws as a fantasy woman is to a young man malena is instantly a likeable character not awful and disgusting like those using her we cannot forget that our narrator renato is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story therefore he is unreliable as a narrator malena s sins are washed clean through his judgement and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women however renato has had years to think about everything to contemplate what really happened to her so in the end the people who use her are completely despicable unable to garner any liking of course she is a victim but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men the movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems she is from another city and her husband for most of the movie is dead yet she chooses to not escape but to stay and her fate is sealed the music in the movie was nominated for best score in 2000 and it is beautiful emotional it truly adds to the feeling of the movie i would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story emotion and characters you will never forget this movie,positive
the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars this set was poorly put together the shorts included are quite random and buying this set would be a waste of money each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters first there is alfalfa then buckwheat spanky darla porky mickey stymie then fatty oh wait no that is joe cobb only they didn t know his real name then farina and last phil macmahon who you may be asking phil macmahon the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938 still don t know him maybe that is because he wasn t a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot it is one of my favorite shorts from the series however it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races the films themselves are very good disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents it is a total disaster just like in reunion in rhythm one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry the film has been seriously cut there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores but it works there are sound effects too sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train it is a very cute film farina is especially funny in it the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video s soundtracks the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship when it sinks they find a real one to destroy this short has also been cut there is no opener for it either it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it disk three opens with mary queen of tots it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang she dreams they come to life and when she wakes up she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters the print on this one is not bad at all the last film is school s out a talkie featuring a different cast it is a film featuring miss crabtree the new teacher the picture is good it seems to be the one from cabin fever disk four begins with bear shooters this is a less than great film the print is great it is the one from cabin fever our gang follies of 1938 is a great film very funny long and exciting it features the later talkie cast waldo s last stand is a film from the later mgm years a lesser film that seems forced it was also released in a 5 part rascals set disk five is the extra features dvd it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show on it some of the silent gang are reunited joe cobb jackie condon farina hoskins johnny downs and mickey daniels are featured the documentary called kid stuff really doesn t have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview other child stars like jackie coogan judy garland shirley temple roddy mcdowall and ron howard are focused on as well the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain many of them have been available cheaply for years the only reason a fan might want to see this collection the same reason i bothered was to see the rarer silent films however the rest of the set is trash,negative
when i first put this dvd in i noticed that they cut away the opening then the movie starts and i can t believe my eyes as the quality of the dvd is even lower than my vcd version this is just frustrating to watch the subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can t even be read another thing is the audio you can t switch between cantonese and mandarin like on my vcd yes this too was fixed to cantonese only there is no extra features you might as well buy a vhs tape which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality it does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused vhs tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting customers \( read victims \),negative
my objection was the implication that the stars played a part in the film i felt that the picture was completely deceptive ms richards and ms hanna had less than 15 minutes \( maybe a little more but not much and possible even less \) and were clearly there to fool the viewer it was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary,negative
how families fall apart and mend themselves is the point of this star laden 1996 movie but stage and tv director jerry zaks screenwriter scott mcpherson and a trio of fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with something more resonant based on a play by mcpherson before he succumbed to aids the semi autobiographical plot focuses on two estranged middle aged sisters in florida mousey spinster bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father marvin and their eccentric aunt ruth in ohio lee escaped family responsibility to get married and raise two sons in ohio only to see things fall apart lee is on the verge of turning her life around as a licensed cosmetologist when bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and reaches out to lee and her sons as potential bone marrow transplant candidates the rest of the movie is mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable intriguingly while the soap opera elements are strictly by the numbers there is a persistent undercurrent of black comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of the piece it also helps that meryl streep and diane keaton play the sisters as the embittered guilt ridden lee streep moves easily back into blue collar silkwood territory and she unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her self centered character however it s a vanity free keaton who really radiates as bessie finding inner strength and contentment under increasingly dire circumstances a year before titanic leonardo di caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile hellions as lee s oldest son hank a textbook example of teenaged pyromaniac angst the rest of the cast is fine in limited turns robert deniro \( one of the producers as well \) as the bumbling dr wally dan hedaya as his even more pixilated brother bob gwen verdon as wild eyed soap opera obsessed aunt ruth hal scardino as hank s self controlled little brother charlie and hume cronyn who is forced to play marvin with severely limited expression there are predictable moments throughout but some surprise and a few actually enthrall including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when bessie recalls the drowning death of her open mouthed carny boyfriend there are no extras with the 1999 dvd release,positive
i bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that i never got past the first 20 minutes i am not a prude but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff i put the video in my recycle box maybe it had some substance but i could not get past the first 20 minute,negative

flashdance with jennifer beals is such a 80 s icon movie and not only that but it has a amazing soundtrack to follow alex played by jennifer is a trying to start a career as a dancer but has no experience from any dance school so she wants to impress a bunch of dance people to let her in their school the movie has great scencic views and has great songs from a amazing soundtrack jennifer lopez s song i m glad has a flashdance theme so if you ever get the chance check out that video if you love your 80 movies then rent this one tonight,positive
there are enough reviews of the main movie story so i don t need to add anything in that regard but what on earth does a lesbian sub story \( in both regards \) have to do with the story as a whole nothing so we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue grass music and the appalachian way of life that instead heads for the trash bin,negative
the best cleopatra that the movies has ever produced be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part so many came before and so many after elizabeth taylor however to me cleopatra will always be elizabeth taylor a mega movie with fantastic costumes and acting is a classic in historic movies if you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection,positive

i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it i heard that it was the most violent film ever made i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better i was dead wrong cannibal ferox is a boring unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys the few gore scenes are pretty effective but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws if it was for giovanni lombardo radice one of my favorite italian horror actors starring in it cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star,negative

black hawk down hasn t got an interesting story on offer when a bunch of marines is stranded in mogadishu somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them from there it is just angry men running and shooting although this is what you would expect from a war movie black hawk down remains way below average i think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns as this movie was based on events that truly took place probably americans will appreciate black hawk down a little more \( sarr \),negative
my two year old only child adores this dvd so much that she s adopted max as an imaginary younger brother there s no flash and no dash no special effects and no tired slapstick but there is charm gentleness intelligence humor and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life my daughter views max and ruby as such a treat that i used it as a potty training reward and she s always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it ages 18 months through five five stars and then some,positive

a broad range of jewish related topic movies varies from trembling before the g d to the holy land where jewish humor emphasis on the holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of of course modern israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day by day israeli reality incorporating h o h m e s \( sarcastic jokes \) if necessary something more linking to a secular modern american reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex bent traditionally characteristic inter religious confession gesheft \( profit \) pieces of gay lesbian adultery quickie drug secular hasidic traces of affairs which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly sorry it is definitely not my cap of tea if even this play is r rated,negative
the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason the point of kundera s writing is not his plot or even his characters but his style for instances his endless digressions about history politics and philosophy for the movie we are left with nothing but plot and character ok what is one to do that in itself wouldn t be so bad if i didn t watch the film with the constant thought i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie this is a slow film it takes an hour and a half story and takes three hours to tell it i can t recommend the film,negative
i am from australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to amazon is a complete season of baywatch really baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing i don t think so not only have the distributors done fans no favours but amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast on the amazon website as part of advertising for season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it if you go by the cast that amazon have put on you would think that it was the real original season 1 when we know it is not the release in the uk which is out now and the upcoming release in australia on march 14th is the real deal season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct there are no episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal aaro,negative

saw hart s war the other night and couldn t really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one this film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days here are ten reasons why 1 this film isn t the great escape and even though he would probably like to think otherwise bruce willis isn t steve mcqueen even though willis received top billing this is a colin farrell vehicle 2 the vast majority of the target audience of 18 34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the reagan administration much less world war ii hart s war may just as well be a film about a pow camp during the war of 1812 anything with vin diesel or the rock would be bound to sell more tickets 3 as far as depicting life in a pow camp hart s war is pretty much on par with hogan s heroes the germans are nice guys with guns who don t know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything where did the gi s get all those cigarettes anyway 4 any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him as depicted in hart s war the camp commandant \( as portrayed by marcel lures \) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army his collection of american jazz blues records is a cute writer s invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps in reality the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic 5 the storyline is not completely unbelievable trials did take place in pow camps one good example being the pow s who were tried and hung in andersonville however the whole idea that the camp s commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous 6 the idea that during the trial a group of pow s who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions the german army simply wasn t that stupid 7 i saw this film once and didn t like it i thought that maybe the second time would be better it wasn t 8 beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness hart s war seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which for most pow s was just day to day survival also the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans weren t spineless hapless dopes 9 bruce willis playing the same role in variations of die hard over and over and over again is tiring 10 better films about the same sort of subject matter are the tuskeegee airmen and stalag 17 hopefully in a few years hart s war will be completely forgotten and these dvd s will be rotting in some landfill,negative

a film that s a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism since nothing is as it seems we may as well be inside a fictionalized world like the unicorn story the main character cathryn is writing this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination however the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem \( hugh is played by rene rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn \) insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance,positive
i just watched mommie dearest for the first time tonight as most critics and fans of mommie dearest acknowledge the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse with such an over dramatic \( but entirely true to life \) performance by faye dunaway it was both hilarious and depressing i m 30 and didn t know much about joan crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being classic camp seems to me crawford was probably bi polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder i think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to she knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do whether it was having a successful marriage a happy family or even giving to charity her life was a running commercial directed by hollywood not unlike the tabloid driven image obsessed hollywood we have today despite the often times hilarious image of her and her sibling s victimization on film christina s abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life christina crawford was completely justified turning her mother s image on its head with her book and movie yes the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering after all what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh mocking the unexplained unjustified pain you experienced in the past renders it powerless to harm your future this is the legacy of mommie dearest whatever joan crawford really was,positive
i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it s year of release 1986 prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of purple rain both the film and the soundtrack and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal which is what they did to prince in those days many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip they couldn t believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn t trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy of course poor critical response alone doesn t usually keep the public from making a movie popular yet under the cherry moon was a bomb at he box office probably the main reason for this is that the movie although shot in color was released in black and white for some unfathomable reason the general movie going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black and white movie now don t get me wrong i m not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves i m only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color i will acknowledge that this movie s target audience is prince fans since i am one myself and have been most of my life i m not the most entirely objective viewer but i make no apologies for my love of this movie it s not a guilty pleasure for me because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release and unfotunately i missed it in theaters \( i couldn t get anyone to take me i was only 12 and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents though my dad went with me a few years later to see grafitti bridge on opening night but that s for another review \) but since it s dvd release in 2004 this has become one of my most watched discs in my collection the soundtrack is killer the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever there s even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn t make the album \( some of which was issued on 12 vinyl \) plus i think the movie looks great the cinematographer was michael ballhaus who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit \( and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics \) i wonder how the movie would feel in color but i do think black and white was the right way to go even though the movie is set in then contemporary times it has the feel of something from the 30s there are so many classic moments in this movie i won t try to list them all but here are a few christopher tracy \( prince \) giving his bela lugosi eyes tricky \( jerome benton \) tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery the wreka stow scene the car race between christopher and mary sharon \( kristen scott thomas \) as for the acting i ve heard a lot of people saying that prince s performance was no good i don t see much truth in that claim after being so serious in purple rain it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side \( as in purple rain \) i m surprised jerome hasn t done much additional acting outside of prince movies and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this her first major role to become an oscar nominated highly repected leading lady how is the dvd presentation pretty good for such a largely overlooked movie the widescreen transfer and 2 0 stereo mix aren t anything phenomenal but get the job done nonetheless the movie looks and sounds fine as for features anyone expecting a full blown special edition like the 2 disc purple rain will be disappointed but at least it s not a completely bare bones release four music videos are included though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio visual quality \( though they are passable i would ve preferred 5 1 mixes \) the highlight is the live performance of anotherlover which was taken from a never released \( at least not domestically not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u s \) concert video documenting the parade tour mtv held an interesting \( i e very weird \) contest to determine where under the cherry moon would have it s world premiere the ten thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere which would be held in their hometown mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party and unlike the premiere of purple rain unfortunately this program is not to be found on under the cherry moon s dvd release lisa barber was the contest winner and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan wyoming a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan prince summed it up with a single word purple,positive
i have several kathy smith videos this is the absolute worse i agree with some of the other reviewers that kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated also it seems like there a too many people in such a small space the whole set looks very chaotic i wonder if kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself it is very poor all those crazy shuffle moves any other kathy smith workout will be better for you than this one,negative

but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one and alpha video the distributors of this classic capra movie made no attempt to clean it up here we have an example of a key artwork about america s psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves,positive
i saw this flick when it first came out and was chilled to the bone it was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about new york city as well as a cold impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up over 35 years later on review it is still one of the scariest movies ever made the twists are nuanced and plentiful as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating looking for monsters one need only look in the mirror roman polanski was and still is as far as i can tell a master manipulator of perception rosemary s baby is one of his finest films and its timeless theme the struggle between good and evil unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released oh and i braved coming to new york 10 years after the film premiered still here and loving the city i realized eventually of course that new york as in so many films was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold a player in the molding of the film s atmosphere but not the cause it could have been set anywhere and been just as effective,positive

i thought the video was well done it was good to feature the clinching games of the division and league championship series plus all four games of the world sries i think they should have included at least the high lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series against boston and games 1 2 3 and 4 of the league championship series against los angeles still i highly recommend this collection for all gung ho white sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88 years a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights,positive
i owned the vhs version of the wild wild world but decided to get the dvd this winter well that was a great purchase i understand people that could see the documentary of jayne in europe as pretty cheaply made but it is still jayne and if you love her \( as i do \) any film she was in \( except the girl can t help it and will success spoil rock hunter \) was done on the cheap with ridiculously small budgets the wild wild world gives you the chance to see a candid jayne in all kinds of very campy situations and the best scenes are when jayne pretends to be offended by the goings on it shows a jayne mansfield who was indeed a true original rather eccentric person in the anal retentive american fifties i can t help comparing her to what anna nicole smith has done with her career as a media sensation but jayne was doing basically the same fifty years ago which was understandbly much more shocking for the common folks when jayne talks about her film roles you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself i don t understand how she can be compared to marilyn monroe mm was looking for privacy more serious roles spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to when jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about jayne was not too picky about her roles and the kind of attention she was getting and it was her undoing sad but she needed the money to keep up that image all those children dogs and husbands now about the labyrinth of sex it is hysterical and a great choice to make the dvd a double feature just like the good old days of the drive ins when you get over the awful dubbing the documentary is rather well made naive to today s standards of course but well intentionned some viewers will just see crass exploitation but if you are into campy kitsch movies and you see ed wood jr as a genius well you will love it the movie trailers are very funny as well and make you wish you could find them so my conclusion is that dvd is an excellent purchase a must have for any serious jayne mansfield fan,positive
with season 4 the series starts to slide a little i don t think the show is weaker it s just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already look i love the godfather one and two but three is just not as good the total time it takes to watch the first two godfather films is a little over 5 hours that won t even get you through season one of the sopranos i hope i speak for everyone out there when i say that as good as the sopranos is it will never come closed to the godfather movies so i guess it is just starting to get old i will certainly be watching the finale episodes i just hope it isn t too big a let down for those who are interested the dvd set has great transfers but few interesting extras,positive
cursed is the most pathetic werewolf movie i ve seen since an american werewolf in paris the acting is terrible directing is poor \( shame on you mr craven \) and the storyline is largely uncompelling the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience this movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is cool but if you re looking for a scary movie don t look for cursed well at least it s not as bad as an american werewolf in paris but that sure as hell isn t saying much,negative
after enjoying cowboy bebop and samurai champloo someone recommended checking out flcl aka fooly cooly if you enjoyed those previous titles i would suggest steering clear of this particular anime the art is interesting enough but the story is simply lacking the characters are completely and utterly undeveloped it almost seems like they are making fun of you for watching their anime this the second dvd of three and has 40 minutes of programming i read somewhere that this was not even a real show and that they threw it together to test out new animation techniques if you ve seen all 6 episodes and are still wondering what the heck was that this does not seem to be untrue please i strongly suggest you skip watching this program because it is simply put garbage,negative
maybe this is not fair to write a review without even seeing the dvd i wanted to make sure disney understands that people do read these reviews and i am not buying this dvd as swamp fox is incomplete three out of eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase,negative
this movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list overall i was somewhat disappointed with this film i figured there would be a little more real suspense or thrill but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events the biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between eastwood and russo it was contrived lame and almost laughable i had to rub my eyes to make sure i wasnt having a nightmare john malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves clint eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self no problem here though clint was solid the film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end the climax was rather anti climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although i saw it coming a mile away there was not as much suspense as i was hoping for and the thrill was mostly missing what else can i say watch it and make your own decision but overall i was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews,negative

it s my first semester teaching a general student jazz history course and i wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved i bought this video as a best of all options choice and was bowled over by it s thoroughness and attention to detail everything we d discussed about armstrong during class was there on the tape reinforcing my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear and see the legendary louis for pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile but for instructional purposes i d consider it a necessity for any future jazz classes i d teach i paid 16 bucks for it but having seen it i think i d ve paid fifty \( shh don t tell amazon,positive

git r done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head but end up doubling you over with laughter his preformance will definitely torque your brain so be prepared there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don t fart they don t even have buttholes he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever unless you are an idiot you know you can t look like him without a strict training regiment nice try larry he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti hillary clinton piece this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary i think larry the cable guy,negative
i got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it i bought season two and was pretty dissappointed the show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one i loved the ideas for episodes but didn t care much for how they played out bill got soft cuddles and dan got mean buttons and rocko stayed about the same but it wasn t enough great show but stick with season one,negative

eddie murphy is a comical guy but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this of course who is the right guy for it one of the questions i can t stand to think about in this movie is how dolittle hears the animals speak but their lips move and nobody notices can t they connect the dots obviously not and obviously the filmmakers couldn t either,negative
long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual song and dance i have come to believe that the old ways were in many cases the superior mode of transmission mere words could never convey the multi faceted beauty wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance this point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of holo mai pele holo mai pele is an exciting and exotic multi media production that i found absoultely engrossing the director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio the on stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting hawaiian landscape the on stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions lava flows and lush tropical rainforests all of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano goddess pele and her battle with her youngest sister hi iaka the narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance this dvd serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the hawaiian spirit of aloha truly a sacred visual document to be treasured,positive
this is my favorite toning workout and i m sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone fest what i like best about it is that i can customize it to whatever body part i think needs the most work this week need a 30 minute ab workout you can choose it think the arms and legs need work no problem want to tone a little bit of everything you can do that too the instructors are all good clear not irritating and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part it s not your standard crunches for ab work on this video this was one of my best purchases workout wise i wish there were more dvd s workouts out there with minna lessig she is my favorite instructor \( she does the arm leg workouts on this dvd \) the other two instructors are wonderful as well and the workout just seems to fly by although at the end you do know you ve worked those muscle groups,positive

we are halfway through the friends series 5 down 5 to go the 5th season of friends is the season where monica and chandler start their relationship ross gets married again to rachel out of being very very drunk they pass the 100th episode whenever i watch season five all i can really say is that it is easily watchable and is quite good but it isnt my favourite season for some reason i notice the episodes are kind of all over the place and its not like it used to be dont get me wrong i still love the show and this season is good but this one isn t vital i personally only bought this season for that episode where monica has a turkey on her head with the big glasses and hat and then dances i know stupid lol but its classic this season box set isnt desperately needed in your collection unless you want to see monica and chandler start their relationship and hide it with joey covering for them constantly \( the one with ross s sandwich is great when joey covers for monica and chandler \) the top 5 episodes are very easy to pick for this particular season my personal top 5 episodes are the one with all the kissing the one hundredth \( has to be here the 100th \) the one with the thanksgiving flashbacks the one where everybody finds out \( best here \) the one where rachel smokes i didnt care much for the season finale i mean identical hand twin not very funny very time wasting the only really good thing in the final is the very last scene overall not a stellar season not as good as season 3 or 4 but definitley up there somewhere not desperatley needed in your collection if only collecting a few contains some very good episodes the one where everybody finds out is a highlight check that out,positive

this movie was much better than vanilla sky vanilla sky mostly copied open your eyes but was too obvious and less convincing \( and tom cruise though good in some roles didn t fit this role well \) open your eyes takes a little longer to draw you in but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where vanilla sky does also the jungian dream aspect in vanilla sky is poorly done whereas open your eyes represents the dream experience very well i recommend watching both movies before you buy one but if you re going to buy get open your eyes,positive
the casting for this production could scarcely be better \( of particular note is the harrowing performance of judi dench \) and it s one of shakespeare s best plays that said this film of a production on stage doesn t quite carry the viewer s interest for the entire play there are times when the actors seem downright pretentious you feel as if they re tellings us we know how deep this is so appreciate it please that s too bad since macbeth is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film sadly this relatively slow moving production isn t it there are of course wonderful moments with mackellan and particularly dench \( no one plays the scene where lady macbeth goes crazy better than dame judi \) i just don t know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase for my money kurosawa s throne of blood is a far better choice,negative
this dvd was a total disappointment first of all this video was a rip off of baby genius series but without the production value second this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits to be fair there are fruits and vegetables but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals \( grilled turkeys etc \) and rotten milk \( in other term cheese \) chicken period \( eggs \) ice cream \( i think it s a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream \) and other non fruit and non vegetable foods this video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that s bigger than baby s head i believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition i would not recommend this video for vegetarians vegans or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits,negative

maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov s work and therefore have no preconceived notions but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre revolution russia the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy sentimental or even tragic,positive

flying down to rio is the film that marks the first pairing of ginger rogers and fred astaire the two are not the main attraction though the film stars dolores del rio and gene raymond in a tempestuous love affair raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women del rio is engaged to a man in rio de janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the american in a back and forth romance the two occupy plenty of the film the rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including i like music the carioca and orchids in the moonlight on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes the cast is good and the story is pretty standard but it is the music that spices up the film definitly take a look at this movie which is filled with inuendo only pre code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured,positive
i found i did enjoy this movie even though the director took liberties it doesn t follow so much the novel by jane austen but if you haven t read the book and are unable to do the comparisons this movie is enjoyable i gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director but did like what i saw,positive
st elmo s fire is one of those movies that could have been better should have been better and yet it just wasn t it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s the so called brat pack \( well everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall who were spared this misstep \) maybe this was supposed to be the breakfast club after college but while the breakfast club had characters even stereotypical characters that you could relate to there is absolutely no one with the exception of emilio estevez character that you care enough about to relate to in this film the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois but georgetown where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college uh huh yeah right judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage problem is nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy \( or maybe it s just the pearls \) emilio estevez is a future attorney working as a waiter server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell mare winningham is a dowdy trust fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her she instead fantasizes about rob lowe who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band who has dropped out of school married a white trash y looking groupie had a child with her and has now separated from her and taking up with other groupies demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking has a serious coke problem stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol sounds promising huh well in what is an early portend of the melrose place to come sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is dumps his ass immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job estevez after screwing up a lucrative house sitting job by hosting a party there travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home lowe in between faux playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere takes winningham s virginity and heads back to his estranged missus moore after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother has all her furnishings repossessed loses her job and freaks out not exactly the breakfast club the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves with the exception of estevez character they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped their every action every line of dialogue seems like just that they seem very one dimensional their so called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that winningham s character could have been salvagable except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was and yet she still gave her virginity to him maybe if winningham wasn t so bright or she was a college freshman it would be understandable but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent lowe really had little to do with his role maybe if he had played the role nelson had as the roving lothario with sheedy waiting at home it might have gone over better with his too pretty looks it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him nelson just doesn t seem comfortable and doesn t pull it off but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player moore basically plays herself an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems mirroring her character but was later rehired while the title song later become a minor hit st elmo s fire itself missed the mark,negative

i am a jane austen fan i love pride and prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel however mansfield park is jane austen s most complex and serious novel and on the whole it is my favorite fanny price is the most difficult of the jane austen heroines not the wittiest or most beautiful but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong she is mentored by her uncle the righteous and honorable and i don t use the terms loosely sir thomas bertram somehow the adaptation of this great novel has twisted sir thomas into a sadistic sexual pervert moreover fanny is constantly babbling to us in jane austen quips that are not part of this novel they simply missed the point of the book the acting is okay the settings are okay the directing is sad but the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste,negative

my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles i moved to echo park in late 2004 it s depressing the vicious cycle of drugs dropping out and domestic violence and it s all here told through the eyes of latina teenagers it was easy to see the woman s hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played i didn t care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven i also found myself not caring about any of the characters so and so gets shot la la loo goes to jail whatever as an aside though the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto it turns out my next door neighbor in real life is also called ernesto luckily it s just a coincidence,negative
at 23 years of age i can truly say that i have been a lifetime fan of sesame street watching the 3 dvd set of sesame street old school vol 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening because i was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired i expected most of the content to be new to me \( i was barely a year old when mr hooper s death was explained to the world \) but that was not the case many of the short films and interstitials were familiar \( and not just because i used to watch sesame unpaved on noggin \) to me as a viewer from the mid 1980s and i think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning sesame street truly revolutionized children s programming not just because it was educational but because it was \( and remains \) entertaining not pandering i ll admit seeing gordon with an afro orange oscar and the first few tries at big bird s head still freak me out a bit \( as they did when i saw them on noggin several years back \) but the show itself is just as good as i ever remembered something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment \( like transformers or he man or jem \) the set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons and 54 \( the liner notes are incorrect they should have asked count for help \) bonus clips the set also includes the 25 minute pitch film that was made before the series originally aired explaining sesame street s message and motive although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today s pre school children i believe they would probably enjoy classic street even more than the current lineup of shows the fact that today s pre schoolers may be more advanced than the sesame street of yore can really be attributed to sesame street itself and that s pretty cool still i personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults because so many of us associate our childhood with sesame street a booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and i found it informative according to muppet central a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues \( one with stevie wonder one with rogers hammerstein \) but because i never saw the originals i found nothing amiss what astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced no wonder they can t release full seasons although the full length episodes are great my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season seeing kermit sing bein green in its original form the bread milk and butter cartoon and the in in the sky with diamonds parody is a real treat the picture quality is great especially considering the program s age \( and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video although film was used for most of the interstitials \) i doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now the sound quality is good too mono of course but clear and crisp overall i highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved sesame street for those who were born after these episodes aired \( like me \) looking back at the beginning is really special it is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level,positive

this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch even if it doesn t feel as audacious as i m sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby it is the epitome of all opposites attract love stories as a twenty year old depressive connects with a 79 year old life loving woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death as they keep showing up at the same funerals however the root of their respective interests couldn t be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive while the hearse driving harold simply likes the morbidity of it all the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship while his mother constantly attempts to make the death obsessed harold more socially acceptable first she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates to foil any hope of romance with these women however he stages mock suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee to try to convince harold to join the army the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins \( years before becoming a director in his own right with foul play and nine to five \) allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters actions the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self an archetype she played for years afterward while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide eyed cynicism it s really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold s eye rolling mother ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest cat stevens soundtrack hasn t aged as well as say simon and garfunkel s music in the graduate but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings unfortunately the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included,positive
the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people i d say that about half of them get shot in this movie usually when a movie runs over 2 hours it s because there s a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in in the case of hard boiled the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo s desire to get into the guinness book of records for most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture chow yun fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff he shoots \( usually with a pistol in each hand \) while diving headlong over furniture while swinging from a rope while sliding down a banister \( \) while being hurled through the air by explosions sometimes he even shoots while standing still and he shoots and shoots and shoots and the bad guys shoot and shoot and shoot and yun fat s fellow cops shoot and shoot and you get the idea there are some fine action scenes in this film but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended there wasn t enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine gunned from the next and it became painfully repetitious personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled there s plenty of yun fat s balletic shoot em up action but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire,negative

alfred hitchcock s second film after being brought to america by david o selznick was suspicion which he made while on loan to rko pictures as in his first hollywood flick rebecca he put joan fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star fontaine won the best actress academy award for her portrayal of lina mclaidlaw a bookish and innocent \( but wealthy \) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish johnnie aysgarth \( cary grant \) after their quick courtship and marriage against her father s wishes lina begins to see johnnie for who he really is a penniless leech but she naively continues to love him nonetheless johnnie s charm is ostensible yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable lina s trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture the movie s only flaw is its tacked on and seemingly contrived final scene which we are told was due either to mr grant s popularity during these years or to the existence of the production code in effect in hollywood at that time hitchcock wanted a darker ending but as we see here he lost that battle however he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe the ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities suspicion is classic hitchcock grant and fontaine turn in masterful performances and nigel bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable beaky johnnie s old chum the flawed ending prevents placing suspicion at the top of any list of hitchcock s achievements but it is a fine film nevertheless and i can only give it my highest recommendation jeremy w forstad,positive

a review by the students in ent 201 insects on film \( clemson university clemson sc \) spring 2005 when better to meet your new man than while saving the world from giant radioactive grasshoppers that s what happened to audrey ames in beginning of the end the black and white movie produced in 1957 takes place in a small illinois town called ludlow near the big city of chicago the main character audrey is a persistent reporter who discovers a new and interesting story on her way to write about a lackluster flying demonstration on her way to the flying demo she is stopped at a roadblock in the town of ludlow illinois it seems that the town has been mysteriously destroyed overnight following a lead audrey goes to the u s department of agriculture and meets with the project director named dr ed wainwright in order to find out more about what happened dr wainwright tells audrey about a wheat factory that was demolished in the same area before the destruction of ludlow ed audrey and ed s co worker frank go to investigate the abandoned grain bins while they are there a locust comes from the woods and eats ed s co worker they finally realize what is destroying the towns and eating the people although it s a little too late for poor frank johnson determined to resolve the problem the military enlists the help of dr wainwright who tries to find a sound frequency that mimics the sound grasshoppers make before they attack the viewer of this film will be held in utter suspense until at a climatic moment dr wainwright discovers the right frequency and saves the city of chicago from the military s impending drop of an atom bomb the sound is broadcast from a boat in a lake outside of chicago and the sound attracts the grasshoppers to the lake as the grasshoppers follow the luring sound they eventually end up in the lake where they meet a watery death the city of chicago is safe and everyone lives happily ever after \( except sadly those who were eaten alive by the radioactive grasshoppers \) while this movie has extremely entertaining moments such as when the grasshoppers scale the skyscrapers of chicago looking for food the movie in general is a b attempt at science fiction also the movie was produced during the 1950s resulting in minimal attempts at realistic special effects the special effects are entertaining at best and add humor more than substance to the movie the viewer also might be left with several questions after watching this movie like why can t the national guard protect the citizens from grasshoppers or why is it more funny than tragic when dr wainwright s deaf mute assistance gets eaten alive by a grasshopper on a scientific or scholarly level the movie has several errors the most important error in the entomological sense is the noise that the grasshoppers make throughout the movie to make the noise that they did in the movie they would need wings in the movie though the characters say that the grasshoppers could not fly because they didn t have wings also the scientist indicates that the giant vegetables were produced through radioactivity which allows for photosynthesis to occur both day and night for photosynthesis to occur light must be present thus raising the question of how the vegetables could continue to expand during the darkness of night the inability of the grasshoppers to burn in the fires set by the military reflects an error as well in reality grasshoppers are highly flammable because of their wax like coating finally the plot as a whole is completely unrealistic and so bizarre that the movie should be placed in the comedy \( opposed to science fiction \) genre while clemson university research may have led to the evacuation of mole crickets from golf course greens using technological concepts similar to those presented in the movie the likelihood that radioactive grasshoppers would eat hundreds of people is improbable beginning of the end is an amusing movie to watch the acting is traditional of the sci fi movies of the era the special effects are mediocre but the humor in retrospect is delightful if you are a fan of cheesy sci fi suspense movies give this flick a try you will not be disappointed who knows maybe you ll learn something that could save the world the next time we are attacked by radioactive bugs,negative

this is a surprisingly poor movie although it has some well known actors and a notable director the material was just presented badly and predictably like a lousy late night tv movie with profanity inserted to liven it up the movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings \( though legitimate in many cases \) it also glosses over the grieving process of the family ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child overdoes kiefer sutherland s character flaws \( which are considerable nevertheless \) and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title in one particularly bad scene after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically sally s character simply stares open mouthed and dumbfounded at keifer s character when they meet on the street and he talks to her i don t know what i missed that the 4 and 5 star reviewers like so much i only see wide spread mediocrity i would only recommend this for fans of keifer ssssssorry sally not your best role or movie ditto ed harris whose other movies i generally like,negative

with the straight story lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love this film felt like a blind date gone bad the straight story showed up david lynch arrived but the rest of the date felt muddled confusing and utterly disastrous everything in this film seemed wrong lynch s choice for lead actor the bland sissy spacek the filler of repeat cornfield montages all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read i just felt that nobody had control over this picture yet the randomness \( and the possible tear ending \) gave critics something to smile about this is not a david lynch film and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive twin peaks or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois it just seemed repetitive and boring what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose alvin lying on the ground because he can t get up the clich use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame spacek s depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors then to add more fuel to the fire there was richard farnsworth again he isn t a horrible actor but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically but alas couldn t master it mentally farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen i couldn t tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime i saw it as babble \( and no i am not that insensitive i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger more professional actor \) the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant i wanted lynch to either go 100 for this film or none at all but alas it felt as if he just half ed his way through this heap speaking of david lynch where did he go in this film there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns looking at america class i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film instead of keeping us by alvin s side throughout his journey lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while but when the same images were used over and over again i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin but the stock footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way alvin was a walking storybook filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well lynch made alvin very closed minded which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature alvin was a strong character but i needed more with this story i wanted him to make choices learn new things and bring that to his brother s table when they eventually met i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin and not vice versa overall i wasn t stunned by this picture i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just played it safe the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin speaking of alvin why couldn t he have been a stronger better rounded character i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america but instead gave us nothing more than soft music recycled images and stock characters the stories were interesting to listen to but brought nothing fresh to the table i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye \( since i have a brother as well \) but why couldn t we focus on this further lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan when it was the central focus of this film the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch but instead it felt jagged and old i could suggest one viewing for this film any further and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be grade out of,negative
i bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and i was very disappointed first off it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music but the background exercisers really bug me too not only that the moves are strange she does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music i found my neck hurt a lot after that the leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself the ab section too was so old school i was hoping to find some new exercises i love karen voight but this dvd was definately the worst i have yet to purchase of hers all the other karen voight i own i absolutely love,negative

i must say i was dissapointed with those 2 stories first story is so far from reality \( i know i know sometimes we want to get away but not that far \) i couldn t read even half of the 2nd story it was written very poorly sometimes i felt like something just wasn t enough at times opposite like it was way too much anyway i wouldn t recomend bying this book,negative

angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5 star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman she focuses entirely on the black power movement in closing this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves,positive

i enjoyed this book having read other non fiction frontier books however i must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools objects etc i could have done without i would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker because such descriptions were so detailed if you re a technical hands on person then you probably would like knowing how items tools were built from raw materials in the frontier but for me i was more interested in the story than the instructionals,positive
this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing his book is mostly life stories and stupid ones at that some teeter the line of racism he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil fat black woman and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on race and besides that his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired and there is no self initiation for the type of voodoo he s talking about i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help his title is also misleading because voodoo ussually refers to hoodoo and vodun ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one he s just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life experiences are even worth tellin this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about,negative

set in venice at the end of world war ii hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old american colonel and renata a young and very pretty italian contessa loss is a recurring theme the death of many of the colonel s subordinates in combat the break up of his earlier marriage to a career woman and the severe injury to one of the colonel s hands from which he suffers constant pain the colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short what gives the novel so much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion renata and the colonel have for one another renata seeks to comfort the colonel and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness the colonel lovingly calls renata daughter hemingway tells this tale in the deceptively simple direct and matter of fact style for which he is justly celebrated i could have done without the duck hunting sequences and some of the colonel s more obvious macho behavior but hemingway being hemingway understandably could not this is a lovely and sad story filled with the yearnings of its two lead characters,positive

the miernik dossier was shockingly good before this i had never read anything by mccarry in fact i had never even heard the man s name i was lucky to come across a review of this re issued work in a magazine now i am collecting everything by him the story follows an odd assortment of people some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents as they travel south through europe into africa for the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if miernik is who he says he is the writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure in that sense the miernik dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel but yet it goes way beyond that it is also a highly compelling character study with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters this makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are the miernik dossier is a highly entertaining read true spy literature in the vein of ashenden that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories mysteries or simply great writing i cannot wait to read this book again,positive

as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled drawing people a technical guide for beginners and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery instead of a full out disappointment not that i blame the author solely most of the blame lies at my door i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure brune hogath s book aside \( another devastating disappointment \) and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art a school that i am still deciding on attending that instead of going my normal route \( ordering the book through the store checking it out in person and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount \) i impulsively bought the book only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews \( which all looked favorable \) now i realise my folly and am yet determining whether i ll pay for it \( i e keep the book \) i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience and i d say that experience shows equally in all areas not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through the problem is at least in my opinion that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing and it doesn t for the most part roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing the other three fourths talk about how to properly hold your drawing implement how to properly position yourself if you are drawing from a live modle maintaing a daily sketchbook researching your subject matter the relationships between the head neck and shoulders drawing hands drawing feet drawing eyes and a whole slew of other i wouldn t say irrelavent because they are relavent but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips again something bradley discusses on one single page the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing she didn t bother mentioning that how pants typically bunch up while you re walking seen from the head on profile three quaters and back view another topic she failed to mention some examples of evening formal attire vs day clothes how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up the effect of wearing multiple layers at once achieving that perfect windswept look and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide maybe i m being too harsh on bradley after all she does mention in her preface that there aren t a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure and compared to the standard how to books she s leaps and bounds ahead of the rest oh yeah that s another thing she doesn t outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom base the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere note the ripples or some junk like that back to me not being to harsh on bradley i guess in reading she is was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing for all who have read this drawn out rant two maybe three people and think i m all talk trust me if i had the skills i d come up with my own series of how to draw books and address all of my issues as is i m pretty good at drawing dynamic figures but the second i add clothing they become flat lifeless caricatures and i don t see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much as is my own artistic habits \( drawing from magazines online pics and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion \) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book you re better off doing what you ve always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics if you could write a review mentioning them somehow recommend them to me or whatever i d be eternally in your debt,negative
i m not a cosmologist but stephen hawking s universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending the language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper moreover the pictures are second rate pre contact lense hubble knock offs \( despite being published in 1997 \) and the book has very little to do with stephen hawking sure he wrote the foreward and did some editing but it lacks the wit and wonder of a hawking work naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading i am a chemist and despite this filkin s descriptions of chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb down ideas that aren t dumb downable and didn t include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts \( like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration \) if you want to learn some cosmology read a brief history of time or a short history of the universe these are simply written but informative works that won t leave you waiting for substance,negative

first of all i did not exactly read this biography instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work \( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way and still been able to read many more technology related books \) i had great expectations from this book having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson richard carwardine or doris goodwin i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character in this context i find mr mccullough s use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america i also enjoy direct quotes from letters speaches autobiographies as they help me refine my impressions of the context \( the period the relationships to contemporary characters \) surounding a promonent figure usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams time and i missed hearing the voice of john adams instead this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author finally having read other biographies of the founding fathers i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin all in all my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions had i known that i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough s fictional work,negative

this is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs jones a welsh methodist everton fc supporter london hack and oxford \( arts \) graduate goes to live in parma italy where his beloved has established herself he divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent english and his motifs will allow the first chapter discusses nuances of the italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that italy is a much more nuanced country than england and that its culture is infinitely more refined an entire chapter brings the nuances of italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down the football allows us to place italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it the last chapter is an entire ode to italy it is written largely in the second person and it tells of you going through the village and everything there appealing to the aesthetic in you the english is beautiful and it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm glow mission accomplished the chapter on italy s catholic religion and its protestant and other minorities could have done with much improvement italy s catholicism is more complicated than the padre pio cult and the protestants of the north surely have their faults as well the chapter looks like it came from several previous publications he wrote the politics chapters build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist factions are still at war with each other and that politicians like berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends he does a good job of tying the warring world war two factions in with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles he does not like berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide this fact my opinion of this book is that jones sat down with his material and tied it all together into a very passable but rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the money being charged,positive
i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it said parent would have no clue as it sure isn t mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading but this time this particular book slipped under my radar she told me that it had a reference to a gay character which i took to mean just a passing reference but when i read the book it was treated more seriously than i thought even going so far as to have the two girls kiss it is inexcusable both on ms pierce s part and on scholastic s no matter what the author s personal beliefs it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents i believe that as a parent i m the one responsible for what my children see and do but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision anise hollingshea,negative
first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others ike took advantage of her tina her self said she cared very much for him cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on so she released her autobiography in 1986 well after her come back in 1984 while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic excusse of a come back,negative
i know that as a wolf lover i am a bit biased but i would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect you see in this story three children are left alone a wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in because he wants to eat them unfortunately that s where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill this is just another stupid book that summed up says wolves are evil ugly beasts who attack people we have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children yep the wolf is depicted as evil in this book why couldn t they make it something that actually hurts people like a bear or a mountain lion ignorance that s why the wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book see near the end the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts they plan on luring him into their trap to get rid of him the wolf instantly falls for it which is lame wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on earth it s practically traditional to make children s books with wolves as villains and the chinese seem to loath wolves but this book crosses the line don t let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage stupid man eating beasts if they already think so you d be neglecting mankind s need to know things even more by letting them read it in other words it s a terrible book,negative
the burning was a big letdown after reading bentley little s masterful book dispatch i seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while bentley was ill and couldn t write who knows i love this guy and can t tell you how disappointed i was while one of the top 5 horror writers working today bentley little seems to be hit or miss with his stories i simply just did not enjoy reading this new release it seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick and with everything he was trying to do none of it not one moment was scary shadow creatures performing random oral sex creeping fungus talking voices in the microwave deformed goblins peering in windows skeletons climbing out of mud pits tunnels filled with moving corpses and a runaway ghost train crashing into the white house was just too silly it reminded me of his previous work the return another disappointment containing silly bizarre and unrealistic situations the scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value suspense and atmospheric quality the book had many problems that pulled me out of the story one of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day bentley needs to do what he does best which is to come up with a gimmick focus everything on that single idea and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling it worked with the store the association the policy and dispatch just to name a few let s hope he gets back on track with his next book,negative
i once read an article in horn book magazine \( a review source of titles and articles on children s literature \) that lamented the millions of poor translations of hans christian andersen polluting the minds of our young people today the review mentioned that stories like the snow queen which were originally written in a snappy vernacular have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their american translators with this idea fresh in my mind i found myself in possession of a very particular copy of the snow queen and i was able to test this theory myself now due to the wacky nature of amazon com the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this anderson story you will see that some of the reviews refer to nilesh mistry s some refer to the audio book some to eileen kernaghan s and some \( god help us all \) to mary engelbreit none of these however are the version that i am reviewing after careful consideration i selected the edition retold by amy ehrlich and illustrated by susan jeffers the ehrlich jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from thumbelina to cinderella with this 1982 classic edition they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of andersen s riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life most people don t remember that the snow queen begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad by a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day \( the details of this accident are left unclear \) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere if these splinters enter your eye everything will look ugly to you if they enter your heart it will turn instantly to ice got it good cause sure enough two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named kai when this happens he stops playing with his best playmate gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale snow queen gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures she escapes an overly loving old witch is taken in by a prince and princess falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin and at last saves kai from the snow queen herself by the end of the book neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it obviously the snow queen is one big ole story about growing up the idea of the devil s mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart well that s just another way of describing adolescence is it not andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale east of the sun west of the moon in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman heck tam lin was probably an influence as well the best version of this particular story i ever read was by kara dalkey it was a tale named the lady of the ice garden and can be found in firebirds an anthology of original science fiction and fantasy it is not however appropriate for children kids today will probably look at the snow queen and instantly think of the white witch from the lion the witch and the wardrobe i cannot think however that this is a bad thing as for the jeffers ehrlich version it s all right as an illustrator jeffers has apparently decided to make kai and gerta definitely children i guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the snow queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the snow queen s dress and every strand of her white white hair there is the odd stylistic choice here and there though when gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals i can t think that they re comfortable \( or even particularly practical \) the illustrations have been created according to the book using a fine line pen with ink and dyes they were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased as a result the book is as soft as a colored pencil but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink obviously i don t know enough about the original version of the snow queen \( or as andersen called it sneedronningen \) to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots at any rate it tells the full story warts and all and will provide them with what may well be the most freudian toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains a fun edition of a rather odd tale,positive

let s make this clear i won t put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself so this is going to be short and sweet this book is a glorified magazine worth 14 95 tops the pitfalls of bookbuying online i guess you never know what you are going to get anyways most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared the text portion however brief is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared the uninitiated might even be led to believe that kodak and konica are the only game in town in infrared films throughout the book the author treats these two as the coke and pepsi of infrared films i m going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same,negative
people say again and again that philosophy doesn t really progress that we arestill occupied with the same philosophical problems as were thegreeks but the people who say this don t understand why ishas to be so it is becauseour language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions as longas there continues to be a verb to be that looks as if it functions in the same way as to eat and to drink as long as we stillhavethe adjectives identical true false possible as long as we continueto talk of a river of time of an expanseof space etc etc people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up and what smore this satisfies a longing for the transcendent because insofar as peoplethinkthey can see the limits of human understanding theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language ambition is the death of thought these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago \( but most people have yet to find this out \) dennett though he has been a philosopher for some40 years is one them it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist john searle studied under famous wittgensteinians \( searle with john austin dennett with gilbert ryle \) but searle got the point and dennett did not dennett is a hard determinist \( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door \) and perhaps this is due to ryle whose famous book the concept of mind \( 1949 \) continues to be reprinted that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein ryle \( andmany others since \) have exposed in detail byaccident just before this book i had read the minds i which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981 they made some bad mistakes \( see my review \) and saddest of all they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess nagel s what is like to be a bat and an early version of john searle s chinese room argument explaining why computers don t think nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat s mind would be like searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does \( eg it can translate chinese without understanding it \) likewise we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad or just intelligible for many philosophical and scientific concepts our use of the words consciousness choice freedom intention particle thinking determines wave cause happened event \( and so on endlessly \) are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy \( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved \) chaos reigns wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this unfortunately he died inhis prime his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind \( language \) worksand he never wroteany popular books so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few searle is one of the world s leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett swork his review consciousness explained away of dennetts 1991 book consciousness explained and his book the mystery of consciousness are very well known and show in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing why neither dennett \( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic \) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem ie how do you conceptualizeconsciousness many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is \( mostly \) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious thinks etc he just points out that we don t have any idea how this happens searle characterizes as intellectualpathology the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how unsurprisingly there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book there arehowever many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is like most people it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 s and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with dennett says \( p98 \) that his view is compatibilism ie that free will \( whichi hopewe can equate with choice \) is compatible with determinism \( ie that there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future p25 \) he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity however the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice in the sense we normally understand it disappears and we are left with choice which is something we cannot choose naturally this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book consciousness explained it is remarkable that at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works \( or how an atom works for that matter \) that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote and what smore this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent because insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see the limits of human understanding theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these the relation between language thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost if one is very very careful some understanding is possible but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand there are at least 3 different topics here \( evolution of our brain choice and morality \) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms there is however no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms \( or his favorite example the game of life running on a computer \) are isomorphic with reality he knows that quantum indeterminacy \( or the uncertainty principle \) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined \( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom \) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with by extension its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain \( whatever that may be \) however the universe is a big place and its been around a long time \( perhaps forever \) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state the notion there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness \( or any other emergent phenomenon \) if so they will definitely win at least one nobel prize for not only will they have explained consciousness they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence \( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones \) so they would have to solve the easy problem \( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time ignoring uncertainty \) and the hard one \( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc \) and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable even for one atom or a vacuum as it would require an infinite amount of computer time but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls but physics is made of notions just as fantastic \( uncertainty entanglement wave particle duality schrodinger s dead alivecat etc \) and as feynmann said many times nobody understandsphysics many think nobody ever will on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our robotic teams are put togther over a lifetime of growth and experience this is a bald dismissal of human nature of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference but for whom nobody but philosophers we make choices what s the problem one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem what are consciousness pain yellow intention matter quarks gravity etc i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice this shows that there is something strange about such questions wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode decoupled modes permit thinking about the past planning for the future guessing the mental states of others etc but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think john will try to steal my wallet rather than just imagining that john might do it confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode enter the realm of pathology some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way they lose control of which mode they are in eg notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode normal mode eg what is that lion doing was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next evolved later this was probably never a problem for animals any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes hence we have philosophy and this book which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode let us alter wittgenstein s quote to read as longas there continues to be a verb to decide that looks as if it functions in the same way as to eat and to drink as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action of saying i wish i had done otherwise etc etc people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up as withmost philosophy books nearly every page often every paragraph changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story etc and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives like we count on food and water but who ever outside philosophy standing in front of lunch counter full of food ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones \( this is not a trivial observation \) the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children so i would say that normally nobody counts on having choice but rather we just choose on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice and that it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic but it is not and on page 13 it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning deciding promising resenting etc but that these are built in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood there is no evidence that they change as we grow or are in any way subject to our beliefs only that they mature just as our body does on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it do we believe we see an apple feel a pain are happy the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can t meaningfully then say that we still believe it \( except as a joke etc \) the inference engine can run in decoupled \( belief \) mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice but dennett is saying thisis the universal case if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else consciousness seeing thinking etc if we take this seriously \( and he says the serious problems of free will \) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life then madness is minutes away on page 65 et seq he discusses causation intention and the informal predicates that we use to describe atoms etc but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents \( ie animals or people or things like them ie ghosts or gods \) are involved we use our concepts \( engines \) for agency intuitive psychology social minds etc to decide how to behave there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines depending on the precise situation discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics agency ontological categories etc of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein s many incisive comments on causation intention deciding nor of searle s now classic works on intention and social reality he spends much time on ainslie s book breakdown of will in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties \( ie inference engines \) by which we evaluate probable outcomes hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism emotion and economics but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published it was bingham s idea amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson \( 1992 \) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising indeed they are and in fact they are standard parts of economic evolutionary and cognitive theory but unfortunately he makes little reference to the other work in these fields all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text again he gets things backwards as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines as he notes hundreds of experiments with the prisoner s dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people s choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious they are much slower and less reliable so there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought dennett says we make ourselves so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results if we or others do not we feel guilt outrage resentment etc then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved our genes make us so we can t \( mostly \) do otherwise not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50 000 and some millions of years ago in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making \( from certain angles \) he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some \( unspecified \) properties possessed by traditional free will the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice he insists \( top pg 226 \) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility but making ourselves so we couldn t do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function nor does it seem to leave any room for morality as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so normally if someone asks us to move our hand we know what counts as having a choice but typical of philosophers i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position at this point he also starts his discussion of libet s well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time on page 253 et seq he sneaks in his definition of conscious will the brains user illusion of itself which has as one of its main roles providing me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times and illusory or not conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action he says the trick we need is to see that i control what is happening inside the simplification barrier where decision making happens mental events become conscious by entering into memory the process of self description is what we are the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space \( the brain \) and time \( memories \) he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous \( everyone who can follow this and really understands \) i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness and the real self out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced many will say he took the words out of their mouth but i would say it s incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe \( making the obvious extensions of such claims \) was gone long beforewegot this far on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals this is a stunning denial of human nature \( ie genetics and evolution \) coming from the person who wrote darwin s dangerous idea presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space \( the brain and other people \) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness \( line 6 from bottom \) he says consciousness is a user interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain \( you will have to suffer through consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either \) though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades \( social mind intuitive psychology coalitional intuitions etc \) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture thats ok but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes we are also told here that r d \( by which he means evolution here but other things elsewhere \) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality i am sure that he will get little agreement on this it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates \( and earlier \) long before spoken language \( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain \) he continues morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes which is an amazing \( and totally incorrect \) thing to say even if he was only referring to memes on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our bland dispositions to cooperate they mean nothing to us but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being \( eg autism \) i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions like all the templates are accessible to consciousness we may decide our cheating was justifiable or forgive someone else s cheating but we still know it was cheating \( ie we cannot change the engine \) i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings another issue is that as culture developed one had to make many important or moral type decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer on pg 267 he says that we now replace our free floating rationales \( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines \) with reflection and mutual persuasion and on pg 286 he says that it is a child s upbringing demanding and giving reasons that affects moral reasoning again he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self which takes responsibility it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education \( memory \) and sharing it s clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ought and is unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago ie they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes \( eg see the blank slate \) he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like praiseworthy were shaped over millennia by culture while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess \( evolutionarily stable strategy \) can produce morality his idea here is that genetic r d produces dim understandings of morals and then culture \( memetics \) produces variations and clarifications i would say that we all know and much research has made clear that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore which i started reading 30 years ago since it s authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us but there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho s 200 books than anywhere in philosophy one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities there is no sign here nor in anything he has done that dennett is morally superior after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them it seems clear that like all of us he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines so how much opportunity is there to improve our morality it seems clear \( eg see pinker s the blank slate \) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties on average maybe 5 of the variation in moral behavior \( variations are the only thing we can study \) is due to our own efforts the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is and if one did we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first to return to the quote at the beginning ambition is the death of thought indeed though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts,negative
i bought this book before my first trip to austria i had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations that turned out to be true what shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that austrian women are strong minded and independent and organize their homelife well although many go to work this book might have some value for a person who had never left their english speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach it also provides some amusing anecdotes about language \( especially viennese \) and useful info about festivals mostly though this book was good for reading aloud to austrian friends i would quote it as an iron clad authority when their behavior didn t quite match the book s version and thereby amused them tremendously lynn hoffman author of the new short course in wine and the forthcoming novel bang bang from kunati books isbn 978160164000,negative

i am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well i read this book about ten years ago and i read it regularly every couple of years the story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a run down community is a classic of american literature what this book and o connor s other novel the last hurrah apart is the writing in an era where writers seem to challenge one another to be more like faukner and less comprehensible to the average man o connor wrote very well and his language is beautiful from this fine prose arises really deep characters which are flawed and so easily identifiable to us all,positive
this was by far the best genero kenzie novel of the series i loved this book everything about it in this one you really got to see the emotional side of bubba made him more likeable the storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down i was happy to see angie and patrick back together the ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book i m scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why lehane hasn t published another it s been 5 years i will be watching for it,positive

i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they hadn t a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little,negative

ok this book is funny the first time you look through it overall i would not recomend this book because it s one of those books that you ll just look through one time and one time only yeah there are a lot of positions but they are all repeated in the book like five times with different names and another thing there are a lot of positions that are not even posible and some only with a giant swing or how about a horizantal or verticle pole yeah many people have those in their houses but seriously the only positions that you ll be able to do are the ones that you know already,negative
there s a ton of paper in this book overboard in my opinion wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious i ve taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information hasn t been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california,negative

well the fact that i m writing a review about this book while it s sitting open on my desk next to my computer open and not being read might be some evidence of how i m enjoying this book this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn t be so difficult this book is not clear or easy to understand at all every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page \( \) making this work look like a research project for a phd publication i have the casebook in this series and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity and it turns to be true this book might be good if you re advanted contracts and want to know every little detail or as an advanced reference later on to look something up like in an encyclopedia some concepts which should be pretty clear just get too in depth coverage in this book it s too complex for a first year student sometimes it starts describing the different views out there and then there s a jumble in your head as to what the law really is i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors,negative

the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states edmund burke could he see our century never would concede that a consumption society so near suicide is the end for which providence has prepared man but wait the conservative mind was first published in 1953 the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell meanwhile burke a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times there are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society kirk writes what men really are seeking or ought to seek is not the right to govern themselves but the right to be governed well but what he offers is a lack of true representation the author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender is it so surprising that kirk lauds some of the worst racists in american history like nathanial bedford forrest whom he describes as magnificent before quoting his racist vitriol in a particularly galling move he referrers to pro slavery advocate john c calhoun as a defender of minorities and praises john randolph for among other things opposing doctrines of racial equality kirk goes on about calhoun s support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the fugitive slave act which forced federal officials and law officials in northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of 1000 fine he supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery for calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern anti slavery agitation and supports calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty although calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty one wonders if kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the calhoun mounted a strong protest against domination by class or region another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state the duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line quoting samuel coleridge the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control sounding like the inspiration for disgraced chief justice roy moore russell kirk urges that state and church ought never to be separate entities true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit it rises far superior to earthly law being indeed the source of all law kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of god but never draws a distinction i have to wonder if like the modern reconstructionist kirk wanted to see the laws of leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers he never explains how one might recognize a law of god besides using prejudice the third thread would be kirk s anti intellectual \( or perhaps pro stupid \) stance he refers to human reason as puny and impotent and claims that we find the mind of god in prejudice and tradition prejudice he writes is of ready application in the emergency it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision skeptical puzzled and unresolved actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for god and those in higher stations and authority in order to grab the golden fleece of populism conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident like calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade i found russell kirk s salesmanship of conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day,negative

mark liberman and geoffrey k pullum could be accused of making the best of an already satisfactory situation in publishing this book that reiterates their ongoing blog on linguistics but for this reader having never visited their blog \( until now \) this book is a treasure trove of quips and oops and pooh bahs and evidences of the strangely twisted manner in which we communicate written in a casual style that makes the faux pas revelations more cogent the authors share embarrassingly poor writing from the media from authors from those in control of the country \( as though the mentality of the us might somehow be reflected in the malapropisms of george w yikes \) and yet reading this blogline of information never seems vitriolic criticism is one of the most substantial ways to create change and hopefully this book and blogline will focus many minds on the misuse of the english language perhaps effecting some much needed corrections far from the madding gerund \( didn t you always wonder why thomas hardy used that word in the title of his great novel far from the madding crowd \) is a book to pleasure the mind and humor and a fine resource for perusing before writing or speaking to a group of wise souls so maybe it is a print form of a blogline but for those of us who tire of wading through the computer for reading it is a complete \( compleat \) pleasure grady harp june 0,positive

as a beef eating hindu i am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat i browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing first it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes it clearly had a bias which turned me off second i am generally up to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book there were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers \( the government of india demands be ritually burned \) later i searched on google with the book title and words ban government of india and found no news reports relating any government of india attempts at banning this book there were no reports on ban by allahabad high court either all i found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions third i found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions it basically left me disappointed and i am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter,negative
there is little more i can contribute to this literary masterpiece even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work gustave flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected madame bovary with care he worked on the novel for nearly six years during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times often spending days perfecting a single paragraph the result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty madame bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine emma bovary as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth she exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle class humdrum lifestyle flaubert s realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal in perfect contrast to emma flaubert introduces charles bovary a proto typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer soon after their wedding emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling charles and yearns for a romantic interlude flaubert represents the absolute clich of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding unimpressive and unnoticed middle class man flaubert brings all facets of human personas full circle with the shy well mannered and well liked young man next door leon with a slow blossoming relationship with emma leon leaves for paris to study law upon his return and with a little experience the two become lovers flaubert s portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore thereafter the degeneracy of emma s lifestyle is evident and she is brought to the brink of destruction in madame bovary gustave flaubert gives us a vivid and life like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small town people living in france during the mid nineteenth century flaubert s descriptions are detailed and beautiful and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing opening with first person narration that sometimes shifts to third person has earned gustave flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century,positive

turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose months after i gave up on it i have a door that rattles if it s not wedged open and t o c is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own i struggled oh how i struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters i stirred the pages wildly while i waited for the plot to thicken i fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier i searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if i had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don t need a subject a verb and an object or even a permutation of two out of three i left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it i offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car i considered lighting the fire with it i wondered whether if i took just a few pages a day i could eat it and get rid of the evidence i offered it to my mother in law for christmas i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt and then eventually voila the rattling door what a fine tome t o c is another few hundred pages and i could have used it as a sea anchor for the titanic,negative
flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn s political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn s politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i m still looking,negative
gunstories by beth atkin is a book that should be mandatory reading for all students and discussed with parents teachers and friends young people discuss guns in a positive light and a negative light as with any subject it is only with education and knowledge that a change can be made i definitely recommend this book and hope that it can be a fixture in all elementary middle and high schools \( p s if you are a school librarian order a copy \) shelley \( henderson nv \) a fascinating look at a difficult topic many viewpoints are presented the book is fair and balanced but the stories of gun violence just naturally have more impact than those of kids who enjoy range shooting the dichotomy between rural and urban viewpoints is striking the wonderful photography really adds to the text recommended diane \( cedar rapids ia \) despite the fact that i m not really in support of guns it is nice to read a book on such a controversial topic that does not carry a political agenda it s not your typical pro con book either it gives actual perspectives from real life people teen people who just want to tell it like it is amy \( fort worth tx,positive

it s always easy to criticize somebody s personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable actresses and not stars of the studio era so it comes pretty natural to ask is esther williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook margaret sullavan was grace kelly s talent so overwhelming to forget that miriam hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as lubitsch wyler mamoulian hawks and vidor to stunning results what was wrong with mary astor s acting and what is right with kim novak s actress to me means patricia neal or shelley winters norma shearer or natalie wood were stars think about it,negative

this book is probably the worst written i ve ever encountered it was so flawed as to be considered literature alice walker tries to one up harriet beecher stowe in writing about brutality titles like these are weapons used in the anti black male agenda this society has long perpetuated all the men depicted in this book are one dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting the women are portrayed as martyred forlorn pseudo saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women i ve learned long ago when absolutes such as these are presented a greater agenda is at work there are no real men in this book only distorted caricatures of black masculinity i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst i find this title as dangerous as hitler s mien kampf in it s portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible true there are criminally abusive men in every culture but there are also forthright upstanding men as well to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about harriet beecher stowe s fictional uncle tom s cabin sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men this book is fiction however it is not presented as such i m sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations however i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book in my opinion this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers viewers of the people within it i don t find it a testament to the strength of black women at all i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes the further distortion of african american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman i m sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book feminist racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women most definitely not i doubt it would have even found a publisher america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african american culture my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion whatever ms walker s motivations were in writing this novel i m sure mercenary incentives were not discounted this is racist misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature,negative
this was a required text for one of my graduate courses and i didn t expect to enjoy it much it wasn t far into the book that i began to resonate with some of the struggles for racial harmony articulated by perkins and rice in chapter 1 spencer perkins states emphatically the civil rights movement has run its course and we ve gotten just about all you can expect to get from a political movement i a white guy took offense at the thought that someone would declare the struggle for civil rights obsolete his point is well made through the development of this and subsequent chapters the move toward reconciliation must move from race to grace regardless of your religious affiliations if you are engaged in civil rights causes or racial reconciliation you would be remiss to neglect this ground breaking tome pax erik,positive
i have got to say that this is definitely the best cheesecake book ever initially i was shopping around for one since my boyfriend s favorite dessert was cheesecake i ran across this and decided to get it well one of the best choices i could ever make i think this is an amazing book starting from the recipes which are so numerous and so varied that they have to be divided into beverage based chocolate vanilla candy etc even one for light cheesecakes honestly deciding which one to try the first time around was the toughest challenge when starting out well i followed the instructions clearly as well as the first section on tips to avoid it cracking and boy did it ever come out wonderfully i never looked back i ve baked from it endlessly for some years now tasting practically all of the recipes included it s gotten to the point where i may soemtimes tweak the recipe and or ingredients a bit and it still comes out great my family has enjoyed all sorts of different flavors and many of my family members and friends have converted and use nothing but this to bake cheesecakes also my copy is so beat up from use it may be time to get a new one did i mention that this is also a beautiful book full of wonderful \( yummy looking \) glossy pictures my only \( tiny \) complaint is that on occasion some of the ingredients may be a little hard to get but nothing too major and definitely nothing s that stopped me yet i do have other cheesecake books which people have given me over the years but due to simplicity astounding variety and plain old wonderful results this is the one i recommend the most,positive
dave barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from the miami herald there is a huge margin in difference of quality in boogers are my beat than in his initial non fiction books such as dave barry s bad habits boogers are my beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you don t want to put down until the back cover dave barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you can t use the towels hanging in the bathroom the salt lake city olympics babies on airlines north dakota bear in the big blue house and cell phones to name just a few his article written the day after september 11 and one written a year after about the philadelphia crashed plane are also included which prove barry could have been a serious writer if he had pursued that career thankfully he didn t because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is his carl hiaasen style fiction novel tricky business big trouble isn t bad either check them out along with his other non fiction novels as well,positive
i first encountered this gem of a book when i decided to home educate my children for a few years and it came with my daughter s fourth grade calvert school kit yes it is european ethnocentric and there are the references to god but our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain context even to children whether you are a bible thumper or dedicated atheist or somewhere in between don t discount this book just because of your beliefs there is much that is amazing and simply golden in this book as a historian i cannot think of a better way to introduce western civilization to a child the storybook format is a real winner with kids and if you re reading it to them aloud as i did well play editor as you go along or take the time to explain the context of the times in which it was written i will be ordering another copy of this book as my original copy was stolen by some rather sneaky and acquisitive ex inlaws \( you know who you are \) this book is a don t miss and it is also excellent for adults who don t like history but recognize the need for such knowledge,positive

if you are a christian this book isn t for you it is full of blashphemy concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution since when was god in need of forgiveness isnt it that god so loved the world and it wasnt us that loved god i have no words in describing this book it is full of error because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person why do bad things happen to good people wrong question there are no good people in the world in the first place for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god the world is in sin the world does not have good people only by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book it hasnt helped 4 million people but it lied to them kusher please turn from your ways and come to jesus then will you understand the life question why,negative

with every grisham book i read i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense but to insert other elements to make this human as well for once we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain however this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune however she does not know this a lawyer is sent to find her and in the process undergoes a fundamental change of his own this story takes place in washington maryland west virginia and the rain forests along the brazilian bolivian border in typical grisham fashion he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight you can envision the rainforest and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o riley this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue the pages literally turn themselves do not start this novel before going to bed or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down,positive

i was eager to read this book but after reading it i was left completely flat the rest of the iceberg hardly smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading sports illustrated or any minnesota sports page he admits he s not a fan of football but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career this book is touted as his full and complete story so we learned he was watching ren stimpy during his nfl draft wow are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read how about telling us more of the inside details how did smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player who were his friends that he could trust and when did he need that trust what thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent what was he doing when he was goofing off and missing class all summer which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at ohio state when and why did he begin using pot if football is not smart enough for him why doesn t he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging what happened to plans for medical school we know the stories of football those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented i also felt smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of america who is attacking him why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much highly paid athlete stories are sorry for the pun a dime a dozen he tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy the truth is many people will take a job for 5 less than a co worker because yes they value things other than money and yes they are happy to have a job leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers it felt like i was reading an average high school creative writing project i did this i did that i went to bed next day half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy pop music smith notes less than 50 percent of americans read at a 10th grade level well this book certainly won t tax the reading ability of too many people one lesson from this book is that smith had opportunities to swallow his pride take some coaching and come up with a better solution this book is another one of those times he should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance build the characters help us feel their stories instead smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions sorry but compared to other autobiographies this was not an emotional book i m sure smith is all the things that mike gutter says he is such as thoughtful honest trustworthy dependable passionate but i felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book instead we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg,negative

this is a simple book to read through for younger children written by native americans it is a thanksgiving book from their point of view why native americans have always celebrated thanksgiving it has no mention of pilgrams or not fully proven overly romanticized stories as most thanksgivings are but simply a beautiful description of the season the great harvest and respect for the world around them a book of why the native americans gave thanks during this beautiful season,positive

not to be disrespectful but are you people for real i can t believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars there was nothing good about this book a bunch of people in the book did not even matter bill kendall s wife the new anchor man pete whatever his last name was the boss yelena eliza s boyfriend the priest even the soon to be president and his wife i mean what s the point in even mentioning them they were not involved in the main events she didn t even talk about what happened to them at the end the judge is the only one that matters and she didn t even write about him all that much really disappointing as i said i don t mean to be disrespectful but to give this book 5stars you must have read either bedtime stories all your life or not have read anything don t waste your money that s all i have to say sorr,negative
some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge an aquaduct or the entrance to a castle it probably wasn t too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room my guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room but as soon as one was built i suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created and that an artist could transform this sky into a vision of heaven this book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth it is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth,positive
unlike most dystopian novels which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future a clockwork orange focuses on the nature of the individual in the future our protagonist is alex only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal roving the streets with his band of friends taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him the boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless in fact the more helpless the victim it seems the more pleasure the boys take in the act the most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes they aren t doing any of this out of malice toward their targets in fact it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim they are creating mayhem just because it s fun for them everything changes however when one particular break in goes horribly awry and alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder there though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality then after two years he is chosen for a new experimental rehabilitation program designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in or even contemplate any acts of violence as we see however this treatment also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not he has to be good because he is programmed to be this of course raises the question central to the book does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice the book can be a little difficult to get in to at first predominantly because of burgess s unique style the story is narrated by alex and thus is written in the complex slang language invented by burgess for this book that the youth of this society engage in for example a sentence taken from the opening chapter he looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that \( pg 5 \) there is no glossary but if you stick with it you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters however if you find yourself having difficulty a nice comprehensive lexicon can be found on wikipedia if you search for english to nadsat \( due to review guidelines i am not allowed to include a direct link \) unfortunately it is alphabetized by the english equivalents not by the slang terms so looking up a word can be a little difficult one final note of interest the original british publication of a clockwork orange had 21 chapters as does the current american edition however when the book was first published in the united states the last chapter was dropped as burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout whether it is or isn t is up to you to decide but i can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book without the final part of the story in place the book offers a bleak message implying that human nature cannot really change on the other hand reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope beyond that burgess tells us in his introduction interpretation is up to you,positive
i have never been a fan of danielle steel s books and have only read a couple in my lifetime and those many years ago i m not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors extreme boredom insanity but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer s work actually i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was the writing was completely repetitive and superficial and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself it read like a poor book report and then he did this and then he did this and after that he did this and then he laughed we are told that the bachelors who struck me as commitment phobic a little neurotic and fairly immature despite their \( middle \) age but not necessarily toxic are decent likable guys but we never really see too much proof of that when the proof does come it s so ham handed as to be laughable charlie s eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character yeahsurerightwhatever most of the story is told through narration with little bits and pieces of ho hum dialogue the author adopted a third person point of view but there s certainly nothing omniscient about it and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable this is how men behave and relate to one another i find that hard to believe considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other i liked the female characters of the book initially they all seemed to be strong capable independent and emotionally healthy women but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous mountains out of molehills for instance gray the 50 year old artist who has always been phobic about family refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he s been with for several months and whom he claims to love nevermind the fact that he s known about the adult children since the very beginning nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy while gray and sylvia are new yorkers nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent self sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face to face visits evidently gray can t see beyond the fact that they are kids and therefore family and therefore not to be tolerated sorry but whatever sympathy i d developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity dump the weenie sylvia you can do better the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness and of course everything was wrapped up magically with sudden capitulation as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters their conflicts and resolution i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book and why i bothered reading i,negative
i am so passionate about this book it has answered all the life questions i have ever held although many people i have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to get into it for me i would say it is the best book i have ever read this is about the 5th copy i have purchased because when i lend it out somehow it is not returned and i want to have a copy to re read every now and then \( i will not be lending this one again,positive
over 20 years after it was published the story of the israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the plo \( bubba s jacques un s buddy yasser \) in lebanon is no less important interestingly lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of syrian occupation they have gone from the vegan dictator hafez assad murdering opponents and journalists to the syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists \( another killed last week 7 2005 \) in this review i will attempt to explain the story the left wing doves reporter s views \( and on so many levels his mistakes \) and most importantly to americans who love and support israel the correlation between israel s actions and our war on terror first to the journalists the main one being the left wing newspaper haraatz ze ev schiff as the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby mr schiff is a member of the israeli left dove peace now group this coalition consists of myopic people \( with all due respect \) that don t seem to understand good and evil just as our great president bush was criticized for denouncing the axis of evil \( he forgot to mention syria and the house of saud \) these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our their enemies this is what lead to the fraudulent oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting palestinian authority it is this authority that unleashed a wave of terror on israel immediately after clinton helped the murderer arafat receive a nobel peace prize fittingly arafat walked away from the clinton barak plan in 2000 which would have created a palestinian state which to this day \( 7 8 05 \) does not exist despite the charade of the road map the authors accuse prime minister sharon of illegally leading israel into the war in lebanon most of the books i ve read about israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit sharon he seems to be the donald rumsfeld of israel i don t live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation but he was democratically elected so most of the voters must disagree with the left s assessment of mr sharon \( yes i know his disengagement is an illegal abomination more on that later wear orange to support the settlers \) on page 39 mr ze ev describes sharon as a cynical headstrong executor who regarded the idf as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements and not necessarily defensive ones and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power those would prove to be the kindest words he would have for mr sharon on page 58 he accuses sharon of implementing a quasi coup d etat and on and on it goes the author also accuses sharon of duping the american government details forthcoming later on we learn of the courageous freedom fighter \( my emphasis \) arafat s decision to deploy all palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill israelis of course to this day the pa affiliated fatah and other groups use children to murder israeli civilians \( the best non child attack recently was the palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in israel who tried to kill innocent israeli doctors nurses using bomber pants great video of her discovering the bomb wouldn t activate however us msm mainstream media other than fox refused to air it \) on page 92 we learn of arafat crony and current pa leader abu mazen s \( the same oslo and road map violating terrorist supporting enabling holocaust denying chain smoking mazen that gw brazenly brought to the white house \) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of jews for murder throughout the story if indeed the cabinet was mislead we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences specifically a failure to call up the reserves to his credit and unlike journalists robert fisk \( pity the nation \) and thomas friedman \( ny times from lebanon to jerusalem \) mr schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by ray ban wayfarer wearing arafat even inside his own plo on page 147 we learn of palestinians killing palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to idf action in this episode three children were gunned down in front of their father on page 149 the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of idf members in discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation the author s ask was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries and further how would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem are you kidding me these members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace meanwhile the un the left doves the media and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to arafat s involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the plo prior to the lebanon operation in my humble view something had to be done prime minister begin agreed with sharon s initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in beirut page 152 features more america bashing culminating in an accusation that the us was an israeli dupe the story of the military operation is detailed completely and no discussion of the lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in sabrit and shatilla i ll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation but in short israel relied on their allies in lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists most assuredly after the palestinians brought havoc to these people they wanted revenge the result some civilian deaths to go along with the clean up operation and a rebuke of several israeli figures including prime minister sharon folks war is not pretty and the us faced similar choices in partnering with the northern alliance in afghanistan many to this day say that is why we allegedly lost bin laden in tora bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the pakistan border general tommy franks says this would not have been possible and i believe him more than the kerry kedwards crowd our ally pakistan would not have tolerated a us presence given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the taliban as for the author s attempts to rid israeli society of prime minister sharon it didn t work he forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the lebanon operation after yasser walked all over clinton in barak in 2000 and launched restarted the intifada israel voted for arik and his platform of not negotiating with arafat sadly no tragically he is haphazardly implementing his disengagement plan six weeks prior to its start it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that israelis are increasingly against it moreover turning land over to terrorist supporting mazen will embolden those that seek israel s destruction israel expects terror gangs of hamas islamic jihad and mazen s own fatah to immediately set up shop in the west bank and begin terror operations so looking back mr schiff and ya ari who was right terror coddling doves such as rabin \( who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting arafat \) and peres or likud hawks such as sharon \( and netanyahu \) let the reader decide i know who i would trust with my security likud members sharon and netanyahu,positive
the island of lost maps is the story of a petty crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the 90s posing as a researcher bland would enter rare book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single edged razor then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting or at least unquestioning dealers before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore he had stolen more than a half million dollars worth of maps island is the first book for author miles harvey in the book he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350 page book he is only partly successful i found the material on bland s crime fascinating however bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime there is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking but as a true crime book it over extends itself it would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused,negative

if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman s self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student,negative

while it s certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination deconstructionism by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is of course inhabited by people who read and people who write this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone,negative

i thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself however the truth is you need money to invest in real estate so there s really no way around it which made her book redundant she just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies in the end the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth i really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties,negative

on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms cornwell having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning i simply cannot help but ask myself is she really writing this stuff very slow in the beginning i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly however this novel does begin to pick up momentum but not until the reader is halfway through and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime richmond virginia where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl so scarpetta with marino tagging along of course heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance only to find that her old building is being demolished and that the new one under the leadership of dr joel marcus is sloppy regarding policies and procedures the demoralization of her former staff by dr marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta and clearly he resents her intrusion so why has he asked her to come meanwhile lucy as head of the last precinct is once again up to her ears in nonsense for such a brilliant successful young woman \( as readers have always been lead to believe \) why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee worse than the weak storyline and the fact that this novel is just all over the place is the author s disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african americans throughout drug dealers are black they re dead of gunshot wounds and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man s conspicuously large organ are you kidding me the trash collectors are big dark men and of course in an upscale neighborhood the old black woman must work in one of the houses the author s unbelievably narrow minded stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy read only if you must but frankly there are better ways to spend your time dy,negative

while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book it reminds me of the story the emperor has no clothes yes choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying the flipping back and forth was not accomplished in a smooth flowing manner in addition the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone,negative

two huge problems with this book one this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and traveling and learning when they already know his identity so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass two the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman s other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels this thing drags on in some unnamed nondescript city,negative
for over three years i ve been studying buddhism and zen during that time i ve ordered many books within the different buddhist schools there are many fine authors out there that explain the tenets and fine workings of buddhism as well as zen i believe a solid background in buddhism background is essential in understanding buddha s message to mankind however the true nuts and bolts of buddhism practice can be found most directly in zen it is one thing to know something about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to apply it ezra bayda has most succinctly given the best instruction of how to apply zen to one s life where we need it the most during those moments when we are gripped with our core pain core pain is comprised of our anger traumas sadness feelings of inferiority etc it is this core pain that can make our life a living hell ezra examines these emotions and teaches us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that truly works instead of denying them or trying to escape them we learn that they are part of our path in life and while it takes courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us away from the genuine life we all deserve at least one reader has referred to this as being like a self help book yet anytime we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology aren t we looking for something to help us ezra offers us the tools to achieve transformation in our life when i ordered this book i had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply zen teachings to my life what i didn t realize is that the information this book contains would exceed anything i have read in any religious book psychology book or college text another reviewer said where s the zen in reference to the contents of this book the zen is there on every page while ezra doesn t use the esoteric style of writing common in zen buddhist teaching his simple clearcut way of communication exemplifies the simpleness that zen is truly about ezra s other two books at home in the muddy water and saying yes to life are excellent as well and deepen your understanding of living mindfully and in the moment a helpful hint read his three books in chronological order with this book first personally i think that reading them in order adds to a person s understanding and that each book acts like a foundation for the next ezra bayda i have not had the honor of meeting you personally yet i thank you most sincerely for the gift of your writings i bow to you for you are a master there are many of us i m sure that are looking forward to your future works two other excellent zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with difficult emotions are beginning mindfulness learning the way of awareness by andrew weiss and at hell s gate a soldier s journey by claude anshin thomas also the writing s of thich nhat hanh a great man who highly influenced both of these authors teaches the art of mindful living in a very understandable manner good luck to you on the path,positive

the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand the reason i didn t like it was because it was challenging for me the english was hard to understand i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books this book was more like an opera with out music if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war if you re an older audience it would be a good book or if you re looking for a good love war story,negative
i would agree with the translator that imitation of christ ranks very close to the bible i read it over and over it is shocking clear and concise it forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim yes to be a saint thomas a kempis s words cut to the heart and ring true over and over in the normal state of human depravity deception duplicity relativism and excuse making no one could write such a book without a transcendant almighty omniscient omnipresent and infinitely merciful lord each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our lord more and more i wait patiently for your return lord jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth,positive
i picked this up because it s considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie then the book must be pretty good not so with howard s end the plot in howard s end doesn t progress much outside of an early death and later marraige you have to have some interest in the characters but they just weren t very believeable none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance the story is clearly dated and doesn t hold up well so many years later living in today s world it s hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry there definately is an audience for this book i m just not a part of it,negative
i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market edain mccoy who has written some wonderful new age material strikes an off putting note in this one the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements in several of her spreads she conveys that a card s placement at a certain point in the spread may or may not mean some karmic element at play the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define therefore when a card may or may not mean something that interpretation could significantly change on whether you may or may not interpret it that way leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card s meaning tarot cards are intuitive not rational and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position may or may not be the root of the issue these spreads speak very clearly to the author but not so to the reader i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives but the explanations are too ambiguous,negative

ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300 page book and so does author valerie hemingway s story for that reason this book merits only two stars early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19 valerie is aware of the author s magnetic and dominant personality around him everything came to life there was an urgency and vitality that did not ebb when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway this is an endearing look at the older struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of a moveable feast but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject as a result her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a e hotchner s papa hemingway the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain paris key west cuba and america share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway s strange son gregory \( apparently the other bull referred to in the title \) it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway even in death and over 40 years later that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man,negative
as china re emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world oddly the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao s disastrous reign even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge heavily populated and \( from a western perspective \) oftentimes strange land aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country on a recent trip to china i was highly impressed by the deep generosity humility resourcefulness strength perseverance and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith this spirit is also i believe one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese also those who are concerned that a christian china would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way,positive
in his recently published history the whiskey rebellion william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn he has an axe to grind and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion the argument is that because hamilton s patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen s resistance and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion the problem with hogeland s argument is his scholarship or lack there of he almost never offers a direct quote especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance instead hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote the reader is expected to accept on faith the author s interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end not all of this is hogeland s fault the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop even doris kearns goodwin a legitimate scholar is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze ultimately this is the main problem with william hogeland he is not a scholar he is a magazine writer with an agenda and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history because there is no basis in reality,negative
this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous lies my teacher told me could have been an amazing book but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor the only reason i didn t give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good but the book as a whole is just far too biased,negative
this book gives the reader a fascinating and personal look inside not just the foster care system but why they are very much so needed young dave s life was very likely saved by being taken from his mother s home and placed into foster care but this book makes it clear that despite this positive change in is life it certainly didn t mean everything was happily ever after dave then struggled with issues ranging from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years olds know by that age ranging from as simple as how to take a proper bath to how to behave with proper manners it also gives you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes and parents go through they deal day in and day out with children coming from troubled homes and these foster homes are in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim i think many of us myself included are unaware of just what a struggle it is for both the foster children and the foster parents as well as how much we need to support these people they are dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause thanks again dave for having the courage to share your beautiful story of heartache and triumph with us,positive

whether you re planning to read through crowley s book of thoth for the first time or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it this book is going to be equally useless to you several of crowley s diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly but sadly that s the only good thing about this book the book is filled with a lot of fluff duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley s and harris lives and constantly excuses and defends crowley s character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley s works so perhaps its some sort of atonement but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley s character through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid unfortunately duquette doesn t do this his background information is base and scarce he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this duquette doesn t give nearly enough information to understand crowley s works and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley s work duquette outright fails at times it seems as if duquette doesn t even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck i don t think the man even understands tarot in general \( and duquette s own tarot deck is evidence of this too \) at his best duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette s work a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level reading through the book of thoth there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better crowley s phonetic translation of the i ching doesn t follow the current standard and sometimes the differences are confusing especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching a key showing crowley s translation and the standard translation would ve been helpful likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth and what he did write is hard to find a chapter explaining crowley s views on astrology would ve been great if that wasn t possible then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful however duquette s solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read duquette s book isn t useful as a reference to crowley s work duquette doesn t seem to understand crowley most of the time and fails to adequatley explain crowley s ideas besides some new agey nonsense like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays duquette doesn t offer any new ideas or insights into crowley s work except for a few nice diagrams \( which are common enough and easy to find \) there isn t anything worthwhile contained in this book at least not anything you won t get out of reading crowley s book of thoth,negative

i respect the message of the unexpected legacy of divorce but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce unexpected those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time they fell apart due to abuse infidelity and just plain incompatibility what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority who constantly disappoints hurts and replaces the kids there will be damage no getting away from it however is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids seemingly with the other parent s approval i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married this is a major flaw in the research i didn t see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference i don t think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid s whether it s divorce or starting a new life afterward kids will suffer i don t like studies like this they re misleading and potentially damaging,negative

this book was so simplistic i was quite disappointed you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all a worthy goal but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit he really held back from delving into any dark territory his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit he always managed to put a happy positive spin on everything which is nice but life isn t that simple,negative

i had no prior experience with music playing \( other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica \) and yet i found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn from it smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing starting with one hand playing but quickly to two hands then chords etc and ending with sharp and flat notes it is well organized has well thought out exercises advices and a diverse collection of \( short \) attractive tunes of increasing complexity \( from jingle bells to waltzing matilda to silent night to green sleeves to we shall overcome to minuet in g minor \) i prefer it to other teach yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills such as the complete piano player or piano for dummies i particularly like that it gets to two hand playing almost right away which i feel is better preparation even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially it may have helped \( coordination wise \) that i have been typing for 20 years with both hands if you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way then i recommend this book if you perfer a slower pace then maybe look elsewhere for me this was the perfect book to learn from,positive

carlton mellick the 3rd s punk land \( a pseudo sequel to his 2001 novel satan burger \) wastes no time in getting straight to the story it is set in an alternate heaven for punks where sid vicious is god and you are judged for entry not by st peter but rather a number of gate attendants who decide whether or not you are punk enough mellick s trademark off beat humor and sideways take on religion is ever present along with a slew of philosophical ideas mixed with a juvenile sense of mischief although it is a sequel it stands completely on it s own fans of satan burger will appreciate the references and the continued story of nan and mortician but new readers aren t left wondering about a back story and anyone with even a slight interest in punk rock or punk culture will be in well punk heaven with all the references to punk history and culture and appearances by icons including g g allin henry rollins and johnny rotten the book is also full of illustrations diagrams photos and lists which help to give it a wonderful multimedia type feel you ll find yourself torn between finishing the paragraph you re in and jumping directly over to the flier for the pbr pogo joust advertised on the next page this is a great book a sublimely goofy sort of work that is effortlessly good but never takes itself too seriously highly recommended for anyone who likes mellick s work but even more so for anyone who has never read any of his books this is a great place to discover the works of a young groundbreaking author who is only getting better with time,positive
this is a wonderful book aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the all too often misunderstood post partum depression symptoms while i am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others i urge brooke shields to re consider a comment she made recently she indicated that while she knows now that post partum depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support she does not believe that adhd exists nor that it requires the same level of support it is essential that such public figures realize that what they have experienced is not the only form of reality thousands suffer with adhd in ways that interfere with their livlihood schooling relationships and self esteem issues studies have shown this challenge to be as real and as debilitating as post partum depression so please brooke don t deny the realities of other maladies simply because you haven t experienced them you of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others your voice is heard loudly your message must be correct thank you,positive

when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy and truthfully it s not a horrible book it is entertaining the style works etc on that note if you re looking for a fun read and don t plan on thinking about it too much then by all means get it my problem with the book is that it doesn t deserve all the acclaim it s getting if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio political situation of america this is not your book probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it s heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female packer has very little new to say and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers but have also have been said better by those authors drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you can t keep a good woman down a book that while having its own problems would probably be a better use of your time and money if you re really interested in the social commentary in the text even from the literary standpoint it s not terribly outstanding the characters are stereotypes the plots are predictable the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person an intelligent outsider who struggles with race religion and fitting in and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so the other protagonists are the same just not so irritable similar to this lack of variation in her characters packer varies little in her narrative style yes the language is pretty at times but there is no experimentation with language or structure all of the writing is in a highly generic voice finally the stories themselves contain scenes that aren t necessary and that detract from the actual narrative in short drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn t actual talent but how much your publisher backs you packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out,negative
the sub title of this book is very misleading it does not contain an action oriented approach to raising your self esteem unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page \( one of the things i dislike about myself is one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is \) and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper and there are a lot of them so be prepared to go through a lot of paper sure completing sentences technically counts as an action but if you re like me action oriented implies some sort of cognitive behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy but alas the practice helped me in no way your mileage may vary but i wouldn t recommend this book to anyone,negative

gerd ludemann writes historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead we must acknowledge a worldwide historical hoax \( 190 \) a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support three streams of thought permeate the resurrection of christ gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish invent or explain away peter and paul experienced hallucination and vision experiences proceeding from self deception belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter christian polemic in his chapter translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles purpose and tradition reworked \( re gospel writers \) and historical elements in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic or perhaps \( he intimates \) to cover up some element of embarrassment for example ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council \( which condemned jesus \) but that mark \( earliest gospel \) likely invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus but ludemann needs to discredit such notions for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb ludemann s case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances ludemann gets carried away with himself when he in tabloid fashion suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to disinfect a tradition of a dishonorable burial of jesus this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew mark and luke of being anti jewish \( refer to the ridiculous appendix 3 \) is christianity a history of self deception ludemann invests in the rather high risk prospect of hallucination for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus multiple appearances even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text \( vs 3 5 \) to the early 30 s ad the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection three physical events also the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination as well as being hugged ludemann though convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions introduces hallucination what accounts for these hallucinations peter s vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning \( 165 \) paul s event had a character of light and like the vision of john happened in the spirit i e in ecstasy \( 47 \) but paul does not report i was in the spirit as john does \( see revelation 1 \) john is deliberately conveying a non physical experience paul is not when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual in the spirit experience he does so in terms appropriate to that experience \( 2 corinthians 12 2 \) so we have record of paul s ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages modern depth psychology to explain paul s conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to apostle in chief of a new program of salvation \( 170 171 \) so we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul s subconscious state than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death burial empty tomb and appearances ludemann s examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural historians look for the best explanation of the evidence yet ludemann writes who decides at what point of historical study a theological explanation ought to begin \( 201 \) this is rife with misunderstanding one need only confirm that an event occurred in history regardless of theological implications also simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism \( thus supernaturalism \) is an entirely logical proposition yet ludemann quotes another author the disciples believed in phantoms imagined that they were surrounded by miracles took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time \( 175 \) this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection we should abandon christianity sadly he reaches the wrong conclusion self deluded by a proliferation of one can imagine seems to indicate likely enough and one thus suspects reasoning ludemann boasts accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision \( 210 \) may the reader decide otherwise,negative
i loved the core knowledge curriculum the reason i switched my children to a charter school is that they started out teaching ck i also switched them back to the public school when the principal got away from ck and made it just like a public school i agree that a teacher should supplement what is in the ck books to give their students a better understanding of the material teaching the information exactly how it is presented in the books would be very dry however ck is a great outline of what should be taught it covers a tremendous amount of knowledge including the fight for civil rights all religious ideology multicultural literature and more if there is a problem with the books it is that many children would not be motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered for many it would be too much also weak teachers would be overwhelmed trying to cover everything hence anyone claiming that ck supports a racist philosophy has never read the books also i want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist misspelled the word it is not spelled rasist i also find it disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher when attending school maybe that teacher would have benefited from a core knowledge foundation,positive

having read detective comics 471 479 in the 70s done by this same creative team i picked this up hoping for more of the same what a let down i have to ask what happened the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest most detailed art i d ever seen in a comic book i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin when he was working on x men he gave john bryne s pencils that fine detail as well has austin done a gil kane and given up his nib and ink to work with marker pen this dark detective series shows none of the fine ness of his previous work you only have to compare the flash backs of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong maybe austin or rogers are getting older but the artwork is very basic and lacks the sheen they used to produce the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane s early work the story also is a little unbelievable it portrays bruce as a love sick puppy and just doesn t ring true also the lettering is well it s been hand done by rogers i surmise and is quite uneven it should have been done by computer i m sorry i so wanted to like this but it s nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s,negative

while this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses i cannot recommend it to other readers the author unfortunately perpetuates the right wing republican only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical christianity she battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel indeed in reading some of the chapters it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a christian worldview that might veer in any part from republican platform positions this is really too bad because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions i would not have begrudged her political point of view at all had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position,negative

a singularly dull book the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung a south victorious with modern weapons seemed too trivial the author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not the character of robert e lee in the book is just too too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts i finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that i put it down halfway through i am not sure if it turns out the way i think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other,negative
am i the only one who didn t get a complete book at first i noticed there was some poor editing lots of typos but then after page 180 where page 181 should be \( sleep chapter \) it goes back to page 117 \( discipline chapter that i already read \) it continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 \( a whole 63 pages duplicated \) then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the school days chapter that i don t have the beginning of i m completely missing pages 181 245 \( 67 pages \) other than that good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas,negative

of all of willard s books this one was my favorite willard offers a systematic study of the nature of being and then proposes a pragmatic approach to setting the hear back on course to purity and submission to god a human being he says \( p 30 \) is composed of thought feeling choice body social context and soul he states plainly \( p 41 \) it is the central point of this book that spiritual transformation only happens as each essential dimension of the human being is transformed to christlikeness under the direction of a regenerate will interacting with the constant overtures of grace from god such transformation is not the result of mere human effort and cannot be accomplished by putting pressure on the will \( heart spirit \) alone fundamental to this project is first dying to self taking up the cross and living in self denial \( chapter 4 \) we must then go through a process like learning a new language the general steps he summarizes in the acronym vim vision intention means \( p 85 \) these are a vision for kingdom life the will to do it and the means to carry it out the rest of the book is structured around a look at the transformation of the mind \( chapters 6 7 \) will \( 8 \) body \( 9 \) social context \( 10 \) and the soul \( 11 \) the work of the mind involves being cognizant of the ideas and feelings that drive our society and our personal lives instead we should be renewed with love joy and peace in the inner life the work of the will involves surrendering our will to god s and then moving from abandonment to contentment here the spiritual disciplines bring to light our duplicity on these matters the work of the body means realizing the over emphasis we place on it and the need to cease idolizing and misusing our bodies the work of our social context involves noting the use of assault and withdrawal that characterizes our relationships \( p 181 \) lastly the work of the soul which willard defines as the unifying factor of them all is best summarized in psalm 1 we are to be renewed into new beings who happily fulfill the law of god again i said this was my favorite of willard s works i m not sure any of the rest of them so thoroughly transcend from the theological to the practical without missing a step the systematic study of human nature is all inclusive he lays out a blueprint of a kingdom vision of what the human being \( emphasis on being \) is the very nature of humanity from the state in which we find it to the place it is supposed to be is spelled out here the enormity of the work is amazing for such a readable text,positive
art is a young man fresh out of college and has a curious set of friends arthur an attractive gay man the enigmatic phlox with whom arthur works and the distinctly odd hedonist cleveland art is uncertain of his sexuality being torn between arthur and phlox cleveland is a threat to the stability of anyone with whom he comes into contact the mysteries of pittsburgh was a well received yet while at times i found it entertaining and witty in truth it s a very bumpy piece of work in which the characters don t really convince the plot is unconvincing from the first and descends into absurdity towards the end in summary it reads very much as a first effort perhaps an experiment but i found it baffling that anyone could consider it a mature piece of prose g rodgers,negative
yuck this book was totally boring well maybe you ll like it if you re like 7 or 8 years old or something not only is it totally boring but poorly written which surprised me because ann m martin is certainly not a bad writer i m really glad she left the bsc and started writing a new series about them the bsc books are soo boring and childish please a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds don t waste your time reading the bsc books they are all pretty dumb,negative

i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years i was born raised in the north i think evans should rename his book fiddler on the roof in the south his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history as it was in the past here it s very much the southern jews were all so happy they all fit in and were accepted etc he does cite a few instances where they had problems but these usually involved us yankee jews like the instances when a few \( yankee \) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights evans should realize that times have really changed here the evangelical christians in my town \( which is most people here \) harrass me like crazy i am praying for you have you read the words of jesus who was a jew like you when will you come to my church blah blah blah thank god for the minority of catholics methodists presbyterians and a few others who live here they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am and the way i will stay a jew i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences and that they cannot relate to what i am saying but i do want to ask evans a few questions 1 \) if things are so great for the jews in the south why have you lived in new york for decades now 2 \) why don t you at least write either a new forward to the book a magazine article etc contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time \( for some of us at least \) primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians i read evans books before i moved here and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here for a jew who really cares about her his religion living here is depressing it is practically jew less and at best the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me \( by the way i am planning to move to a city \) by the way don t bother writing to me to tell me that i am wrong or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church believe me with all the praying for me that is going on in this town and all the myriad attempts to convert me if it hasn t happened by now as they say in these parts it just ain t gonna happen,negative
i bought this book just recently and was really touched \( and cried \) by the whole experience that gus had went through he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance \( stephanie \) and without her he could ve been out there on the street again overall it s a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another this book is a genuine prove,positive
i think that the beginning of the book was the worst part he started by telling us that he was leaving and wasn t going to tell anyone he didn t even say goodbye to a lady friend so he tells us that he s leaving and then he goes back into the past back when he was a little kid he tells about different experiances how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years he tells about all the troubles that his family went through the end was the best part i usually hate the endings but this one was good this bool is meant for older people who like english books or is it ireland i think it was set in irelan,positive
carson mccullers one of america s greatest southern writers was often misunderstood as many people were put off by or unwilling to deal with her \( at the time \) controversial subject matter mccullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience the loneliness and isolation of her gothic like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have though magnified and intensified to the nth degree tennessee williams in his introduction to mccullers reflections in a golden eye posed the question \( in a mock dialogue \) most people asked about writers of the gothic school such as carson mccullers flannery o connor katherine anne porter and eudora welty why do they write about such dreadful things williams replies in my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society why have they got to use symbols of the grotesque and the violent because a book is short and a man s life is long the awfulness has to be compressed mccullers unlike any writer i have ever read pierces the heart of themes such as love isolation and loneliness with her lucid poetic prose tennessee williams in virginia spencer carr s biography of mccullers summed up mccullers writing as follows i have used the word heart but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of carson mccullers genius i believe in fact i know that there are many many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it and therefore carson mccullers is what i would call a necessary writer she owned the heart and the deep understanding of it but in addition she had that tongue of angels that gave her power to sing of it to make of it an anthem,positive

a commentary on a book of the bible will generally include the commentator s outline of the structure of that book a good outline can greatly enhance one s understanding of a biblical book so such outlines are important rarely though do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived this book which is based on professor lee s doctoral dissertation describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text this method called conceptual analysis is a modern version of form criticism developed by lee s advisor rolf knierim lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes one then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text finally the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed lee demonstrates the method on num 10 11 36 13 a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways he divides this section into 36 units discussing with each one the rationale for his choices he then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is num 13 1 14 45 the account of the exploration of the promised land by 12 scouts the largely negative report the scouts present to the people and israel s subsequent rejection of god s plan to bring them into the promised land the pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a scientific process with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text there is no way to completely mechanize such a process however some subjectivity is inevitable and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others in my opinion one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text by this criterion i believe that lee s outline of num 10 11 36 13 earns high marks his outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text as he explains in the latter stages of the book it is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists this book is a notable exception and i enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of numbers,positive
this series may be good for a laugh some of the writing is engaging but the premise is absurd why in this day and age should anyone accept the world view of the bible a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe s beliefs and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt sinai in a sense bible believers have been left behind since the 1700s enlightenment tom paine s the age of reason showed the god of the bible to be a cruel vindictive monster and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations the ravings of a madman read this series if you like enjoy parts of it but make no mistake to take any of this seriously you have to regress to a prehistoric world view before men learned to think to ask questions before logic or science a time when dazed superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth if they didn t grovel humbly enough to their supposed god do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one when the sheep are raptured up to heaven their clothes are left behind so heaven is a nudist colony the basic contradiction of course lies in using worldly action \( some of it exciting \) to proselytize for the unworldly the supernatural but why should we care whether any of the good guys gets killed and why should they mind won t they go straight up to heaven that s what they want isn t it why even lift a finger against the bad guys didn t christ say resist not evil worried about who will win god is infinitely powerful so jesus \( who is 1 3 of god or something like that \) is sure to win when armageddon rolls around in book 12 of the series and the sheep the believers will happily worship him looking just like the pictures of dim witted bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah s witnesses leave at your door the going price for a used copy of tribulation force is one cent does that tell you something actually the story telling is worth more the basic premise is worth less perhaps it averages out,negative

i am ashamed to say i read this entire book i kept hoping it would get better but it didn t it is filled with typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics clarkson actually spells mel gibson s name wrong several times throughout the book and refers to lethal weapon director richard donner as dormer for several pages he jumps back and forth from one movie production to another making it difficult to follow lastly he relies on the accounts of people who had met mel gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional conflict with him in the retelling of these conflicts and what went down we hear one point of view only and generally that is the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment towards gibson so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy the best part of the book is the end for two reasons clarkson finally gets to gibson s most recent project the passion of the christ the subtitle and the picture on the back of the book gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the book but after 300 pages of reading i was still waiting for the subject to come up i have to say i felt that this was the only well written part of the whole book thoughtful and interesting the second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it was finally over i m sorry to be so blunt but i can t help it i highly recommend reading the book about the making of the passion of the christ you can learn a lot about gibson there but i cannot recommend this biography,negative

polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant radical and all too plausible theory in this book going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about polanyi s answer will not be pleasing to libertarians he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention and must be sustained through further intervention he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations usually economic relations were a result of social relations under the market it is the latter polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain his argument that government enclosures created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing however other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments polanyi s argument that there was no rent seeking \( he doesn t use that term \) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy \( proving that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect one 19th century investigators conclusions don t serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi doesn t do too much to back up his arguments he fortunately has a section called notes and sources where he lists his research material but i d wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later,positive

luc ferry raises some very important and pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an authoritarian social structure does deep ecology demand a level of political correctness which places its premises beyond question ferry is not the first to raise these questions the institute for social ecology led by murray bookchin has made the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter of course there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology but they do not make up the whole story particularly glaring is ferry s one sided depiction of eco feminism in fact some eco feminist work in the u s has been particularly sharp at questioning the orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism the questions which occupy ferry should be asked by every person who is involved in radical ecology and many of his criticisms are on target for a specific body of work but he doesn t bother to see the whole picture and readers should be careful to read beyond the quotes cited by ferry and to study deep ecology and ecofeminism on their own terms,positive
perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in english \( or at least it appears to have been there is no translator listed \) but this is by far the most lucid thing i ve read by latour in a way it s a radical break he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child actor network theory stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work,positive
eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work \( osd \) and academia \( naval war college and harvard \) i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well grounded work i was disappointed i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work the churchill chapter was the best cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done thought not rally tied to the focus of the book i learned the most from the ben gurion since i knew the least about him the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest,negative

seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that james frey fiasco anybody who now pens their auto bios have to first be as famous and beloved as billy crystal but then they can only put out the cotton candy coney island fluff as 700 sundays is granted the book is based on crystal s highly praised tony award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al but it s nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and or tide one over during the day and night kaddish yet in ripping a page out of billy s book it s not hard to imagine how that rapid fire exchange between him and his agent went it probably went something like hey bubby how about writing a book talking about your 700 sundays with your pop well i m not a writer per se i just jot down a few notes here and there and then go out and perform the material on stage so here s a few blank pages of paper write down what you have it ll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most and it

lot of white space toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album slap it all together between two hardcovers it ll be just fine yes but don t worry consider it like a vintage bottle

this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front across the region known as flanders three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling bombing machine gun fire gas attacks and wretched weather conditions in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down it is a shame so many historians including such military writers as david glantz do not emulate groom s style,positive
amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization the corporation look moral only someone like al capone could sympathize with this group on the oregon how can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the oregon the us apparently is willing to finance the group but the us also financed sadam noriega unfortunately in this sense it is too much like real american policy which absolutely disgusts me \( the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind as long as they are not righteous americans \) the characters are clich there is no suspense since everything goes as planned and anyone in the crew can just about do anything including being a successful rock band it makes me look back on the dirk pitt books and wonder about dirk s morality,negative

for the english language reader wedgwood s book which has been in print for over sixty years is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of european history it gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations the principal antagonists at the outset ferdinand ii of austria and frederick v elector palatine the condottieri style generals spinola von mansfeld tilly wallenstein piccolomini christian of halberstadt bernhard of saxe weimar the duc d enghien \( conde \) the contentious minor rulers maximilian v of bavaria johann georg of saxony the northern monarchs christian iv of denmark and gustavus adophus of sweden \( and his daughter christina and prime minister oxenstierna \) the spoiler cardinal richelieu the new emperor ferdinand iii and his cousin the warlord cardinal infant ferdinand of spain and many others this book is written in a traditional english historian s prose style that is clear eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories while still covering these aspects of the period in spite of some reviewers claims of a protestant bias in her interpretation the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long running disaster of the war taking the position that it was the self serving political interests of the participants \( dynasties rulers generals and paymasters \) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of germany and bohemia although i am not familiar with this new edition \( and grafton s introduction \) i emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the holy roman empire during the sixteenth century with a special emphasis on the composition of the bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the habsburg king emperors the extent and internal organization of the bohemian crown lands should also be outlined a succinct review of the political status of lutheranism calvinism the bohemian brethren and other protestant confessions throughout all of europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in setting the stage for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious denomination consequences of the war the author supplies sufficient details on the major battles but this is not a work of military history as wedgwood knows battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences and it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war \( including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes \) that wedgwood excels in her analysis of the general european situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events each was a source of conflict and each might cross cut the others complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved in brief the forces were \( a \) religion with three major competing factions \( catholic lutheran calvinist she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the roman catholic church \) \( b \) nationalism \( french german czech etc \) which was a new force on the scene crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality \( which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language \) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests \( c \) monarchic constitutional issues which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the constitutional grouping of major and minor powers known as the holy roman empire \( hre \) the constitutional problem was twofold within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout europe \( duchies counties free city areas ruled by town councils and mayors \) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers powers and privileges were taking place aristocrats oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies \( estates \) reluctant to cede their own powers \( taxation the organization of military service \) to a central authority the same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the hly roman epire that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected emperor \( who had been a habsburg for several centuries \) and the smaller rulerships of central europe the religious reforms rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio eius religio \( whoever rules his religion is the religion of the ruled area \) in the year of the war s inception 1618 this new balance was very fragile comprising four catholic and three protestant imperial electors in germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the emperor \( resident in vienna or prague \) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals especially the protestant electors had been somewhat codified by the augsburg treaty of 1555 and were known as the german liberties these would prove to be especially important to the three protestant electors at the outset of the war in the developing continental war one could be pro or anti habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them for example a catholic ruler \( including the papacy \) might seek protestant allies in order to combat habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the empire which affected his position adversely or a protestant power might accept the habsburg program in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage \( this characterization is apt for saxony and brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war \) as wedgwood notes all three considerations \( religion nationality constitutional relations \) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions from the point of view of rationality or predictability political choices and commitments were often self contradictory \( e g a catholic power supporting a protestant venture a german liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power etc \) or temporary expedients that made the overall european situation more chaotic the war began locally in bohemia but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as spain and england \( even farther to the caribbean naval theater \) as far north as sweden and northeast to poland as far south as italy and southeast as transylvania in other words it was a european continental war with global impact when the war broke out in 1618 it was over the habsburg violation of a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom in bohemia \( the concessions stated in rudolf ii s letter of majesty \) and here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role ferdinand ii who had knowingly violated the terms of the letter soon after being selected by the bohemian diet as king \( and therefore the first in precedence of the hre electors \) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the habsburg dynasty in bohemia and elsewhere he was firmly committed to the goals of the catholic counter reformation \( i e re catholicizing all of the areas within the hre which had become protestant during the last one hundred years \) when he was deposed by a special convention of the bohemian estates \( the defenestration of his deputies in prague being the signal event of this deposition \) the crown of bohemia was offered to the elector of the \( rhineland \) palatinate frederick v who considered himself a champion of the protestant cause the religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war given the other major conflict hovering in the background the spanish habsburg determination to recover the now protestant area of the netherlands which had become the successful and defiant \( dutch \) united provinces the war soon became international while the entry of france and then denmark followed by sweden into the war during the 1620 s changed its nature and extended its duration wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two protestant electors johann georg of saxony and georg wilhelm of brandenburg and one catholic ruler maximilian of bavaria it is her contention throughout the book that johann georg and maximilian in particular could have prevented the war s spread and forced ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand despite their religious differences these two were always strong german liberties proponents and each had the same view of the austrian habsburg rulers they should be kept for the broader protections they offered but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers in the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals \( saxony switched sides and joined the swedes for several years while maximilian s position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies the french as their potential foot in the habsburg camp \) wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of germany wedgwood s gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great power politics and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists her summary of the changes emphasizes the following \( a \) religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war religion was becoming more interiorized and private and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science \( this was the era of galileo and kepler with descartes harvey hook newton huygens etc on the near horizon a time of laboratory science and scientific societies \) as the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about \( b \) for thinking men nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action this was very obvious in france but even true of ferdinand iii for whom the new main cause was the construction of an austrian based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the holy roman imperial protector of far flung german catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile in the minds of both germans and austrian habsburgs the holy roman empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in germany the elbe north german pomeranian ideal empire of wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program austria began to move south and east \( toward italy croatia and hungary \) in its expansionist aims \( c \) the control of immense polyglot multi religious mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent mobile states unto themselves cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad they changed sides the most successful mercenary generals had become mini sovereigns officers were all out for themselves and for their troops \( rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster \) since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement the most famous commanders ernst von mansfeld wallenstein bernhard of saxe weimar the swedish general wrangel all expected \( and some received \) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service the national armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem the pace of the war wound down during its last five years \( although there were several major battles fought even then \) which was a period of extended negotiatons in m nster and osnabr ck with the final treaty being signed late in 1648 for the next five years a series of conferences met at n rnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies many of the loans of this period which were raised to cover the demobilization costs were not paid off for a century individual rulers such as charles of lorraine and the duke of savoy \( who got nothing from the treaty \) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years but the war did not break out again france and spain continued at war with each other but not in germany numerous soldiers especially officers went into mercenary service all over europe others took to the hills as professional bandits for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of germany and bohemia in armed caravans wedgwood accepts the more recent \( 1900 1930 s \) historical estimate that the population of the imperial german lands \( excluding alsace and the netherlands \) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648 the number of dislocated people was also substantial while she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other infrastructural and economic losses were very large she feels that all contemporary sources \( e g the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years \) exaggerated local losses since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution the free peasantry benefited briefly since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates prices fell while wages rose for a number of years which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans but within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with imperial royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re create bonded serf like conditions for peasants town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants \( e g prohibitions against mobility domestic industry and household craft production a trend which later historians refer to as neo serfdom \) class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started there was a new large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court backed military and bureaucratic appointments at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers germany and the austrian based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing atlantic trade for a number of years the outlets of germany s major rivers \( rhine elbe oder and for brandenburg prussia vistula \) were controlled by foreign powers reducing germany s commercial strength hamburg was the exception becoming the major maritime merchant city of the north sea coast at the expense of the other hanseatic cities and the scandinavian powers the only medium sized german state to emerge with positive prospects was brandenburg soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful prussia the peace while ending the wars of religion set the stage for a long series of nationalistic wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict france replaced the habsburg spanish austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace austria turned to the south and east and spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater there was no politically or culturally unified germany within the boundaries of the old empire \( french culture began to reign supreme \) and the cosmopolitanism \( its openness to outside influences \) of this area during the 18th century instead of being a source of pride over its achievements became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived german nationalism author s judgment and conclusions in terms of responsibility for the overall disaster wedgwood points to the futility and self destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of ferdinand ii and the elector palatine but from the point of view of failures of practical \( and ethical \) politics she highlights the behavior of maximilian and johann georg who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a unified german program which would have forced imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it between these two she sees the saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances \( pressed by the swedish juggernaut \) and therefore less culpable for the mess while she judges the bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow germans thus identifying him as the more culpable beautiful in its style and concision wedgwood s final summary is also gloomy \( as one might expect of a work completed in 1939 on the verge of world war ii \) as there was no compulsion towards a conflict which in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame so no right was vindicated by its ragged end the war solved no problem its effects both immediate and indirect were either negative or disastrous morally subversive economically destructive socially degrading confused in its causes devious in its course futile in its result it is the outstanding example in european history of meaningless conflict,positive
i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times i got to around page 20 or so i ll probably try again however if you re an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you ll know what objectivism is about i wouldn t suggest it for teens that haven t had any prior readings though objectivism is about the self and about reason and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous i assume that s in my head but judge for yourself her caricatures of the witch doctor \( who controls others from a spiritual perspective \) and attila \( who controls by brute force \) are actually interesting wrong but interesting since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival \( or think they do anyway \) it s rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand \( she s not wrong on everything \) or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills judging by previous reviews it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers if you buy into it you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo intellectual way if you don t buy into it however you re evil \( either the witch doctor or attila \) and probably just too stupid to get it why i didn t finish it yet i just couldn t get past her ignorance of history frankly if you re writing a work of fiction the historical innacuracies don t matter but this isn t supposed to be fiction i like history and most people don t so it probably won t bother most people also while she denounces religion ms rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself like all other religions and cults the world is messed up basically because people don t think like she does,negative

this book gave me insight into german culture it is no wonder there was a holocaust with children s books like these max and moritz are adventurous children and they are caught being caught isn t enough they are ground in a flour mill for punishment not even that suits the miller he feeds their remains to the ducks it instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap this story will forever give nightmares,negative

at first i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story especially since i work as a mental health professional as i keep reading i discovered that it wasn t sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child and of the intrusive nature of the media i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict despite her past history of nervous breakdown and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man the secondary characters were all wonderful in particular mariah s mother and the lawyers on both side i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story as with all picoult books this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn t easily breezed through but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read,positive

i don t know what to say about this book it is the single worst book i have ever read in my young life i feel like i ve witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it i would say at some point in the book maybe about halfway every line of dialogue every characterization every plot point is absolutely terrible this book is truly an offense to literacy and i cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash i can only imagine that robin cook either allowed a child to write this book or was chronically drunk while writing it either that or he has lost his faculties altogether i have read children s essays that have been better written while it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book the highlights are knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery cliche mania with lines like i going to get to the bottom of this mystery and when the character s discover something giving each other high fives racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions own guns and play basketball stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros nyc coroners fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body \( also paying for their friends to come too \) wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working and asking questions and getting answers to them real easy incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes \( i e making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them \) the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending i got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it if anyone thinks this book is better than two stars they need their head examined,negative

if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u s as kurlansky attempts in this book the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year the reader is owed specifics yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent but prohibited it chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government however flawed resulting from open debate a bigger difference could hardly be imagined but kurlansky does see striking differences albeit only in the post 1968 world the soviet bloc began it s decent to oblivion while the capitalist west avoided the same his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean though what manner of revolution he envisions is never rendered to specifics likely for good reason but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do,negative
this is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author the book is poorly researched poorly written and well words just fail me while i am not a great herriot fan i do have to give him his due the man could write well and could tell a good story \( isn t that what authors are suppose to do \) but this guy graham lord i suspect has problems feeding paper into his typewriter the intire book is such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a dead and popular author it is rather nauseating shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work i did finish the book though \( thank god i did not purchase the thing \) because each page became worse and worse and i could not stop thinking with each turn of the page well it just cannot be any worse than that last page chapter how wrong i was if you must read the thing borrow it or check it out of a library i would hate to see a person waste their money and i certainly would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this herriot s life warts and all could be such a fastinating subject i do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually we certainly did not get it here,negative

from what i gather edward abbey has somewhat of a cult following i had never read anything by the guy never even heard of him before i got this book i just thought i should point that out before going on this book kept me reading no doubt about that it has it s downsides but overall i d reccomend it not hey you gotta read this right now but it s good if you re looking for something a little different this book kind of made me think i m not the kind of guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every aspect of it but i couldn t help it with this story i thought a lot of it was psychological dealing with the main character his thoughts attitudes and what made him tick this is a fairly long book but the actual story of the guy going back to his hometown is short the plot alternates every chapter one about where he presently is and then a memory then where he is then another memory and so on although it was an interesting way to write the book i thought some of the memory sequences dragged a bit but don t get me wrong overall i did enjoy them if you re looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of thoughts about life this is a good bookt to pick up,positive

having read a few bosch books already \( the closers and lost light \) i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series however i was very disappointed with this book one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors \( mispellings and such \) i found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages \( before i stopped reading \) i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book also i found the book to be too gritty it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order connelly s writing seems to be getting better and better which should explain why i didn t enjoy this book and couldn t finish it i gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order,negative

the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948 i am not questioning mosley s portrayal of racism however i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948 and the answer is not very there may have been poverty racism alcholism but l a county seemed pretty safe the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find 1827 mosley may have been more familiar with l a of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way throw in speakeasies gangsters hijacking liquor trucks and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928 i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate but many many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life era place that had not been shown before from what i can tell he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s \( i guess those years average to be about 1948 \) mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation however i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic and i hope readers realize that it is not easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak but unfortunately large group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect that is interesting to read detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via confession easy does solve one of the murders on his own but just about everything he solves is simply confessed to him i find that extremely dissatisfying mosley has packed the book with violence but seems to know very little about violence himself none of the fights are well described easy for being a self professed killing machine can t actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them they are either big or they are small he does not come of as being hard boiled but rather a pathetic braggart mosley does show signs of being a very good writer but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional i imagine that his work must have improved but this effort is nothing to get exceited over and again i don t obsess over accuracy but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel,negative

i have been slogging through this book for weeks now it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich s excellent book on byzantium the book lacks any narrative thrust often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author s obvious agenda to set the record straight and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its barbaric european contemporaries,negative
while previous guides for the serial drama lost have often left something to be desired the book finding lost the unofficial guide more than makes up for it nikki stafford s attention to detail \( and believe me all lost fans should have a great attention to detail \) is thus far unparalleled in any other guide book you name it this guide book has it in addition to the usual episode synopsis stafford provides readers with all the information they can handle including keeping track of the appearances of the numbers discussing theories pointing out bloopers and continuity errors illuminating connections and just generally proving that she has watched way more lost than any of us in addition to all that stafford gives the low down on each of the lost cast members before they became losties even if you have watched each episode of lost 4 or 5 times and think you have caught every little nuance and clue hidden within it i guarentee you ll read this book and discover things you didn t catch or never thought of one of my favorite features in this book is the essay that details and explains everything on the invisible map that locke briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode lock down when the blast door comes down on top of his legs and a black light switches on illuminating the secret map bottom line this book is a must have for serious lost fans it would also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get into lost,positive

walzer s historical approach to examining just war theory is i think the most useful way to understand morality in war that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying if not prescribing moral norms from which the rules have been extracted be forewarned he does not cut the reader any slack this book requires some serious attention to the author s train of thought just war theory has two categories the justice of going to war and the justice of fighting once in a war walzer s discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that all is fair in love and war that is the path of least moral resistance \( or as clausewitz would say friction \) yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age old notion something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected yet it remains a prevailing idea for many originally coined by the romans it seems \( walzer quotes them in war the laws are silent \) they themselves were self consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist far from it on the otherside some critics find his argument about supreme emergency a moral failure and a cop out the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency one where normal rules may be relaxed if ever so little because of the especially pernicious nature of state sponsored genocide the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan for instance as having represented a supreme emergency and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell s perspective in the essay thank god for the atom bomb significantly for current events readers interested in the distinction between pre emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre emptive that impulse on the part of the neo conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects i think a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of pre emption michael walzer s well thought distinction between pre emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start regardless of its practical success down the road if we are fortunate enough to see that the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco where one fails to recognize the moral high ground one is doomed to moral failure walzer was vocal about the run up to war in 2003 and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world s police force,positive
this book is a must for anyone who works with older adults it is a photographic essay of some very special people people who embrace the robustness of life and who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as possible our world is steeped in ageism that is believing that older people are only capable of doing things that are appropriate for their age this book shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who continue doing what they love to do physically i wish that etta clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year i have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures that people give about aging it is a book to be owned not borrowed,positive
ethan mordden s editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs his political ramblings \( often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense \) seep through the book dragging it down the french people are slammed a number of times along with the aclu burt lancaster \( apparently according to ethan a good friend of stalin \) and the left in general while the author defends bush \( and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre \) the author s train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target any target it is often hard to stomach the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that it can actually make one want to look at the work again an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public the author is capable of better work,negative
the ny times book review linked this novel to the aftermath of 9 11 but that may have more to do with the preoccupation of new yorkers than with the story powers wrote while he does refer to 9 11 early on this book concerns environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong headed economic development in the great plains at the western edge of the midwestern farming belt it is about the struggle not to loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of america in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to the changing scale of agricultural operations but since it is a richard powers novel it is also about much more neuro physiology brain function as reflected in behavior and personality the devotion of a 30ish sister to her less able younger brother her sexual relations with two very different men and a nationally known writer \( clearly modeled on oliver sachs \) who has a late mid life crisis it is about love devotion and doing as much of the right thing as one can do it involves escape and return clearly powers should not be considered a regional writer his books have been set entirely or partly in brooklyn manhattan philadelphia l a the pacific northwest and the continent of europe but several books by powers are set in the midwest where he is based readers who know something of the areas in which those stories are set will gain an extra measure of appreciation for the skillful way powers incorporates subtle regional characteristics into these novels as others have said this is probably not the best novel this writer has given us although it is quite carefully plotted and full of the marvelous insights we have come to expect from him i prefer the goldbug variations three farmers on their way to a dance and despite my own musical illiteracy in the time of our singing but even when powers is not quite at his best he writes a better book than most novelists ever manage ever to produce read enjoy learn,positive

being a lover of freedom when the nazi revolution came i looked to the universities to defend it knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth but no the universities were immediately silenced then i looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom but they like the universities were silenced in a few short weeks only the church stood squarely across the path of hitler s campaign for suppressing the truth i never had any special interest in the church before but now i feel a great affection and admiration for it because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom i am forced to confess that what i once despised i now praise unreservedly albert einstein what i m getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad that s easy when you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily you may want to consider the source i e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution or maybe israel zolli chief rabbi of rome whose conversion to catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church s reaction to the plight of the jewish people this book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized it is important to read a work like this however in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author s motive,negative

this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre christian origins of the marian cult other resources however cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so called bvm the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church,positive

this book appears on most of the best of science fiction lists that various pundits and critics have put out even though it is not a very commonly known work does it deserve such a placing i think the answer to that depends upon what your viewpoint is about what science fiction as a form of literature is supposed to accomplish the idea is simple enough a new drug developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis is found to have the property of greatly increasing a person s intelligence but with major side effect it kills the user in about nine months the story follows one louis sacchetti a conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war and who would already be considered to be a genius by most standards as he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given this drug the story is told through the means of a journal that louis is encouraged almost forced to keep as this idea is extremely similar to that of daniel keyes flowers for algernon \( which was later made into the movie charly \) comparison is invited flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero a man who struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just himself but all mankind up against an unbeatable problem that of his own retreat to sub normal intelligence again camp concentration follows a completely different path that of the essential selfishness of the individual of nihilism of the despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful way the inmates that louis initially documents are apparently using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy as a means of providing immortality not for humanity in general but for themselves and the warden of this prison humphrey haast louis meanwhile seems caught up in crafting new poems and a play entitled auswitch a comedy the title is indicative of something disch does throughout this book playing with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words and is fairly effective in doing so the tone is the primary thing here a very dark brooding atmosphere enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many references both buried and open to other works of literature \( most especially dante \) and scientific and psychological theories readers who are not familiar with these references may feel a little lost at places in this book at least i did as my breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than disch s but from this tone disch develops his themes of the corruption of man of his baser desires the absolute horrors of what man is capable of and where such capacity leads as such this book is almost the complete antithesis of flowers for algernon that is until the ending of this book the ending of this book i felt rather drastically detracted from its overall message as it doesn t seem to fit with the rest and has a little of a deus ex machina feel to it given the many layered discourse that disch presented in the rest of the book which while sometimes difficult to follow was certainly excellent writing this ending was a disappointment while this is certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science fiction literature whether it truly qualifies as a classic will be i m afraid very much a matter of opinion for a long time to come but it is certainly worth reading if for nothing else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented reviewed by patrick shepherd \( hyperpat,positive

i m gonna quote a paragraph from the book please note in no way can this paragraph tell you anything about the book or spoil it for those who havent read it a woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling pirates with pistol her man in the battle s fray with his sword and shield standing victorious among corpses her man in a desert whose sands were on fire amid mountain peaks drinking the driven snow so long as he lived she would follow his journey would feel his elation and his grief and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart it would be the same for him in the midst of desert s fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear live live that was what the stories said about love that was what human beings knew love to be shalimar the clown was about as good as i thought it would be it definitely isn t the best book i ve read this year but i must say salman rushdie s writing style captivates me nonetheless in between the most relevant paragraphs he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader s mindset in this book he mentions a quote twice which really caught my eye one doesn t know the questions of life until one is asked another thing i noticed about the book is that the central character shalimar is seldom mentioned the book seems to hover around other dozen characters only in prison and in that one letter sent back to kashmira does shalimar s true character really come out the second quarter of the book got immensely boring and i really despise how max s character was written about it was annoying difficult to read over detailed and excruciating to read boonyi was an outstanding character so was the old witch and boonyi s father when colonel tortoise was mentioned in the book i thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything one couldn t help but dislike max s lack of integrity mythology is rather well written about in this book every 50 pages a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words conclusion while reading time and again i would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer s grasp on the reader is the writer knows his words where to use them he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever maybe this book disappointed his core fans maybe it lacked a spark enough to obilerate doubt all in all i can say that salman rushdie has a wierd way of his own his vocabulary is truly astounding maybe he is the most learned writer i ve ever read if not the best respect h s anand 17th october 06 12 13p,positive

dark tort was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read but for a novel that s supposed to be part of a quirky light mystery series i found things a bit leaden the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered and when we finally do move beyond that scene a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further i do admit that it also doesn t help that i m one of those people who can t suspend disbelief and have to ask so she s an off site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified but that s just me oh well many of the recipes did sound good though i doubt i ll get around to making any of them this is one of those reviews where it s probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series \( which i personally haven t read but suspect aren t much different than this one \) you ll likely enjoy this installment too the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b parker spenser novel for our light mystery fix,negative

thirty five years ago my high school \( thomas jefferson in federal way washington \) held annual competitions in mathematics they did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet just was a few pages long there weren t many questions perhaps a dozen or two \( usually in the form of story problems \) but they required deep thought and concentration \( at least for me \) i still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as i took the white book and opened it to the first problem several hours later i d consider myself accomplished if i d managed to completely answer more than half the questions ian stewart s book reminds me of those tests here s a sampling of what s inside 1 \) mrs anne lida worm decides she wants a new couch and tells mr worm to get it for her while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby wermintrude but anne lina doesn t want just any couch she wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house and around the 90 degree hall at the end what shape does the couch have and how big is it this is a truly riveting story will mr worm solve the couch problem in time 2 \) alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes evaluating the influence of different soils he wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine his land is on a hillside though which is narrow so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land how can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species where any two plots have exactly one variety in common and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot sixteen chapters make up this book though their titles are whimsical the mathematical problems aren t some are still unsolved even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions and developed insight along the way that are at once challenging and rewarding here s a sample of some of other topics discussed in stewart s book how might one transport a lion llama and head of lettuce in a boat across a lake without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker how can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve how can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place suppose that you need to tile a room and the tiles come in odd shapes is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution can mathematics tell us things about evolution such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts \( or both \) this is a fun lighthearted book but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think i enjoy reading as i exercise on my elliptical machine i get double the sense of accomplishment when i can read and workout at the same time ordinarily i can estimate how long i ve been on the machine by how many pages i ve read 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average but with stewart s book i had to be careful several times i found that i d worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half a dozen pages or so if you love mathematics particularly mathematical puzzles then this is a book you ll really enjoy it has many problems for the reader with answers at the back of each chapter if you do the problems and understand everything in the book in detail it will occupy many hours of your time all in deep thought and utter enjoyment,positive

city of the dead can t really be called a zombie story it s really a cheesy action novel that just happens to have beings called zombies in it the zombie aren t really undead like in the romero movies but are corpses possessed by demons i really didn t find any part of the novel scary and it doesn t seem like the author was trying to make it scary he seemed to take the route so many hollywood scary flicks take and just tried to gross out his readers through descriptions of the decayed bodies of the demons the action is clunky and not very exciting his hero s are constantly stopping to argue about things like how jim s ex wife raised their son while being hotly pursued by hundreds of demons there are too many parts that require suspension of disbelief a military humvee could never catch an explorer suv the hero s escape a fire by climbing across a ladder to the neighbor s house with the demons somehow not noticing they re being chased by dozen s of demon vehicles on the road but second s later after crashing they have somehow lost them and i have to ask why keene included the descriptions of necrophilia in the novel in the end city of the dead reads more like a cheesy schwarzenegger stallone norris movie than a horror novel,negative
the essential histories series from osprey could easily be compared to the cliff notes series they ll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with but no real depth most volumns are under 100 pages therefore don t expect many man in the trenches stories this volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war and presented a bit better than most in the series,positive

i first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages the children were enthralled with the illustrations \( as were many adults \) but the message was deeply felt by the older child in all of us there it is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him and brought him pleasure he wished that he could influence others but never knew what his music did for the world maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for the message is true for children and adults alike i will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend and from the pulpit thank you david mcphail,positive

i m the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life i m still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet flushing my wife \( may she rest in peace \) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a wyoming nature preserve anyway life moves on much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything i should know how to do but fred you might be saying \( and i ll be saying fred isn t my name idiot \) how do you know what you should know if you don t know what it is to begin with ah well let me explain see if tchikavoslky taught me one thought it was this i know nothing so it is with this deep insight into my own mind that i came up with the following things i should know based on what i currently do not know 1 how to start a hurricane this is very important 2 how to kill a man with a toothpick what if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim scary 3 how to run a nuclear powerplant with a one man army i don t want to be the next homer simpson 4 how to raise children i ve raised ten and still haven t figured out what a diaper is 5 what a diaper is i don t know my wife used to talk about them a lot 6 how to drive sure technically we re supposed to learn how before we get our driver s licenses but like many people i just got a fake one when i was 12 and have been driving since then i ve been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter so i figured it might be good to learn how to drive 7 how to stalk a celebrity you just never know 8 how to put on underwear without leaving stain marks you fellas know what i m saying 9 how to make coffee people ask me to all the time and because i don t know how i just take some warm water and pour mud in thankfully no one s noticed my inadequacies yet but i m sure soon enough they will after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection 10 how to kill yourself i don t want the aliens to get anything out of me when i m taken hostage i saw it in that tom cruise movie and it was sure scary so with these things in mind i m severely disappointed by this book and feel it is mis marketed and stupid please barbet schroeder \( or whoever the author was \) write a better book next time,negative

oh dear this is another book like the horrible who moved my cheese that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children like the aforementioned who thinks my cheese stinks \( or whatever it is called \) i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days it s all about making work fun yep work can be fun tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases of course it s just great fun to deal with children who have just had their parents killed or folks who just lost their kids because that s what work is fun or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers of course in the examples i have listed above it doesn t really work too well because this is really about getting people in perceived lower end occupations like factories or call centres to believe their mind numbing daily tasks can be fun myself i do have some fun at work but probably like many people with more than one brain cell it is based on having a laugh with my co workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us you can call this cynicism which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb fish style work must be fun philosophy i d call it black humour but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable as to the title of my review this method of making the workplace fun in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise first immerse people in the cult like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as fun second let them know that they now choose their attitude if they are unhappy in any way \( regardless of them doing their work well or not \) they are letting the team down and not complying with the obligation to make work fun third while the majority of victims or workers however you choose to view your prey swallow the work is fun message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron style message that they just don t get it in this way the resistant individual can be said to be incompatible with our mission and values bad for morale or just out of step in this way the fun loving workers who have now taken on the costume of forced false fun can be set against them of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign this book is useful then if you wish to convince idiots that their work is fun just don t try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously they might tell you to stick your fish where the sun doesn t shine,negative

the author gives vague advice the calm down be objective cliche advice if you don t believe me i m literally quoting him although the author tries to make his book seem original as you can read it s not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned this is not something revolutionary this is rehash save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation you don t need to read hundreds of pages to do it or spend on what to imagine,negative
this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era that of border radio brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an x this spawned an industry of singers politicians preachers and pitchman the type we now see on infomercials mail was the barometer of the day the more mail you pulled in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations keep those cards and letters coming new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev ike get out of the ghetto and get into the get mo this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio salesmanship and american sub cultures and the bizarre,positive
as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises it s language is quaint and cozy to modern ears having first been written in 1856 but it is practical clear and encouraging it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw and by focussing on drawing with pencil it provides the foundation for using any other media a wonderful find,positive

while peter jay fernandez and jay o sanders aren t the only actors to narrate the acclaimed cross series they certainly are among the finest with a host of television appearances to his credit \( law order cosby \) massachusetts born hernandez has also made his mark on broadway in jelly s last jam and the merchant of venice his voice has a tad of huskiness which makes it all the more appealing as cross in all fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the alex cross tales so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene to date jay o sanders has narrated over 50 audio books and he s a perfect voice partner for fernandez his experience includes off broadway roles in shakespearean plays which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone the voices of fernandez and sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling cross stories to life it s a painful attention getter when we listen again to how cross lost his beloved wife maria she was shot down before his eyes her killer was never found the case chalked off as another sick drive by shooting now cross has returned to being a psychologist his children are thriving and perhaps he may be able to love someone again however a telephone call from john sampson his old partner changes all that sampson wants cross s help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in georgetown of course cross can t say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie in to maria s death some years ago one more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of james patterson read by two consummate voice performers gail cook,positive

consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan calvino s fiction is sui generis a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory oriented if on a winter s night a traveler this is the kind of novel borges might have written a celebration of the unbridled imagination invisible cities is also i am convinced a secret love letter to a single city the imaginary dream city of venice a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea,positive
this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy a year after this book was published there were over a hundred reviews regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author finds the author right or wrong interesting or boring this book is one of the most influential books if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy in fact the current bush adminstration s policies george kenan s containment henry kissinger s policies as well as countless adminstration s policies are shaped or affected by this book my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations differing on extent \( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after \) it is a fascinating book and hard to put down the author writes in a european style \( beautiful long sentences etc \) which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co students makes it more difficut to read he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically ms rice and mr kissinger were heavily influenced by this book to understand them this is a must read in and of itself it is an excellent book a classic and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists,positive

i first purchased this book when i was a freshman in college seven years ago it is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing i have ever read i love the plastic tabs that mark each section this guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section so for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape etc using the mla style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab i have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother a freshman in college i really wish i had this book when i was in high school i highly recommend this book to any high school college graduate student or writer i especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities i myself have add and before i got this guide i could not understand how to write a paper in the mla style or in any style other than a book report i promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published,positive
i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes but i have to admit i m disappointed with the recipes and with what i ve baked from it so far i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn t deliver the flavor punch of pure butter so i was a little skeptical and then reading through the recipes although they are very clearly written there aren t a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes the book already assumes a level of competence i made three recipes from the book the essential chewy sugar cookie the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie and the fudgy brownies all three recipes tasted delicious so i can t complain there but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes and both the cookies spread too much way too much and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results so right now i m wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up i think it s okay for a base cookie recipe book but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients,negative

i will start this review by noting two things i greatly appreciated nussbaum s upheavals of thought and i am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society i live in \( but then i recognise things in myself that for good or bad change my perspective from that of the society i am embedded in \) but wedekind s play springtime awakening should raise alarm bells for most of us we are sexual beings \( most of us anyway \) and we have to deal with that learn to accept it within ourselves learn to share it with others \( it is of course the quintessential sharing experience \) learn to grow with it learn to let it go the easy path to take is to grasp a social norm and follow it regardless of the morality of that path societies do present many norms to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable if nussbaum s book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable norms and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service there are curious things in this book for me nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male aristotle seneca js mill dh lawrence to be fair the last chapter is about to the lighthouse by virginia woolf and other writers such as andrea dworkin are prominent however i was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored where is mary wolstonecraft where is emma goldman where is mary shelley why is maurice \( forster \) referred to but not the well of loneliness \( hall \) the chapter on female genital mutilation \( fgm \) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted \( so i read \) to judaism while i would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk nevertheless i think the motivations for both practices come from the same source if for cultural \( religious \) reasons it is appropriate for jewish boys to be circumcised i think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate if not mandatory the chapter on equity and mercy impressed me immensely it is so balanced i expect many feminists will hate it but for me her rare use of a christian quote \( forgive them for they know not what they do \) was a revelation never before had i seen how compromised that plea is \( compare with tolstoy it is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself \) the fact that often i have other feelings than nussbaum expresses does not concern me because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts in the chapter on prostitution and its illegality i had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality the morality issues are complex perhaps irresolvably complex just as there are men with dangerous sexuality so there are women perhaps it s only an issue for men because they demand or expect control for me all of nussbaum s discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced the problem i see with prostitution is that it panders to the man s need to have sex they can get it on demand this reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives including the need \( wise or not \) for a woman to have a faithful partner in australia we had an advisor on women s affairs to the federal government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view based on her own practice that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting so he could satisfy his need when she herself felt incapable for me this is an appalling suggestion as if men cannot have self control and should not be expected to but for all of that like nussbaum i would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal for me this was a thought provoking read it had some incredibly ugly things to describe to consider but it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity other recommendations springtime awakening wedekind the well of loneliness radclyffe hall \( i hated the outcome of this \) matilda mary shelley \( her biographical details are worth exploring too \) godwin on wollstonecraft william godwin \( mary shelley s father mary wollstonecraft was her mother \) upheavals to thought nussbaum living my life emma goldman let me alone anna kavan conditions of love john armstrong,positive

this is hawking s attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math while still not an easy read it it much easier than the brief history of time that he wrote for laypeople before this a person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth,positive
i too read the ta for tots to my 3 5 year old 30 years ago she loved it a lot so i ve been looking for it again this time for my grand daughter even though the title is different from the original one i knew i purchased it and read it as soon as i received it bottomline this story is not the original one and i don t like it at all other than showing stereotypical happy prince and princess fairy tale characters \( which i can live with up to a point \) i saw bunches of red flags when i got to the evil witch drawn with a full blown ugly face who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan unhappy because there are so many happy warm fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies without enough warm fuzzies \( we read earlier \) it puts people in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die ouch so instead of embracing the wisdom of old women here we have another story that villifies them \( ok i m a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all \) no it s not funny and there is no way i would introduce this book to any child the book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are as the original book did too bad for using images of warm fuzzies and cold pricklies is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children i am returning the book,negative

this is the sort of book for paranoid people addicted to conspiracy theories they would rather believe a fanciful lie than the mundane truth though i don t agree with most of what s written in this book i don t regret buying it it teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and conspiracy theories if people believe that amalgams or metal restorations are the cause of their headaches fatigue or whatever symptoms then removing them will definitely cure them that s how faith healing works the only reason why i don t use amalgam in my practice is because i do cosmetic dentistry if the patient does not mind the colour amalgam is definitely a superior direct filling material for class 2 and subgingival preps i have absolutely no qualms about having that done for myself toxicity sure some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody but let s not forget that these cases are extremely rare \( perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be chinese \) there are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years there are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are if dr breiner has been to asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90 year old asian men and women who have gold and amalgam filled teeth in their mouths are composites totally safe the incidence of allergic reactions to composites \( very low \) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity this is something the author failed to inform us all his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam mercury can be very toxic but after tituration and amalgamation the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body it s different from inhaling mercury vapour daily injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds at the end of the day propagating such beliefs will only spark panic paranoia and various psychosomatic illnesses following breiner s protocols for detox patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise very simple dental work gosh with so many gullible patients in america i should probably move my practice to america and start doing amalgam detox instead of honing my skills for cutting crowns bridges and sinking implants,negative

what should have been a fascinating book at the very least as a voyeuristic experience fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages the text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author s failure at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling,negative
18 jun 2005 as the book progressed it got more and more egoistic to the point where it becomes a turn off towards the end of the book i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem shaq s attitude seems to be that since he can score he does not respect centers who can t score whereas he respect bill russell but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq so this is a big improvement,negative

love letters has a very simple concept two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage they never look at each other but within these letters is so much humor love and truth that the play will carry you away with delight i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i d heard so much about it after page three i didn t want to put it down now i m buying it for a friend don t think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance novel fodder if you have ever been in love you will recognize parts of yourself in this it always stays true to its well drawn characters which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful,positive
the book is not really on christ in the etheric but more several unrelated lectures about etheric life sometimes christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture the book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of cosmic life if you like the spiritual life that is connected with and influences life as seen only from with physical senses in the book is recorded about several ages \( golden age silver age iron age and dark age \) and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities or really spiritual consciousness diminished with each age and that the dark age has ended in 1899ac and that in this current age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a damascus experience \( experience of saul later paul in which he saw christ in etheric form \) people who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the earth consciousness sphere and could cause disturbances in the earth in this light rudolf steiner communicated about the brotherhoods in western and eastern countries and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet christ in the etheric \( 2nd coming of christ \( coming in the etheric \) and in future times coming of christ \( i e manifestation presence of christ in the astral \) \) in the book is also recorded about the sermon on the mount with the beautitudes \( recorded in matthew 5 \) where jesus communicated about the development of the soul \( as recorded in other books by rudolf steiner \( sentient soul intellectual soul etc \) \) in the book is also recorded about the afterlife if you like life of souls who have passed away and are still earthbound and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in earth in the book is communicated about different levels in the afterlife and how feelings and will are active it is recorded about astral plane lower devachan and higher devachan in etherization of the blood and later on again in three realms between death and rebirth where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the earth and how christ is also present there and can be experienced in earthly life as destiny and how people are so focused on what is or has happened but don t pay attention to what is result of it not happening \( e g getting delayed for an appointment or coming \( unexpectedly \) too early etc \) destiny is at work with christ having its workings present in it according to rudolf steiner in the book is also located about the double and how forces from within the earth influence it geo biology ireland was a place where those influences where most healthy for spiritual development cognition and ireland was the place where christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to europe by irish monks,positive
this book was on a very interseting topic the author took time in studying this topic it was about the impending world oil shortage that is the time when we the world will run out of oil it tells you about hubbert s analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from then they talk about where oil is they also talk about drilling for oil they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil sometimes it will take even more time then that then they talk about the size of oil fields they also reexamine hubbert s analysis later on in the book rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have hubbert was a brilliant man some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn t want to he told everybody the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about i wouldn t recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book,negative

this book is a small bundle of common knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and hucksterism \( and very bad english \) just how many times can you claim a technique will improve your workouts by a factor of ten or is the most valuable breakthrough in history before you lose all credibility in the first 30 pages winnowing out the fluff i read this 1 \) fad diets bulimia and steroids are bad for you 2 \) gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct processes so they require two classes of exercises 3 \) it s good to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are using during weight training routine 4 \) creative visualization and self hypnosis can help you reach your goals \( ok i m a bit skeptical about this one \) in other words this book has taught me nothing of value that i didn t already know looking ahead in the index i can see much more of the same i m afraid i ve been had i bought this book on the strength of amazon reader recommendations please don t make the same mistake look to gain muscle lift weights every other day and eat lots of protein to lose fat do cardio on off days and watch your total calories if you re already doing those things don t bother with this book i was looking for more specific tips but i didn t find them here and neither will you,negative

i just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought and i found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me i had no idea where to start when i stumbled across the philosophy gym nothing could have been more appropriate it dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint it introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bite sized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter i couldn t be more pleased with this intro to philosophy,positive

i d never read berry before but as far as i can tell this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory however it s probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm there are two related problems with the book one of presentation and one of tone the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there s no room for specifics so while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry s vision there s no detail to back it all up the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at of course some of the pieces are lectures but there s a certain condescension that runs throughout the book it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of appropriate authentic and adequate when these are used \( as they often are \) there he s obviously made some kind of value judgment but the reader is never let in on it the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir which is unfortunate since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things \( though not his anti abortion stance \) small farms are good agribusiness is bad stewardship of the land is good extraction industries are bad treating the body as an organic whole is good and things of that nature alas he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed and communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people country life and country places berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses for example in one essay he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine untouched state and that s all while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry s views on stewardship and land use it certainly doesn t help matters that his view of small scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose colored glasses his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition however it ignores the fact that historically small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins was subject to all kind of external instability \( weather vermin etc \) and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level in farming cash is scarce that s why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself such as in wwii when all those defense industry factories were opened in california \( of course in berry s vision you don t really need cash because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors \) berry s exhortations to create small scale communities is worthy stuff and even in cities people are creating this the growth of csas farmers markets and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this however to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection,negative
great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity though edited by bob blaisdell who presumably provides the single paragraph introductions the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day their messages speak for themselves a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections one is their brevity the speakers get to the point and make it clearly few inclusions run longer than five pages there is also a level of genuine \( and often sad \) honesty many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation if such a thing was possible at the time the tone is often one of resignation but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed rightly or wrongly the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts the style could almost be considered anti oratorical though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english nonetheless the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people separated by years language and geography who retain a clear headed means of addressing their listeners,positive
reading late james particularly the golden bowl often strikes me as being similar to reading a novel in a foreign language whose vocabulary you have mastered but whose grammar remains partially a mystery anyone who has attempted this will recognise the sensation of understanding all the words yet not understanding how they fit together you read a sentence two three or five times and it is only then that you understand if at all the meaning of all the words combined sometimes the meaning never becomes clear late james is a foreign language but one in which i have become more fluent over the years when i first read the golden bowl some years ago i understood very little and did not enjoy it the long convoluted sentences with so many things only half spoken and often never spoken at all seemed a vast and elaborate machine which never seemed to produce enough to justify its own existence yet now having read most of james over the intervening years i have become more fluent in his language and find the circumlocutions complexities and ellipses of the late style if not exactly crystal clear then certainly much clearer and even rather comforting and enjoyable the subtle discriminations the way james holds up to the light tenuous motives and turns them slowly very slowly so that their hidden facets become fleetingly visible the very real portrayal of interesting characters that james reveals as well as the languorous unpredictable turns of a jamesian sentence all offer the kinds of pleasures that no other writer \( possibly excepting proust \) is able to produce the golden bowl consists largely of conversations some continuing over many many pages the content of those conversations would for most writers comprise the details between the main actions of the plot and for most writers those conversations would occupy at most a few pages but for james it is the interstices between big events the dramas not so much of everyday events but of the subtle daily manipulations the unspoken victories and losses of personal relationships which interest him and which comprise the novel the subject of the golden bowl is the reciprocal marriages of father and daughter to a pair of former lovers the novel is about the tensions and deceptions and the manipulations that arise as a result who knows what about whom who is responsible for what actions who is deceiving whom and who has the moral authority as a consequence ultimately who if anyone triumphs and is their victory a hollow one these are the sorts of questions james is concerned with the golden bowl rates as a great novel one of the greatest of the twentieth century because of these qualities as well as its ambiguities it is also an enjoyable novel but to enjoy it you must first be sympathetic to the sorts of concerns james is interested in and you also need to be conversant in his distinctive language both of these require or at least i would recommend first reading james earlier and middle period works for most of us late james can be a struggle but one which is justified by its rewards i don t regard reading the golden bowl as an exercise only for academics pretentious aesthetes or literary masochists but i sympathise with those who do giving stars to a james novel seems a little inappropriate \( he is beyond these kinds of simplistic judgements \) but i have given the golden bowl four stars because there are times when it strains the patience even of those who admire the writing style and enjoy the late james novels and i prefer the ambassadors or the wings of the dove nevertheless the golden bowl is one of the great novels in english and is highly recommended to anyone who has read and enjoyed james other novels,positive

this book contains reproducible mini books bingo cards flash cards some word search puzzles and fill in activities in my opinion the fill ins are a bit too challenging i even had trouble with them the only thing in this book really worth it that i couldn t make as well myself are the mini books the mini books each contain several different sight words so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them,negative
this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time it could be categorised as belonging to the same genre of action fantasy as a number of hollywood films examples of the rules of reality being abandoned the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter and the author even notes at one point how it s pitch dark outside yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other people spend minutes in freezing water yet pop out none the worse for the wear two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a spaceship has been found there shouted once through the radio a 12 year old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically nor apparently mentally a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it the stupidity goes on and on but that s perhaps enough to give a taste there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this but i don t enjoy books whose author doesn t have one bit of interest in any sort of realism,negative

i got this as both a book and an audio file i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts \( e g i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell what bible passage evidences this \) i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations where were his editors when this was being written why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those conservatives frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on i did appreciate his story about daniel and the delayed angel but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well the bible well so far i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself i wonder if i can get a refund,negative
i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget i was wrong instead it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands on all kinds of architectural extravagances perhaps this book could have a subtitle how to spend a million dollars on a 1 500 square foot house if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply this is the wrong book,negative
the subject provided a good historical perspective on japan s renaissance period post civil wars and pre westernization in many respects musashi a ronin represents japan s search for an identity a country ruled by military might in the form of the shogun yet keeping an emperor who they revered as a god a god without power this sword saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel he was also an artist a lithographer and an author yet he was masterless masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer s devotion to his master he was his own master in a time when japan had no voice serving all without righteous it would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the samurai that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of miyamoto musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession master of the sword,positive
i do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment but i simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it this is called censorship and it gives me the creeps as a parent i have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children so to realise that somebody has been cheating on me trying to do my job so that i did not have to explain how society has evolved how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud this review is about the harper collins edition edited by patricia c and frederick l mckissak illustrated by michael hague,negative

what is remarkable about this onetime best selling book which could well be described as a coming of age without coming of age novel is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24 nope the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced the great gatsby a mere five years later this side of paradise is a mess it is as uneven affected feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero the tiresomely self conscious young minnesotan gone to princeton amory blaine \( one suspects in fact that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory s diary the result would have been considerably more readable or the book s structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable at least \) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 it was to prove the most popular book in terms of sales ever produced by its author presumably speaks to the public s recognition of something new and revealing in it okay amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype and the drinking and shameless smooching \( etc \) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably one can accept a revelation to see in print \( and likely a titillating one \) for an american audience raised on mcguffy s readers and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war welp here it comes on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon the petting party none of the victorian mothers and most of the mothers were victorian had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed to the reader at a remove of some 80 plus years this is of course very small beer what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now in the best cases of the paradise narrative as unalarming quaintness while this is not exactly fitzgerald s fault so to speak it is also true that the use of shocking revelations of this type scandals specific to a place and time represents a risk a writer takes the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and or universal in such episodes in any event the price the reader pays here in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory s adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties is very very high for payoffs of such modest proportions i mean come on for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it eleanor was say the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes yikes i don t care what new generation you re talking about can a flake pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody \( can it represent anything to anybody \) there are things to like even admire here and there in paradise fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark \( e g they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered sometimes i wish i d been an englishman american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy it s better to leave the blustering and tremulo heroism to the middle classes they do it so much better \) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator s observations is in its now curious way refreshingly bracingly funny slowly and inevitably yet with a sudden surge at the last while amory talked and dreamed which is about all amory ever does mht war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings when amory went to washington the next weekend he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens greeks he guessed or russians nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there s a war on i always say anyway most of the novel consists of young amory s elaborate ponderings romantic philosophical and egotistical which are as forgivable as they are forgettable i ve forgotten them already at some level in any case fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character who was of course a not very disguised version of himself for how else if not as commendably self deprecating irony are we to take this observation amory was in full stride confident nervous and jubilant scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty six hours in the end in any event one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder in paradise almost nothing works form content narrative stance dialogue character development pacing you name it it s a problem yet in gatsby five years later everything works everything if there is to be a great american novel it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b the fact is that he did and without point a the journey could not have begun so while this side of paradise hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon it surely deserves our respect and indeed our gratitude for what it led to,negative

richard fortney s earth is a survey in mostly layman s terms of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth selecting a series of locations where the earth s geology is apparent and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy preceeds to the hawaiian islands hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the supercontinent of gondwana for each location fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location along the way fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences it turns out for example that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates \( north america ocean bottom and northern europe \) the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney s historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages and fortney s explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader nevertheless this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history,positive

as a librarian and a lover of all things relating to arts crafts style i recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture s history and design evolution with clear color photographs and just the right amount of text this book illustrates the origins of arts crafts furniture in england and its progression first to our east coast and eventually westward across america in fact my only complaint about this book is that the photographs are good enough that they leave you wanting for more because of the depth of information presented here i would not say that this is a general interest read rather this book is geared toward those seriously interested in the history of the arts crafts movement and its recent revival,positive
i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything \( that would have been impossible anyway \) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader \( civil rights \) and unsuccessful leader \( vietnam \) his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on line book study at the work and worship institute website i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society,positive
gibbon s decline and fall is without a doubt one of the most well written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the roman empire from the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the imperial court gibbon showcases the history of rome as it unfolded often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time there are a few minute problems or rather gaps in gibbon s work but given that he originally published in the late 1700 s we can excuse his lack of complete information overall an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject,positive

very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5 8 of the story i add 1 8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained but too often this reference becomes a one sided sermon for free trade these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton repubs kept the song going without missing a beat most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies the rich get richer in both parties feel free to read to learn about terms just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path,negative

i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction apparently oprah s as well,negative
for the most part the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book s printing but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms be warned there are several places where the book goes awry for example the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal occasionally hunting in pairs problem no tracks of a t rex have been discovered to date a decade and a half after the writing aside from that and a few other points though the book is good reading,negative

i picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of dr king apart from the obligatory images we re force fed each new year instead i was disappointed to find that eric dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten one such example includes dyson conveying the idea that dr king may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right hand man ralph abernathy he then goes on to infer that there was talk of king and abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other the author had no commentary to either support or dispel this theory making dyson s retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous he just dropped the information true or untrue in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased to that end it is my opinion that dyson s intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth seeking rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen i m reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me an empty wagon makes the loudest noise eric dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance this was an expensive tabloid,negative
i didn t expect to like this book after reading the first 30 of 196 pages the graphic detail used to describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies made me wonder where in the heck this story could go and more importantly why would i want to read it where does the story go it s a wandering timetable we know the two main characters joseph and celice both professors of zoology married for 30 years are dead and the forward movement not only includes their ongoing decay but also their eventual discovery by police dogs and the introduction of their grown daughter syl as she copes with her knowledge of their death it also goes back to when they first met as students sharing a study house at the shore they are an unlikely pair and yet they come together through mutual attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience and live at least according to their estranged daughter an unremarkable life the timetable further allows the reader to relive the last day of their lives hour by hour from the murder back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day together at the very shore where they d met some 30 years earlier the layout of the story was brilliant and not in the least bit confusing the language \( british english \) is both lofty and gritty probably not unlike joseph and celice some of the thoughtful insights about life and death are very very poignant for example when syl contemplates the loss of her parents her gene supplies had closed shop their daughter was the next in line she could not duck out of the queue so she should not waste her time in this black universe the world s small breathing denizens its quaking congregations and its stargazers were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in hopes of paradise or fears of hell no one transcends there is no future and no past there is no remedy for death or birth except to hug the spaces in between live loud live wide live tall i thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating both the fact that life always goes marching on and the importance of our obligation to the dead \( and dying \) that we live life well the title and thesis of the book are one and the same being dead highly recommend from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group,positive

other reviewers have taken pains to outline the plot of this baby boomer bodice ripper suffice it to say author kathryn harrison scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that more is better offers estrangement between identical twins loss of a child incest paternity confusion mid life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink this reader was aching for the hero will to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like it s just it s what is it will doesn t have a word for what he feels \( perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader the author however should not in any case those are lousy lazy sentences among so many examples \) in addition to being insufferably cartoonishly silly the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure bad things happen to will the shrink will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened what he thinks happened and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks as for ms harrsion s famous sex scenes they practically lie on their backs fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval she s unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly almost unnaturally slippery envy by the way is ms harrison s 11th book and she should by now be getting things more right than wrong,negative

going to barsetshire is a delightful book and a much needed accompaniment to the thirkell novels ms snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29 novels in thirkell s barsetshire series and has produced a companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of the characters places and cultural references especially for an american who is not well versed in mid 20th century english esoterica i also enjoyed the writing style and the well chosen quotes in addition to the book s comprehensive content is its straightforward layout and user friendly format this exemplary reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production but instead keeps with the simple charm of barsetshire in its quality and overall appearance the original cover art showing an idyllic barsetshire scene is lovely i heartily recomend the book to all thirkell fans,positive

lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist ready if needs be to question cherished assumptions one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory where he initially states as he sees it the five big problems in physics in this context he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970 s there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and in particular he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics but then he builds up his case against the theory he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model probably the most successful theory in physics but even predicts particles not seen in nature it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed but notes that this theory m theory still remains a tantalizing conjecture he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says we are missing something big there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the murk into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature the clues are there to do this lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not and whether it is lateral thinking or a breakthrough revolution in conceptual thinking new thinking is definitely required lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation a good choice perhaps i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book if they have not already done so,positive
this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook \( certainly by european standards \) but the physical packaging is a total disaster it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins it is difficult to read text near the spine and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page the most unuseable book i ve ever experienced,negative
having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie antoinette but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual she depicts marie antoinette s mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married but arranged marriages were the norm the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen of which there is little concrete evidence but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant it seems to me that marie antoinette loved children so much she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france if marie antoinette had been caught in adultery it would have been considered treason she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her with all of her enemies at court that was not a risk she would have taken if she had been so inclined on a smaller scale fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie antoinette dyeing her hair in all the pictures that i have seen of her her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it not that that is a big deal but it makes me wonder where lady fraser s life ends and where marie antoinette s life begins i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie antoinette s death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king especially since marie antoinette s murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor sadly there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language one can only hope that the works of bertieres chalon and delorme will soon be translated and published in english fraser s book does have some interesting details \( aside from those which flow from her imagination \) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever s travesty,negative
i admittedly have not completed the full book as it is thick however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss for example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn t seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss barry,negative

i was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment one would think that a scholar such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the hebraic roots of judeo christianity it was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known messianic signs spoken of in the gospels he is also clueless to the pharisidical judaism of the time not comprehending that all of christ s teachings were completely in keeping with true judaism all of which can be found in contemporary rabbinical teachings of his time this book which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels like it or not the new testament writings are hebraic and explain what fulfilled judaism is those who need to divorce judaism from christianity are offering a church which is already confused just more confusion it is through studying the hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the difficult sayings of our lord fullfillment of the law binding and loosing \( the law \) etc as well as the parables the delivering of the deaf mute was a messianic sign because the rabbi s knew that they had to ask the said demon its name but he did not lazerus s resurrection was a messianic sign because the rabbi s believed that anyone could come back to life during the first three days after death cleansing of a leper was messainic sign because the rabbi s understood that it was a divine punishment that only god could lift how else can we link isa 53 with the stripes he was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the law required for transgression and yet minus one had our lord transgressed the law then the jews themselves could have legally killed him remember paul \( saul \) he also does not understand john and his huge part in the whole picture in that the kingdom began with john he was the breachmaker as fortold in prophecy this is hebraic roots 101 people please study the hebraic roots of christianity and do not waste your time with this book the fact that he keeps defending his position as not anti semetic should give you a clue,negative

being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a hard industry i personally believe that it s in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that s the foundation of real wealth not legal services or newswires so this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is and suggest ways to improve it oh how very very wrong i was this book started off strong for about four pages after that a litany of tortured logic un sourced assertions facts taken completely out of context except for the author s subjectively added adjectives orwellian double speak sleight of hand arguments flat out ridiculuos statements contradictory assessments and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left george soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century even a broken watch is correct twice a day though so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating these include manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs provided it s run right \( a big if \) high wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates there is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain \( i e enron \) a scholarly fair and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful this is not what you ll get in this book though instead you ll get a begining section about postindustrialism things like the internet information technology financial services etc the things that make the services based economy in three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men set them on fire and piss on the smoldering remains this is where vitriol even comes out where he equates the post industrialists to people incapable of even thinking if someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument they probably don t have one most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist to me this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to oh i don t know let s say a fish a middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing this is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there s no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large this is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data charts of gdp growth over time pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services manufacture agriculture etc you will get none of that there s little value except in reassuring the obvious high wage nations can do manufacturing many of these cherry picked anectdotal examples still don t quite dove tail with all his claims about manufacturing though you also know you re being left in the dark with a plethora of cya disclaimer statments like while industry x has certainly had its share of problems recently at the begining of a section a final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez faire free markets and the concept of free trade george soros and a bunch of other lefties with pat buchanan thrown in for balance should be listened to instead the worst part of this book is the author s lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument examples of twisted thinking abound a post industrial industry grows five times over in a certain period the author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60 self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise the author s challenge to the reader seems to be who are you going to believe me or your lying eyes he rips into american post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world later he talks about how great german manufacturing is because germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world s workers the only facts he presents and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context when describing service industries paltry 50 million revenues only 60 000 jobs disappointing 24 of revenues from foreign sources is common but when describing manufacturing a very high 6 million revenues a good mix of 1 500 jobs and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow a number in and of itself means nothing the fact the author leaves out any head on direct comparison between industries is telling official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes when the official figures don t agree with him he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong when attacking his straw men though he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner gems of orwellian double speak sentences include examples like solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity \( pg 184 \) i e it s competitive where there is no competition and even in singapore one of the freest societies in the east the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings \( pg 229 \) that s not very free if it s forced is it \( his defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages i ve ever read and really is worth the price of the book he capstones it with the most encouraging observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out wow what an achievement any actual power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it s internal workings wear out but whatever \) americans are dumb and the only successful american companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards the american economy despite the statistics is in bad shape the japanese instead are eight feet tall can read people s minds and see through lead the japanese economy despite the statistics is in really great shape this type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments the author basically can t get out of his own way he always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don t put numbers into context are using twisted logic making mere assertions instead of quoting facts etc apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses he claims boeing is no longer a good company because 30 of components in a boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs 2 in the 1960 s this is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper america isn t doing that badly in aerospace by the way the author fails to mention that 50 of the european airbus is made in america this is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient the list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions you d have to buy the book to see them all because there s at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page all in all this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity it s really a mercantilist argument and the only common thread that i could see in all the author s cloudy reasoning is that nation s should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what it s not unfortunately a book about how to revitalize american manufacturing in a globalized world,negative

i can not put into words what this journal of the truth has done for me as a african american male living in the united states of america i was introduced to this book by a man of guyanese decent who knew i needed to read this book i have to admit it was a difficult read because my primary education only spoke of american history and there was no mentioning of any african caribbean contributors from the middle passage period now at thirty nine many things are clearer to me roots and beloved are historic well documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race creed or color to make sure what i read had some semblance of truth while in puerto rico i visited a sugar mill in guanica and my heart just melted if you read the book you will understand my feelings i became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of american children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from africa south america the caribbean asia united states and europe eric williams i know i can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken thank you for everyone else read the book it will cleanse your soul and feed your mind once you finish this read how europe underdeveloped africa by the same author,positive

this is an excellent book its academic sociological approach may put off some lay readers but that would be too bad the subject and the message are both very important in many ways this book is similar to the appearance of impropriety how the ethics wars have undermined american government business and society but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social science standpoint an excellent book well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed \( at best \) results,positive
this book is the equivalent of the proustian madeleine to read it is to recover a past long lost making the case for the mordant paradigm shift of us morals ethics and literary tastes this is the marker past which one can see the sad decline of the quality of art and life in the modern world i cannot improve on the highly intelligent and sensitive overview given here by reviewer big orange paxbear and so will not review the book in detail that it is one of only three saroyan volumes still in print makes the case for the obsolesence of the clear heart and clear mind in today s mindlessly kinetic world you can read this book in the time it would take you to go see mi 111 in a cineplex carpe diem read this instead,positive

i read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me that s why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again oh boy am i glad i bought it since last time i read it i have read many romance novels many great one and many bad ones too i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong this book still made my heart race made me smile at joe s attempts to make ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them joe s character was just amazing and most endearing was his insecurities here was a navy seal one of the toughest possible guys and he was insecure about his upbringing and background he felt veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him he was sooooo sweet he was so cocky stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from veronica just goes to show how a person s outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them i can t find any more book of this series i am still searching for them i know i have to read all of them,positive

i was also disappointed with evanovich s latest book if i read this book not knowing who the author was i would have guessed it was written by her it s amazing how many of the character s actions and spoken words are strikingly similar to the plum series agree that the pugg character is really annoying i am a huge evanovich fan and have read most of her non plum books but would have to say this is my least favorite looking forward to the 13th plum in june,negative
if you want to believe an illusion go for it some readers say he is well informed whoa this guy talks about science without any credentials to do so if it makes you feel good to believe that the us is bad the environment is collapsing and we need socialism to survive then this is the book for you if you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion find another source waste of money,negative
the author had a great idea but he cherry picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense for example superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2 two jewish guys right at the end of ww2 write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b c it s destroyed etc etc i m not critiscizing this book b c it has a religious message i m critiscizing it b c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement otherwise i disagree with anybody that says it is just a comic superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america,negative
it s a long read the characters are boring and the ending makes no sense at all it is neither funny nor thrilling it s just plain dull,negative
this book ranks along side will durant s story of philosophy as the best book on western philosophy the key difference is that whereas durant deals only with some selected individuals russell gives a comprehensive history topics that get the short shrift in most histories \( pre socratics medieval philosophy etc \) are given the full treatment here howp has an authority that few can match russell was a great philosopher himself no history of western philosophy is complete without a chapter on him the book is strewn with gems of wisdom 1 the union of idealism and love of power has led men astray throughout history and continues to do so even today \( on sparta \) 2 religions that condemn the pleasures of the senses drive men towards the pleasures of power throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic \( on the clergy in the middle ages \) 3 contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people s happiness and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race \( on continental idealists \) at times the book does get a little dense there is only so far russell is willing to go to make the subject accessible to the lay reader i would especially recommend this book for history buffs russell dovetails the development of western philosophy beautifully with european history there is no better way to develop interest in a subject than to read a book that connects it with a subject you are already passionate about,positive
the humor is definitely not in the book reviews and summaries use the word hilarity however i did not come across any situation that i would classify as even funny not to mention hilarious i thoroughly enjoyed her first novel pink slip however this one seemed depressing the two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story the plot seemed to be very slow the whole story took place in a matter of days but really nothing took place in the book all in all they bought a house i would pass on this for better reads elsewhere,negative
i didn t have especailly high hopes for this book i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years and this one brings it to a new low basically it s waaaaaay too long at 850 pages it s a monster read and a slow one that s not always a bad thing sometimes if you like the characters it s nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page but not here why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language for several paragraphs more than once why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services i think i d be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book though i can t quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it s been out of use here for decades maybe it was easy to cut and paste and got the word count up and then there s the space combat a strength of the series especially the first three or four but there s the rub there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up by the 11th book in the series i can t be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences but the big problem spoiler alert is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with honor loves hamish emily loves hamish hamish loves honor and emily what to do it turns out that there s an easy solution after about 400 pages of agonising \( not to mention most of the previous book \) it seems that honor can marry them both a bit outre seemingly not apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom \( although we ve never had a whiff of this before \) but what really gets me is that the reason it didn t happen about halfway through the last book is that \( get this \) gosh no one thought of it it seems that no one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i all in all i can only say please mr weber it is time to bring the series to an end please do it soon,negative
i m very disappointed in this book although some information in it is valuable it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need although broken into sections they are not readily found or visible one must search the information needed as in a research assignment the reproducibles are mainly for elementary grades this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it s contents on line although the price was reasonable i m not pleased with the way the book is organized printed,negative
i was referred to this book by my midwife \( debra o conner \) as a book that i had to read as it s content was so right on and was she ever right i know alot about my body i am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a 3 year old that i had at home i spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process that was great knowledge to add to the physiology i learned during my massage training this book though is something that every woman in our culture today should read i now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken i hope to give this to everyone i know who has a daughter i hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message it is women s reality and needs to be shared of course it is written by a midwife thank you elizabeth,positive
do you like romance novels do you call your dogs your babies this is the book for you the thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge this was my first johansen novel and it most certainly will be my last two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends,negative
surely i m not the only one who found this book totally bad the only thing it made me wonder about is how it s possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women the writing is just dull and full of the author s biases and prejudices which just aren t nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves it s written in that old school feminism \( negative no fun \) tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond my advice find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder s lens,negative
i forced myself to finish this book though it was touch and go in several places just so i could feel able to review it fairly it seems i liked it even less than reviewer ms trieste cf below but i am in general agreement with her points there are just so many things wrong with this book that even the grating famous names don t really stand out for me let s see where to begin the naive political ranting the unspeakable dialogue the corny love interest the wholly implausible technology the absurd coincidences the distractingly disjointed structure the proliferation of minor characters the talky explanations of the detective s thought processes the total incompetence and corruption of the police i can t go on it s hackneyed and poorly written and that s all there is to it,negative
the text is ok and the way the story is cut up in frames and assembled is competent but the drawings are the work of a hack often tacky and always styleless and garishly colored the costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight the attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book an affront to connoisseurs of either opera or comics or both only valuable as a kitschy curiosity,negative
if you re in the bathroom with time on your hands i must admit that i did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over puzo \( like leon uris \) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception in just a few hundred pages president kennedy ii is shown as a tyrant a socialist a reactionary a humanitarian a political bumbler a visionary of usa utopia a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector a dear and loving husband father etc how many characters must one man be and what s this odd sub plot of a former mormon hollywood oddball who on a whim \( in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself \) decides to kill the president of the united states once again another character with fourteen different personalities puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the mormons \( he should have stuck with the catholic church \) i would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me i would go crazy reading it again,negative

clinton s old friend and key russia advisor provides insight on a number foreign policy topics as they evolve as deputy secretary of state his accounts provide personal scholarly and practical accounts the reader might determine both that talbott was an invaluable resource as the post cold war era evolved and that in the end clinton was his own russia hand the primary theme of the book is the relationship between clinton and russian president boris yeltsin as they address issues such as nato expansion the balkans economic difficulties and each president s own personal troubles a number of lessons emerge first great power politics takes place between human beings not merely among structural or organizational frameworks second the blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex they are not either or options third political military economic domestic and international issues all impact each other often in surprising ways fourth watch out for the u in trying to explain policy making in the generic y ax by cz u that u \( for unexplained unexpected \) can often play a large role the russia hand is valuable to students of foreign policy russia and u s russia relations and the emergence of the post cold war era,positive
although i have only read a few specific subjects in this book i am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life threatening disease for anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum \( hg \) reading that a spa day would be beneficial is not only absurd but also insulting many women with hg cannot get to another room of the house without help much less drive a car to a spa hg is a disease and not a psychological condition women cannot stop the disease at will this myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children some women have life long effects \(,negative
i have reviewed all 31 chapters of psycho babble in the book \( and the epilogue too \) a very nice read indeed entertaining and yes funny in many ways they also use doubtfull suggestions like bringing doughnuts because people like them they also demystify some myths about teamwork \( i do not know where they got those myths from \) another fragment of their imagination i suppose this business book is more of a romantic novel about something relating to teams full of anecdotal references \( very life like \) but totally unsubstantiated wanting us to believe that indeed teams things are like they describe it from an entertaining point of view very from an academic point of view null for a business person if you have time to waist have fun it is interesting to note that they got a uk award for their book \( for entertaining i suppose \) i guess this is a way of promoting the book good marketing technique,negative
someone gave me this book as a gift why i have no idea this book is about as intelligent as a tv sitcom about as funny as a tv sitcom and generally at the level of a tv sitcom i found it neither funny inspiring nor interesting it is in the final analysis proof that any book that purports to be about strong or outrageous women will immediately sell thousands of copies regardless of the piffle between the covers and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything probably best for teenaged girls who don t read much it s no worse than tv i guess,negative

i am not going to go over the contents of the book or much about charles bukowski because if you are considering this book you must know something about the man and his work i will just give you my impression of this collection of work no collection can ever really be complete there are always new things to add new commentary newly discovered works transcripts of records and unpublished letters but this book does an excellent job in its attempt to me charles bukowski will always be one of the greatest american writers of the twentieth century because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates it is funny sad sadistic cruel scathing enlightening and thought provoking everything i like to read this is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers trees and greek mythology this is raw human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper it is not perfect and it is not trying to be it doesn t always work but there in lies the subtle beauty of bukowski s efforts the guts to try the attempts at honesty clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything and his cynicism of man this book has one of the most moving amazing and insightful poems or anything else ever written it is called the genius of the crowd if you read that work of art and are not moved nothing will this collection is shocking in its beauty and inspiring by its simplicity enjoy,positive

this book has a lot of insights about various ways in which the pace of life and learning have since the scientific revolution accelerated in other words it is a book which gives one much to think about the problem is that it also suggests that given the vast increase of information available to us the vast increase in possible alternatives for our attention that we will probably have our minds moved away from the insights so rapidly as to not even absorb them the obvious reply to such an intense barrage upon our consciousness is to withdraw and when we withdraw and close out all that is accelerating around us we begin to try and make a pace and story of our own within ourselves the faster we are forced to go the slower we may need to go i think a companion volume or perhaps a contradictory volume should be written on all those human activities which might be aided by our going slower in them and along with this volume should be advice and recommendation of how to keep out of our life these seemingly endless intrusions which disrupt our living by our own rhythm run slowly slowly horses of the night,positive

true there are many controversies raging about copying dvds and copyrights i suspect we are in a transition zone with all this and the industry will figure out how to help people love and cherish their dvds rather than simply calling everyone a pirate having said that i can also understand why an author of such a book wouldn t want to say too much about this controversy especially if he his looking over his shoulder at the lawyers i was trying to think of an analogy to express my disapointment in this book \( and this isn t a good one \) but it goes like this you want to go to israel and you buy a book on israel for dummies and you search for something anything on the controversy of the wall they are building but instead of finding a discussion of the controversy you find a few off handed quips about there s a wall going up and it s causing some controversy nuff said nuff said hel lo were dummies out here that s why we bought the dumb book there might be some useful information for some people but i was sorely disappointed,negative

this book is offensive to at least one of the two genders though it s hard to say which it suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot more or less whether that s more insulting to the male brain or the female body i m not sure but the book portrays neither gender realistically i like heinlein and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass and it s not even particularly good at being that the gender swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so but heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo enlightened erotica instead of literature more s the pity,negative
having recently graduated with a ba in english i am forever doomed to read such so called truth texts with what could only be called an eye for detail does the author site her sources credentials any sort of solid evidence as to why i as her reader should believe a word of what she says the answer is simply no ms cumbey quotes other texts by other zealotous fundamentalists to be sure however the credentials of these people remain a mystery anyone can write a book and anyone with enough money can get it published had i the funds i could write a revealing riveting best seller on the nature of human genomes and cloning and my opinions of the matter throw in a few quotes by people who may or may not sound like they know what they re talking about and there you go the point is my knowledge of such topics is sorely limited as is ms cumbey s research yet somehow a book that would never earn a passing grade in a collegiate literature course for lack of research and depth of understanding is littering our shelves well i m baffled,negative

firstly i have not seen the film adaptation of single white female and so this review isn t tainted one way or the other this book about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate is written is very easy style characterizations prose and dialogue are all straightforward i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel and the book s feel is anything but original sliver by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life \( and danger \) in manhattan for a single white female still single white female is an entertaining read bottom line a very enjoyable suspenseful read that doesn t tax the brain recommended,positive
arrogance by bernard goldberg is a truly enjoyable read goldberg doesn t waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to islam or communism he just presents the facts as he sees them as a former insider he s got the dirt on media bigwigs and he s not afraid to dish the liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions \( some tongue in cheek \) for correcting this slant he also includes surprisingly frank interviews with tim russert and bob costas goldberg s other books bias and 100 people who are screwing up america are also excellent reads he doesn t attack people on a personal level \( although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against dan rather \) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country but goldberg s books don t have that effect you can tell he not only loves the country he lives in but also the profession that he s chosen and he has hope for the future,positive

noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his yours and mine the united states of america he has made millions of dollars teaching lecturing selling his books and investing his world wide fame in psycholinguistics is well deserved his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u s in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism when he always ranks the u s and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now and even in history his distrust of any authority benign or otherwise is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the underdog even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah yet since 1955 hypocrite chomsky has worked for the overdog massachusetts institute of technology which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction and continues to this very day chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money earning the adulation of the american left and freedom to express himself he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea iran or syria let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much the united states of america god bless america which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak teach and make lots of money raybo,negative
i have yet to read this book however so far the average rating is quite suspicious each one of the three reviewers does not have a single other review in their profile i am at the stage where i am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads trading so i would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book to do everyone of the rest of us a favor and post an honest review please we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w the author or his publisher,negative
i started with the second volume the mammoth book of more historical whodunnits and enjoyed it so much that i went out and got a copy of this one as well i really liked the time span of story settings and the best part was the mystery that was written down over 2000 years ago great for people who like short story mysteries and as a lead in to authors you might like,positive

i read an interview with mr vollman i think a couple years ago i can t quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people they save marriages they provide comfort to the loneliest most desperate among us in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman s writing on the surface whores for gloria is one desperate delusional man so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes it isn t fully clear if gloria herself was ever real but regardless it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples such as hair clippings as well as emotional artifacts the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories the prostitute complies as best she can but story after story the narratives veer into disturbing material the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time the more intelligent and observant one is the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius such as a thelonius monk solo or in this case vollman s writing i ve never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness and no better forum than gutter sex which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling and he doesn t do it by being overly clever he does it through the chaos of brute honesty whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing the end product is very readable and deceptively simple,positive
native tongue by carl hiaasen this book is fast paced has a lot of energy and a zany weirdness no doubt it is a page turner and it is better than the other book of hiaasen s i have read double whammy but all that does not a good read make a strength of hiaasen s books are his characters well defined and numerous most are straightforward stereotypes from the out of luck journalist turned publicist the vapid sex phone girlfriend a steroid doped strongman the crude and sleazy millionaire bad guy a muscular but clear minded black good guy cop to the dumb but intrinsically good guy burglars and loads of redneck florida crackers hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops and by casting two characters that are quite original an environmentally militant 70 aged woman and an environmentally crazed former governor gone wildman and we meet psychotic whales and sex starved dolphins etc etc so what s wrong mainly it s that the book stays at a level of tv sitcom gone book it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject one might think that the exception is the environment but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment if you like brainless action gratuitous violence gross humor and zany fun native tongue might satisfy i have one additional problem with hiassen and it s similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton these books stink of hypocrisy crichton makes a \( seriously good \) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science hiassen s heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society but hiaasen s writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent,negative
i know a lot of people liked this book but i felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds i didn t realise so much of the book was focused on diet it says you should plan on gaining a pound a week and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be well the first 13 weeks i managed to gain nothing and i felt horrible about it but food made me so sick the last thing i could do was eat more food to try to gain weight the book said that according to my starting weight i should try to gain 50 60 pounds during my pregnancy i decided to stop reading the book and so far just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when i ve managed to put on 20 pounds my twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy this book isn t horrible but i would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used don t spend the on a new one and be prepared to put it down if it doesn t sound right to you,negative

more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn t make that connection having read a few of faulkner s works sturgeon uses many of faulkner s narrative trademarks \( i e streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative \) but i didn t feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others so the idea might of been original in the 50 s but topics like telekenesis esp computer brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before \( asimov \) and since this book rarely set off that wow button in my head or kept me turning pages this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book \( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 \) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting \( in this example \) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can t really be ignored besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood s end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci fi needless to say more than human did not win \( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so \) bottom line i wanted to like this book and it doesn t surprise me that others give it such high praise these are probably people that don t read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests,negative
i am a huge thomas hardy fan and i was not disappointed with this book at first all the technical astronomical information was slow but the love story started and that was forgotten my only complaint about two on a tower is the ending it seems very rushed everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages it wasn t realistic for viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later considering she was only 33 at the end of the story sir constantine was possessive jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him the bishop was full of himself how is that worse a few years with him and all of a sudden she s an old woman with a heart condition swithin comes back and says he ll marry her she s overcome with joy and boom she dies in his arms i also find it strange that neither swithin or viviette acknowledged that the boy was his didn t people in the village realize who he looked like since people were already suspicious of the lovers what will happen next swithin takes his son in and marries tabitha lark a very good sad complicated romance,positive

this book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules which is of course of fundamental importance to the chemist bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book this is a book that i often use as a reference this book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas it is not a particularly advanced book but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when i need it,positive
i read this book with an open mind i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status in a few cases i think this criticism may be legitimate in other cases not so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community \( note i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction \) i didn t find anything in this book to convince me of that what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports \( audits etc \) to which the author refers but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to play the victim card and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author s allegations to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage and to the extent that this book detracts from this i think it is unfortunate,negative

every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading and look for a surprise or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out it is with this mindset i picked up wouldn t take nothing for my journey now and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration ehh ms angelou may not take anything for her journey but based on the cover price she will take 17 00 to tell you a bit about it and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided whatever the cause this book is dreadful if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble gook i e about boundaries respect finding ones direction learning what it means to be a women etc then this journey is for you but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere,negative

i dont take neither stance on religion nor science with these comments i have read the book and i have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly it has one goal sell sell sell if you are after useful quality informative knowledge to gain well you wont find it here im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says non fiction the author is a talented story teller add a few statistics here and there a dash of scientific key figures mix it with life s controversial unsolved mysteries a few more dash of historic events and famous people add and link a few references here and there and wala you have a best seller isnt that ironic it is a new york times number 1 best seller it was an interesting read though,negative
when i was in the sixth grade we moved twice and in all three of the schools from new jersey to connecticut to japan i got to study ancient greece in the history part of the class i also got a lot of mileage out of having read edith hamilton s mythology \( i still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations \) but in all the times i got to study ancient greece before during and after the sixth grade i never got to do any of the fun stuff that avery hart paul mantell come up with for ancient greece 40 hands on activities to experience this wondrous age this kaleidoscope kids volume for kids ages 7 12 not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the ancient greeks so this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands on experiences it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used throughout the book there are great greeks and things to think about after reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from ancient greece hart and mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when then the book looks at key periods of greek history meet the minoans the pre greeks of crete looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of greece with activities to make a greek yo yo a great mother figure a hamster labyrinth \( without the minotaur \) and a fantastic fresco that gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to greece itself other chapters are devoted to the age of heroes where you get a super short version of the iliad and can build a trojan horse language unites \( including speaking pig greek \) the dawn of a golden age where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath and ye gods greek religion and mythology where you can design your own constellation in the last part of the book chapters cover classical athens the flower of ancient civilization where you get to build a greek temple with ionic columns \( or even build the entire parthenon \) think for yourself philosophy where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium and the amazing arts which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a greek play in the second part the final chapter covers a wider world alexander the great and the hellenistic age where you can start a library at the end students can appreciate how being a greek meant standing in the center of the world \( as least as far as the ancient greeks were concerned \) again there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity understand why every vote counts in a democracy and decide what makes somebody beautiful learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when throughout the book hart and mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions which remains the biggest legacy of the ancient greeks i teach classical greek roman mythology \( not to be confused with modern greek roman mythology apparently \) but i teach it online so i do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands on activities but that does not mean i cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on ancient greece although i am suddenly reminded of coming up with the sparthens \( a k a the warriors with the brains \) in elementary school but that is another story,positive
this book was so badly written that i just couldn t help writing my first review on amazon i never bothered writting reviews while i fully respect the authors decision in providing the book online under the creative commons license and while i do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions the book is a total f ck up and f ck up is an understatement the book 1 \) is unorganized i felt i was being bombarded by information from all directions one moment i was getting ready to test a simple hello world module and the other i m suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter how the hell did i get here it just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated 2 \) is upside down i read chapter 3 \( char drivers \) and i compare it to real device drivers and some things just don t match the book seems very theoretical because the real device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all after digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet i realize that in the real world there is a whole driver model and generic objects and what not reading the source code documentation and some online material i actually understand how the real drivers work i still don t understand the stuff in the book i start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver model and i find it in chapter 14 the driver model seems in my opinion the first step to understanding how real drivers work and i find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce not only that the authors decide that many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely and the complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high level view surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book 3 \) is sadistic one thing i really hated was the carrot and stick approach the authors chose first they give you a small tiny taste of a topic which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you re about to reach somewhere they do a complete u turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off the topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better you end up confused annoyed and duped like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the hello world module ok fine seems easy enough you naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself haha wroong the book suddenly does a make hello c without showing you the content of the makefile it leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable hello c and goes on describing in detail seemingly random stuff you are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter as is i chose the former hahaha wroong agaaiin i ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later \( at least they mentioned it \) in summary i d suggest you buy the book and \( as documentation managementstyle for another book says \) not read it burn it it s a great symbolic gesture i don t think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book if you come across any online material that recommends this book quickly discard that material too without thinking this is a 5 stars book it has affected me personally,negative
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara s pulitzer prize winning killer angels and because i m a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it s a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just isn t quite there any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear the hawks apparently are from atlanta but an atlanta team braves or hawks whichever would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season finally when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game he does so in the semi hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium not on the mound on the field this book was published posthumously and mr shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose prose that was excellent in killer angels it s unfortunate there are glimmers of interest in the book but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author s other book,negative

my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people s conceptions about going to the moon at that early time he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn t make much sense well from a layman s perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic physics and astronomy even from my scientifically deprived perspective a lot of things in the book didn t make much sense such as the actual method of getting to the moon but this doesn t really take away from the book it adds greatly to its appeal the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work and what these poor souls were going to come up with next compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality and much unlike his other works doesn t stray far from the earthly some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read if you drop at the sight of f \( x \) y then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today if you like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time,positive

harvey e goldberg is one of the pioneering sociologists in the study of the jewish communities of north africa especially the libyan jewish community in this present work he brings to bear the experience and knowledge of a lifetime of study and practice as a jew to provide an overall historical anthropological view of the jewish life cycle he opens with a chapter on being jewish then considers birth circumcision naming he goes on to discuss rituals of education and then has a central chapter on marriage an especially innovative section is on pilgrimage and creating identities in this one he opens one of the central themes of the book the way the increased importance of the individual in jewish life and thought has led to more varied religious practice his chapter on death mourning and remembering also includes a consideration of communal remembrance this is not as might be expected his closing chapter as he adopts the traditional teaching which he is reminded of by one of his many interviewees and ends with something good his final chapter is on bonds of community and individual lives this book is extremely well written and a delight to read i especially enjoyed the instances where he brings in personal anecdote to illustrate and deepen a set of observations goldberg has a true command of traditional jewish religious sources and these texts form one real basis of his life but what is especially exciting is his reading the communal variations across time in response the religious and communal demands as one long familiar with much jewish tradition and ritual i was surprised again and again by new observations and insights anyone who loves jewish learning will love this work tremendously i cannot recommend it more highly,positive

no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his experimental school who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of progressivism i would dewey s conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child s self posed questions the problems in dewey s model begin with his science fair meets museum meets playground meets lecture hall school design the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive classes are small and require several specialists and non reusable materials as if kids didn t have enough problems with the basic skills set already dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics even more outrageous in dewey s model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind how could dewey s recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child s intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance deweyism of course like many other off the wall theories of education denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted particularly project follow through the great skeleton in the student centered advocates closet i d personally like to see dewey s updated plan for seamlessly moving kids who come into class with their natural inquisitiveness programmed by tv rap music and other pop media into colonial american history calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes tennessee williams and the plus que parfait tense but of course such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old fashioned academic corpus along with the old fashioned school system 90 of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged maybe the answer doesn t lie in yielding to children s lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice dewey s progressivism relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education from the absurdity of it i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop out rates lowered standards and social discord but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one,negative
i have read baldacci s first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them this one however is just awful not only the character s dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows with lame lines like the gun was loaded and so was i that is exactly what this book is like except it goes on for 400 pages there isn t a single interesting character in this book in my opinion you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end it s the bataan death march of novels i hope this is an aberration i ll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good but one more stinker like this one and i ll drop his name from my reading list,negative

i am reading this for a college course called history of the american city this book is a typical college texbook in that it is filled with numbers dates percentages figures numbers oh did i say numbers dates figures and years oh and plenty of numbers the brilliant dilligent honored and esteemed scolar of a woman that wrote it sure knows her numbers facts years etc i on the other hand am absolutley hating it and foolishly i have allowed the drop date to pass so i have to read the book or fail the class i am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of understanding of any of these cities unless i am willing to spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps upon me needless to say from \( attempting \) reading it i am getting a headache and don t really even have the time to write this review i say that if even one person is deterred from reading this expose of numbers names dates figures facts percentages orders years dates and more numbers dates facts figures \( are you getting my drift yet \) it will be time well served though avoid this book please find another book maybe if people told the truth about this brand of writing more professors might have to teach and people like ms abu lughod wouldn t continue to make money off of writing books such as this and folks like her might have to write to communicate like the rest of us thank you for taking the time to read this ok i have to say it this sucks,negative

like most of the reviewers i went into this book expecting the humor and absurdity of the website and it s all there in it s ridiculous glory however this book is almost like two books in one upon reading the footnotes a much deeper tale begins to unfold beyond the nonsensical ramblings of robert the book tells a tale of a lonely kid using ninjas as an escape from his sad life his parents hate him he has no friends and nobody else listens to him except his babysitter and faithful dog the further you read the more you begin to see the deeper story unfold however even while the story gets darker the humor remains creating an experience that is both hilarious and touching check this book out,positive

i loved the first carole matthews novel i read for better or worse and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight but only because i didnt have anything else to do i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning to me matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her i think this is a horrible unrealistic messgage if you want to read something good pick up a jane green novel instead,negative
when i purchased this book i expected it would be life from a particular bacteria s perspective by this i mean well today our host started a new antibacterial therapy the last round of therapy was tough but we managed to make it through unscathed i m confident we ll survive unfortunately what i read was a scientific book written in non scientific language as a biology major in college and a medical student now i ve read many scientific books written in scientific language so many that they are pretty much all i can relate to anymore ha actually that statement has more truth in it than i care to admit but i thought this book would be a nice change of pace instead it s a listing of information about a certain bacterial species that i could have extracted from bergey s the book is undramatic and uninteresting i wouldn t recommend it to anyone,negative
reading through john irving s the cider house rules i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity in obtaining a bachelor s degree in english i had to read a lot of books among them were many books that i did not like but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along people become pregnant have abortions and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing the book doesn t flow naturally you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows playing the puppet master there are just so many coincidences so many old friends just happening to run into eachother so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly all of the characters vaguely distantly connected to eachother i don t want to spoil the plot but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames \( rhymes with screams \) family is just too much coincidence to bear it s as though the author is god and the characters completely lack free will and then there s the protagonist homer wells i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story homer wells barely does anything in the story he barely even speaks during the story he is virtually a non character devoid of personality or will around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all and they make up the majority of the book are without fail the most interesting scenes i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr larch but even melony seems more real than homer does the story is very long and rambling subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on minor characters keep popping into the story then disappearing only to pop back into the story exactly when they re needed conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten \( like the situation with debra pettigrew \) after such a rambling at times rather boring plot the ending feels rather rushed it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything tie up every loose end in the last 25 pages \( and tying up loose ends in this case means a lot of people conveniently dying \) to spoil the plot just a little homer wells who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion i personally am pro choice as well but i found that homer s sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily ever afters,negative
no doubt about it this book covers the history of the border patrol however it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a fluff piece than anything else as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent \( 13 years \) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job \( many say a necessity \) pacheco as an active agent \( when he wrote the book at least \) appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line \( i apologize for the pun \) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed if so then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security simply put the border patrol as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating remember the incompetence of fema \( a homeland security subcomponent \) well multiply that incompetence times ten heard about the poor morale of fema employees multiply that problem by one hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety percent of their time trying to get out those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs the bottom line is that as a former agent i lose sleep at night knowing what i know pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u s border patrol agent the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits read the book for enjoyment and homage just don t expect critical analysis in fact this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge \( for you ib agents in san diego \),negative
perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others lacking even the slightest trace of shame he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses as a result there s nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages even more pitiably like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to sanitize his clandestinely acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed one wearies quickly of the manichaean results and like any ideologically driven but technically inept would be nuclear \( or social \) engineer he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was why even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home s 1977 underground classic a savage war of peace considering that home s tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot s this is irony most profound it is scarcely surprising then that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear splittingly trumpeted in boot s book thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot s espoused belief system recently reprinted and highly recommended,negative

drummer hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of drummer hoff the man who fired it off in this story a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon each man brings something different one man brings the barrel one man brings the carriage and at the every end of each stanza it says but drummer hoff fired it off this story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story the colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal the story itself doesn t have any significant moral element to it it is just a fun book the rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous by the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud a good holiday gift,positive
i am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion i am not religious and i strive to take a learner s stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that i present to my students betsy and guilio maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics books that i have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias this particular work unfortunately is neither their gesture was genuine and gracious an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote no deity need take offense all were included in the pantheon of possibilities it is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors though written as an overview of many of the world religions this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other one point ought to be obvious though everything can t be true the religions mentioned are like oil and water they can t mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts an appeal to their similarities doesn t help we would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form it s the differences that are critical that s true in all areas of life especially the spiritual if god exists he s either personal or not personal he can t be both if god is merely a cosmic energy why ask his blessing he can t hear or respond if he s a person then he s someone not everyone this book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew,negative

if you are familiar with the work of strobel this book will continue to impress you if you are not however and would like to know where the author is coming from i encourage you to read his previous works the case for christ and the case for faith so that you might better understand strobel some people have condemned this book because strobel doesn t present the evolutionary side well i have a few quick observations to make first of all he s a journalist he asks tough questions and for the most part gets good responses second everyone has an agenda without exception strobel and those who he interviews analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern darwinian scientific views finally it is clear from the outset that strobel wants to make a compelling case for id this is not an unreasonable goal the fact that he doesn t interview evolutionists shouldn t bother anyone based on his obvious objectives if you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a point counter point series book if you want to understand the current id debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator this book is for you,positive
this text was assigned reading in a psych101 back in 1970 but its themes have stayed with me so strongly i am now ordering it for my personal library i was born with a club foot and experienced the power of being different even though my personal defect was so minor as to be rarely noticed by others stigma gave me an appreciation of the force behind my own shame and the reaction to my difference of others more importantly i learned about the degrees of identity which differences make the most difference \( sex race disabilities \) and the increasing intensity that comes with breaking the most closely held norms a classic study,positive

i didn t like the only other dean koontz book i ve ever read watchers but i enjoy reading kevin anderson s stuff so i thought i d give koontz another try because i m a reasonable person and i understand that not everyone can like everything by an author on to the review i realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but i think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through the dialog is mind numbing and predictable every time there was a car scene i could guess what kind of conversation would be held you drive too fast are you my mother over and over and over the idea was good a modern day frankenstein or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day \( yes i know frankenstein was the doctor not his monster but you get what i m saying \) but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would or like a play this book had so much potential but the authors laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn t made cost it dearly,negative
i couldn t finish this book after readng fairytale misfit insecure caucasian male falls for asian stripper prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets i thought possibly this story reveals a lot about olen butler he wrote about this relationship with such relish he sounds to me like a p c caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the otherness of asian people and doesn t see them for what they are just wants them to appreciate big strong white man i thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother so she was not honest with him but olen butler wrote about her as if this stripper pros was wonderful the kind of wife any man would want i shook my head and thought you have issues probably if she were caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something after this the other stories just did not appeal to me,negative

perhaps the long shadow of francis parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the french and indian war \( seven year s war \) whatever the reason it s good to see from the publication of several books that americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre revolutionary period when the british were triumphant and the indians still counted as a political force it s past time for a thorough revision of parkman who was ungenerous with the indians although i thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity for example the insensate fury of the iroquois actually the iroquois were less insensate than they were astute calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the english victory over the french in north america in particular he focuses on the frontier and the built in conflict of american settlers british policy and the indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the french or were betrayed by perfidious albion they made their point however in pontiac s war and by clearing white settlers from the frontier but their numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed this is a good book about the issues of the frontier between whites and indians in addition there s a good account of the french movement from canada to louisiana and the spanish rule in florida and the trans mississippi smallchief,positive

herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not the trial against paul merker in the east which had as its background east germany s reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance moreover they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia,negative

i am in the planning stages of a new business venture i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself this book reads like a list of useful one liner marketing tips and examples of how the author s friends have used them it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12 week commitment mailing list that the author has created he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks hello mcfly didn t i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights yes so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career my price of admission stops at the price of this book and it should not seem like i m only getting half of the story that i paid for,negative

the scientific method applied to this book 1 \) form a hypothesis great managers do something differently than mediocre managers 2 \) conduct an experiment interview 80 000 managers 3 \) analyze data this step is missing 4 \) draw conclusions write this book with the exception of the 12 questions the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study they make several insightful statements such as many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes however they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement did 90 of the managers interviewed state this did 60 of the great managers state this while only 10 of the mediocre managers did does many managers mean 100 managers 100 managers seems like many managers at first but considering 80 000 were interviewed i 100 managers is a negligible amount the entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study it seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently the authors found almost no common trends however since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study they needed something to show for it and wrote this book if buckingham and coffman didn t claim this book was a result of the largest study of its kind i would say it offers some decent advice however since it does make this claim i wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are,negative

now i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person in fact probably more than the next person since the average next person hasn t ever read any tales of derring do adventures to unexplored distant lands lost civilizations great artifacts etc that s all good stuff what s not good is this book which is tedious in the extreme on the surface of it haggard s followup to his hugely successful \( and infinitely better \) king solomon s mines has all the elements a dynamic duo of scholar adventurers \( one of whom is descended from pharaohs \) a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man an expedition to africa and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life however despite this promising laundry list haggard s execution leaves a great deal to be desired a friend described it rather aptly as a book with a lot of story but not a lot of plot which is to say that in my edition some 320 pages are filled without much happening there is the initial mysterious set up the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations the heroes conveyance to the lost city and then and then things kind of grind to a halt lengthy descriptive details lengthy internal ruminations lengthy rambling speeches lengthy everything but very little of consequence occurs until the very end when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh everlasting life i suspect much of the problem stems from the book s origin as a long running serial in the gazette as i understand it serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment and thus it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words judicious editing could reduce the book to 1 3 of its size without any loss of note of course as another friend pointed out it s probably best to read the book is small chunks just as one would have done with installments spreading out one s reading of it over a period of time he suggests may serve to conceal the book s rambling nature in any event there are some nice scenes here and there such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches but those are about all i m likely to recall from this book in a year of course as is noted in the introduction to my edition haggard lifted the main elements of the plot and even the the true name of she who must not be named from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer lytton so one can t even give him much credit for imagination i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen racism anti semeticism misogyny fear of miscegenation etc but as entertainment for the modern reader it falls woefully short of the mark,negative

talk about taking the joy out of an experience i read this book prior to a week long trip to venice this book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives it is a poor guidebook and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue the history and art of venice are covered better in books from those genres the only upside is that it is short yuck what a waste of time my advice is get a novel about venice if you like novels a guidebook if you want that an art book or a history book at least you ll get something out of those this one tries all of these and fails actually in terms of a travelogue vendela in venice far surpassess any other venice book i have seen although i originally bought it because it is considered a children s book it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it,negative

it s easy to realize once again what makes garth ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading this one throughout the story i was unable to predict what was going to happen on the next page and despite ennis making this into a rollercoaster ride he still keeps it all believable mind you this story is not on par with the preacher series not much is but it still is a story that rises far above the average comic book story the characters are all interesting often funny and they ll hold your attention with ease not once was the story faltering and in the case of you being a smoker maybe at the end you ll be cured of that habit as another reviewer pointed out this is one hell of an anti smokers add so if you feel like picking up a well told story with constantine in the lead you ll do best to pick up this one if however you are not yet acquainted with ennis s preacher than you better turn to that one,positive
look the fact is feminism is about choice no more no less i have the highest respect for stay at home moms it is the hardest darn job on earth but this woman is way off base to say that feminism sold us a lie feminism gave us a choice it told us we did not have to pretend to believe we were june cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls personally i could not have children and only feminists have not made me feel like an alien species i work with troubled teens my skills do not go to waste i spoil my nieces and nephews i am fulfilled and happy my sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys she is fulfilled and happy feminism gave us those choices ladies we were not sold anything we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us if you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world s most important job i think that is your issue and not now s stop blaming feminism for your insecurities if you are feminist stop blaming your mother for your insecurities you have choices because of feminism not despite it,negative
i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling while reh was first and foremost a story teller pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather s remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades this as previous reviewers have mentioned creates a large gap between reader and story but why do this why use such a crappy method of story telling i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue all in all it s a slow uninspired day dream story so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews i want my money back,negative
i was very excited when i got my copy of this book i am a big fan of medical thrillers i started with robin cook and michael palmer and from then on i was hooked unfortunately for me i selected the wrong book it was very slow and he didn t pick up the pace until i was about 60 pages from the end then all hell broke loose i have a feeling that josh got a little help from people telling him to spice it up all in all i was disappointed and still don t know what perv means hope he does better on his second i will give it a try but only the first 50 pages if he hasn t hooked me by then i ll give up,negative

i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title i read this book because it was the subject of an on line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group,negative
neverwhere is one of gaiman s best yet i highly recommend this novel,positive

bailie draws on rene girard s theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence i found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory producing a hard hitting indictment of all forms of violence whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act increasingly i find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice i have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading violence unveiled nor do i react to photojournalism with my previous detachment the impact stays with me despite the fact that i read the work initially two years ago when i borrowed it from a friend i now have my own copy heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by bailie s excellent analyses provocative and insightful,positive
i expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts too technical proofs homework questions irrelevant to the material insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are this book really surprised me because it wasn t mathy at all it doesn t just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts which means you only need common sense not an intensive mathematical background to get everything the examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts each easily and naturally leads to the next if there s anything not thoroughly elaborated they were sure to cover it in the homework questions by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them not just how to plug numbers into some formula if anything i d say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little but then again you could always just skip the easier parts,positive
although everything is shown in silhouette there is plenty of color and action and my kids \( boy and girl now 3 and 5 \) have always like it there are herds of elephants steaming machines flowers critters and more as the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find i won t say more but in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they didn t like them but i think they miss the point the book is about shapes and how much you can identify without the advantage of a detailed picture and looking at the silhouette and identifying the item creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story if you used pictures you d hardly learn anything about shapes would you no the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds for reaching for that aristotelian abstract \( lol \) of what is skunk and it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with seuss odd artwork five stars 19 pages of fun for boys and girls this sturdy boardbook is a good read aloud that stretches the imagination,positive
rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in cross creek florida in the early 1900s it is often assigned reading for teens but i doubt that most of them can appreciate it her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior the lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies she turned those into a cookbook which i ll have to try out modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the n word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible drunken immoral etc it is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written so recognize it as a snapshot of the times then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book \( i deducted 1 star for this \) the reader becomes absorbed in rawlings love of the land and the creation of a home it gives much the same feelings as a year in provence or under a tuscan sun,positive
i ll put my opinion first so there won t be any doubt in your mind i don t believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character people are just too different too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you how well can you predict what people in your own country will do would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as mr barzini i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man s views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history socio economic patterns religion family etc but the specific results are just that specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last the tragedy of italy s long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page myself i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy read another book if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you,negative
i got this book when it first came out and read it straight away i absoloutely loved it and highly reccomend it lief is trying to be a great ruler but can t not with the famine and death in deltora but with a perilious map our heroes set out to destroy the four sisters that are causing the deaths in deltora an exceptional addition to the previous books and is reccomended to fans who want a little more adventure in their reading well done emily rodda i like this book as much as all the others this is the best deltora series and i say it proudly but after all deltora quets hasn t finished not yet,positive
moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas s writings on discourse ethics written in the early eighties this translation which was published in 1990 provides a developmental perspective the focus of the essays moves from habermas s statements about the role of philosophy today in philosophy as stand in and interpeter to his writing on reconstructive social science in general to his program for a discourse ethics in particular the final papers address criticisms of this program the volume suffers a bit from the fact that thomas mccarthy s introduction is keen to locate habermas s position vis a vis various contemporary moral philosophical standpoints but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of habermas s overarching social theoretic project,positive
to learn some italian before visiting italy i tried multiple language learning programs borrowed from my local library some were ridiculous many required using a workbook then i stumbled on the pimsleur program which is totally audio allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work due to the pedagogically sound method pimsleur developed for language learning i actually did learn some basic italian as a result i bought conversational italian though i ve never considered myself adept at language learning i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds i ve raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language,positive
this is a charming little book it s very concise profusely illustrated and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids it delightfully summarizes the work of plato theaetetus archimedes euclid kepler and euler in only 57 pages half of which contain only illustrations as a model builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra i was a little concerned when i looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about sacred geometry fortunately \( at least from my point of view \) it does not contain a word about it except for a cursory reference to the elements plato associated with each of the platonic solids a table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids all the info a model builder needs this book won t impress anyone with a mathematics background but for a layman like me it s a perfect introduction kudos to sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format,positive

though i usually go in for tough police thrillers i sometimes mix things up by reading a light funny mystery or like this book a quiet thoughtful mystery set in a small town \( a cozy i believe this type of mystery novel is called \) still life nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a cozy mystery quirky eccentric characters a small town setting pretty much no violence with a little modernity in the form of occasional well placed profanity \( though not much \) and modern demographics \( a gay couple is included among the main characters \) the main detective character intelligent and interesting owes a little to christie s hercule poirot but not everything the mystery itself is pretty interesting too though some aspects of its solution are a little broad and clunky as are some of the explanations of why ultimately cleared characters were acting suspicious for a time any shortcomings are quibbles however and shouldn t deter one from trying out this nicely done mystery story set in a quiet little corner of quebec,positive

this book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys exalted the book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows the book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses that is the only way i can discribe it there is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat and then others that are there is a section on warstriders basicly single man death machines that basicly look like large metal robots most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like i don t like saying that is what they look like because well this is rping people things change by a player gm s perception anyway enough of my ramblings this book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to royal class warstriders this book is about gear in the world of exalted p s it looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books my best guess is that one will be for sorcery but that is just one book if you think of anything else post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones,positive
in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details witty asides and \( especially \) luxuriously reproduced introductions hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages he hopes to provide brief non intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science there is astonishingly little text and at times the pithiness compactness and occasional cuteness may work against readers understanding there s perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader \( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time event horizons and brane world models \) the text is aided greatly however by the beautifully rendered four color illustrations even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design s artwork will attract engage and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation overall then the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated yet it s certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further if you re looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here i strongly recommend \( as does hawking \) alan guth s the inflationary universe or brian greene s the elegant universe,positive

i thoroughly enjoyed the author s earlier work on how the irish saved civilization but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book taken in its subparts many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight where s the big picture the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks variety of human response lightening quick transmutations resourcefulness and inexhaustible creativity a subtitle like a greek treasury of personal vignettes might have been more descriptive and merited another star but it falls short as a hinge of history with impoverished and even maladaptive connections \( fdr as solon really \) to the modern world i am sorry to not recommend it,negative
there are just too many errors of interpretation omission and commission in this book to justify purchasing it in this review we will concentrate on rima s \( r \) handling of the work of j m keynes on p 84 r s claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is surprisingly suggestive of j m keynes s idea has no supporting evidence to back it up on p 133 r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand a la keynes what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and or intuition that ricardo s deductive analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking \( or assuming away \) the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo in chapter 20 of r s book she attempts to deal with keynes s theory of effective demand and keynes s discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20 titled the employment function r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book replacing her chapter 20 with keynes s chapter 20 r s figure 20 1 discussed on pages451 454 directly contradicts keynes s analysis,negative
this book unlike morris s work on hillary is actually worth reading because its perspective and analysis of our 42nd president is fascinating though the title is a little tiresome \( and becomes especially so when morris continues to say throughout the book why because he could \) the book is a fast page turner i particularly enjoyed morris s portrayal of clinton as one who only came to life around other people if they were happy he was if they were in distress he felt their pain a master of reading people and changing according to their feelings clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president who ruled by polls enter dick morris as clinton s chief poller he also became at one time his chief political advisor and clinton needed one as my life by clinton shows the president had no overall strategy and failed to see events as interconnected for him each issue needed to be examined individually and with clinton that was a laborious endeavor the prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with equal weight and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious to take action result fiasco s like waco somalia bosnia and health care reform more seriously for the future the loss of the congress to the republicans \( over ten years now and counting \) and the failure to stop bin laden morris gives credit where credit is due though clinton s work on welfare reform cut the roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction allowed the economic boom of the 1990s to take place also interesting was clinton s use of the presidency as a bully pulpit for families and education an issue that was local politics and therefore cost clinton nothing in the budget but brought in massive political capital read this book before reading clinton s my life why because morris points out the inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein also morris says that the president s autobiography is the rosetta stone that decodes clinton if that is the case then morris is certainly the interpreter,positive
reinventing the bazaar used real life examples to make markets understandable to any reader from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers eyes he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets and in my opinion he succeeds each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points while the book has an economic undertone the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student all terminology is explained not only with words but with examples as well the book was enjoyable especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings however i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book,positive

as i read this book when madeline was young i felt as though i was lost wandering through a forest searching for something a beautiful butterfly a perfect flower a mystical cottage but there s nothing there it s just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all and that s how this book is written it is a tangle of thoughts and words spread from the first page to the last nothing special at all i ve read all of jane hamilton s books i loved the book of ruth adored a map of the world they were both wonderful and i will always have positive comments for them but i doubt i will ever buy another book by ms hamilton it s not that i want a formula book but i do want to read something that i can relate to and i don t relate to this at all i don t like mac the narrator his mother is just plain strange and not endearing or believable at all i can t stand buddy his cousin the rest of the characters i barely know and quite frankly don t want to get to know perhaps i ve changed since her first book came out perhaps the author has but whatever the differences my love of jane hamilton s books has ended sadly,negative

i read the good doctor s book eat to live and then bought china study which he talks a lot about in this book then i bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though i do feel he s being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own being a vegetarian for more than 37 years i became an almost 100 vegan after reading eat to live and have to say that i feel great with more energy and even started reducing anti depression med i ve been taking for severe depression yesterday i took my last pill all week i ve been emptying my refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow and reducing my one cup of coffee in the norning to none because i remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache i m going to do 10 days and hoping for 14 i ve done 3 day fast before and one 5 day and that was great yes there are some flaws in both books and i wish the good doctor would have made use of a good editor as it s not as professionally written as it could be and the recipes in eat to live are atrocious with too much canned foods and not healthy organic foods but i ll forgive him because he got me on the china study which changed my life and his studies and own experience helping people get well are good and inspiring why am i going on a 10 day detox water diet i read randall fitxgerald s one hundred year lie and that was the catalyst that pulled it all together for me a detox fast absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many years on anti depressants i m keeping dr fuhrman s fasting book close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and encouragement i did make the mistake of telling my coworkers that i was starting a 10 day fast though the good doctor warned me not to the comments from them were typical i suppose knowing their health or lack of but i held my tongue those comments are just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of dr fuhnman s books make along with other nutrituion books but i thinkof the wisest words you are responsible for your own health and think about my not being able to remember the last time i had a cold and the last flu i had in 1964 and smile i don t intend to support the ill begotten medical pharmecutical industry the last time i went to the dr i promptly firedhim after his continued to badger me into getting manograms and other tests i repeated that i eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do with breast cancer and i just walked out of his office forever i d rather read a book,positive

a good friend of mine insisted i d read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life in the end i was very disappointed not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton s whole attitude he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant narrow minded attitude once again for the next chapter how can anyone claim they ve learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth i have no desire to read any more of his books,negative
tedious and inane come to mind it is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a catty pseudo feminist style rambling descriptions of egyptian archaeology real or imagined thinly veiled racist comments about the ignorant natives of egypt and inept sexual innuendo the book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced the characters do not come across as real very disappointing leave this one on the library shelf,negative

dr hawkins first book power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology however he began to venture into misapplication of this method and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity concept or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement there are serious logical philosophical and practical flaws in his work and his attempt to quantify matters that aren t quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques the actual technique is worthwhile but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate valid answers hawkins explores issues about media politics religion spirituality history philosophies healing arts entertainment and more and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters liars and two faced sociopaths he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don t resort to hawkins misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful responsible work in those areas for now i d encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world,negative

first let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail he does not he hikes less than a third you dont find this out until 2 3 through the book which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad to an ill effort to fulfill a contract my conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher could not and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics as others have said in this review forum this book can be snide highschoolish and down right mean i fail to see the wit in his endless negitivity and bashing this book has a few funny parts but i cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments it is so unbelievible in places that you know you are on an imagined tangent dont waste your money or time i am so happy i bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale,negative
i only glanced through this book yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied i can however write about one of the editors mike shaw who made no attempt whatsoever to find the evidence when assessing us as parents he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an expert witness and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were at risk of neglect mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched under cross examination he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations luckily for us he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist i don t know about his co editors but if his work is anything to go by the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously evidence gathering on 9 8 02 i interviewed mr mrs orman 2 hours on 21 8 02 i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone 40 mins witnessed contact 1 hour and spoke to the children without their parents 20 mins and i interviewed the foster carer 2 hours observations mr mrs orman were friendly and co operative throughout mr orman showed insight but wasn t concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children the couple were very robust in refuting the welfare s account which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation contact took place in the park the parents and children seemed happy to see each other they chatted in animated style i wasn t aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children s presence interviewing the children the children seemed attentive but answered don t know fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions erin related a simpsons episode where homer had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman s temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed note this is submitted in court as an evidence based legal document conclusions recommendations i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact i think there is some insecurity in the children s attachment to their parents note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs asked whether he had any regrets mr orman didn t take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care erin who was 8 at the time needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper and support and advise socially i suspect mr orman would find this difficult my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging sic children the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed sic and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home returning home is likely to further retard the children s social and emotional development these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause i also find very plausible ms charlotte curran s suggestion \( in her written statement \) that mr orman dominates his wife the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible i believe the children need a long term placement away from home with experienced foster carers contact should be gradually reduced mike shaw s answers under cross examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6 hour investigation yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed so that the children could lead a normal and happy life he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70 of all children placed in long term foster care end up as delinquents our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt and the case was eventually closed so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions,negative

i picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands on science activities that are essential to good teaching and effective learning unfortunately i discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific establishment with credulity for numerous fringe ideas the first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you ll be home for dinner sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as evidence the do it yourself promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn t intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or doesn t happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants \( such as the speed of light \) to nine significant figures far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given \( in chapters about the feeling of being stared at or feeling the touch of a severed limb \) despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book i liked a part of its message that important science can still be done by amateurs that s about the only aspect of this book that is commendable,negative

the chocolate war the chocolate war was one of the best books i have ever read not the chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene the boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot i would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate i don t think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level this story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out i think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of archie archie is a suspicious character that knows every one i wish this book was more school appropriate but it isn t and was a horrid book therefore this book would be great if the author published a book with the sam story but more school appropriate situations and words,negative

anyone with intelligence can see that ann coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective analysis of politics she is using inflammatory marketing to stir up the emotions of the most die hard flag waving conservatives until this attention seeking labeling of other americans as good or bad stops there will never be true understanding of the complexties of american politics or foreign policy by the general public i don t agree with bush s war and i didnt vote for him but he s not a bad person he did not invade iraq because he is evil or stupid i can appreciate both sides of an argument i can avoid generic categorizations i would never watch any news liberal or conservative that had a clear political bias why can t ann coulter arrive at this same level of common sense well she wouldnt sell as many books she wouldnt be on tv it has to be liberals hate america or the conservative nazi agenda we have the duty as thinking americans in the most advanced free country in the world in these modern times of massive amounts of free information to stop paying attention to this garbage get the facts and stop relying on a figurehead to spoon feed you your opinions,negative
the author is reusing a similar plot device than in twisted a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything that is a poor strategy for a mystery novel because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes the narrative in general is not kellerman at his best either the characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do a small part of the book talks about brazil and kellerman simply invents a couple of portuguese words making them sound spanish \( favilla favillitos \) one wonders how much of the author s research is similarly fictional in sum a book carelessly executed,negative
the savory way is an early \( 1990 \) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author deborah madison so as ms madison has a new book on the way i thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so i can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books ms madison is a former colleague of alice waters and lindsey shere at chez panisse who specializes in a very general way like mollie katzen and madhur jaffrey on dishes that fit into a vegetarian lifestyle note that the term vegetarian especially as used by these three authors is extremely misleading as it is much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of everything under the sun except meat fowl fin fish and shell fish both madison and jaffrey make extensive use of milk cheese yoghurt and eggs madison s objective in this book is in fact to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be done without using animal flesh the book s title may be a bit misleading to some foodies in that savory is often one of the words used to divide dishes in two great groups of savory and sweet this book in fact includes two rather long chapters on sweets a first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the many recipes the first thing you need to know if you are put off by chatty recipe books is that these notes are almost exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved with the recipe and how to get the best results from your ingredients while little stories about the historical provenance of a recipe may interest many including myself that is not what this book is about on top of this i firmly agree with the blurbed opinion from mollie katzen who compliments both her cuisine and her writing almost all professional culinary writers are pretty good or have an excellent copy editor at work on their prose but ms madison is a food service professional who writes very well i often wish the soon to be beknighted jamie oliver had a bit more talent with words as i find his books so comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors the very first attraction of the book is its table of contents which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book this is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes suitable for just about any time of the day including a good selection of recipes very good for breakfast the eleven recipe chapters are quick bites with 40 pages of recipes for sandwiches toasts and spreads salads to start or make a meal with 42 pages soups and stews with 50 pages of thick thin and pureed soups including a new one with my favorite fall ingredient chestnuts eighteen quick pasta dishes for five and company 32 pages stovetop vegetables 27 pages of sautes and braises baked and roasted vegetables 25 pages with ratatouille gratins tians and other goodies grilled vegetables and their sauces 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish down to earth 26 pages on rice potatoes and beans \( although beans appear throughout all chapters \) morning foods for day and night 26 pages of eggs and cheese and cereals and breads finishing touches 31 pages of sauces salsas condiments dressings pastes and you name it desserts 45 pages on fruit dishes cream cheeses pastries and custards sweetmeats 12 pages on sweet pastes peels syrups dried fruits and other dessert dressings every recipe i examined is relatively simple to prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may find with jaffrey or jack bishop and great tips on understanding the recipes and the ingredients the appendix is just right for the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the second floor at zabars ms madison puts it all in perspective by highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots the mortar and pestle a few good knives the food mill and the pizza stone and peel the chapter on the pantry has lots for the novice and a few good tips for the foodie such as the fact that mexican olive oils can be very spicy possibly the best items in the appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as entertaining feeding large groups and fitting into a low fat diet \( note that for the number of recipes in this book this low fat list is surprisingly short \) the list of sources is short with no internet sites provided but i recognize that virtually all of these vendors are still in business the bibliography is also brief but hits all the right titles especially joy larkcom s excellent the salad garden this book is a great resource for liberal vegetarians who simply eschew meat i would add this to madhur jaffrey s world vegetarian peter berley s the modern vegetarian kitchen and jack bishop s the complete italian vegetarian to create a great core vegetarian library i cannot at this time compare this to ms madison s other books as this is the first i have read although i sense many of her more recent books have a narrower scope focusing on vegetable dishes i plan to review her other books in the next few days highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in general,positive

this book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all you could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did book doesnt show you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them it also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn t even bother to read it before sending it to the presses it is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used,negative

i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it and being through with it now i feel as though i ve learned very little i had so many problems with this book or rather the way of writing mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author that this was a difficult read in his defense he is in most things very thorough my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was \( or as he sometimes put it must have been \) thinking or feeling while i give mr bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject in my opinion that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views since he himself stresses that leonardo s famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo s life the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter but only puts forward his own opinion and his reasons why he believes what he does without explaining the opposite side of the matter in this manner he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter sentences beginning with i think or in my view are not uncommon he also makes certain assumptions about the reader referring often to other artists works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them also he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo s often drawing attention to coloring or texture without ever showing it though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout the author is an undoubtedly intelligent well learned man very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned but entirely overbearing in his writing overall unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and don t mind being pulled out of a book by the author s views then i would highly suggest staying away from this one,negative
i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper s the dark is rising is plain awful this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read i must say it was a waste of my time to read dark never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero in this case we are told that on his 11th birthday an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of the old ones unlike jk rowling who in the first pages of harry potter the philosopher s \( or sorcerer s \) stone provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny with an unruly mop of black hair startlingly green eyes and of course a lightning bolt scar on his forehead cooper does not describe will stanton at all the result is that the reader after having read 244 pages still cannot visualize what will looks like i also find quite annoying cooper s approach to this good vs evil tale she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones and who or what exactly is the dark as for the dark being evil all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold snow and of course darkness excuse me but is this the best cooper can do is this what this book is about the druid pagan worldview of light vs dark summer vs winter warmth vs cold what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil,negative

i am leading a christian study group using popular films i was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some scriptural truth unfortunately the author was much less interested in a christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the church i know that churches have problems and hurt people but it is not as common as this author seems to assert he seems very angry at the church \( and for some reason all of western culture especially america \) living in n ireland could make one suspicious of religion i assume but despite his claims to be a chrisitan so concerned about commmunity he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up it is a good study of film \( not movies he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person \) but not very useful in the context of the church that s my take anyway god bless,negative

quiller s guide is the most systematic color text available it combines a deep knowledge of traditional color theories with a huge amount of quiller s personal research into how paints actually mix as colors central to the book is quiller s color mixing wheel for watercolors oils and acrylics probably the most accurate color wheel available in any published work \( though he has a revised color wheel available separately \) he explores the monochrome analogous complementary and split complementary color schemes through many demonstration paintings and detailed mixing instructions he emphasizes repeatedly the importance of a strong value composition and careful variations in color saturation in building the painting an indispensible book,positive

i m on page 110 of this book the book has 220 pages i m half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person i am angry with i bought this book because i have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me but it is having the opposite affect i feel i was duped into buying it \( because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews \) part 1 tells us what a grievance is it tells us and tells us again and again and again the thing is i already know what a grievance is i know i m angry at someone and i know it s not healthy i know to forgive would help me i didn t need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages all that reading did was make me dwell and think more about the problem and increased my anger because of the book itself when i reached part 2 entitles forgiveness i thought finally but all part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction how great the study was and how much it will help me there are some great reviews of this book here at amazon and if this book helped some people that is great but so far i can t agree with any of the positive comments i have a great degree of respect for stanford university i went to high school across the street from stanford and have taken classes there but it pains me to have such a great school s name attached to this book is it fair of me to write a review of a book i have not finished no but i m afraid to continue reading it i m already angry and to buy a book that i thought would help me only to find it frustrating me i don t feel is not all that fair either,negative

a mind opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy and a degree in psychology \( although i m not giving up the meds just yet \) i m amazed by how clearly yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have the case histories he describes are priceless on the negative side yapko can be just a bit condescending at times it s clear he thinks his way is the only way and although he mentions other theories of depression he favors the nurture theory of ineffective learned thought patterns claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature \( maybe next lifetime he ll be a woman and get to experience menopause \) yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people depressives which is the kind of labeling we could do without the most serious criticism i have is that his learn by doing exercises are sometimes impractical if not downright silly for example to learn about perceived control yapko writes spend a few days asking a partner for permission to do everything such as can i go to the bathroom \( can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day \) other exercises tell you to interview at least a dozen people or sometime when you feel playful experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things like flying what depressed person feels playful many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person s capabilities especially those of us who are older and have physical disabilities however i do plan to complete the written exercises having outlined these minor drawbacks i have to say it s an excellent book after all these years i finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression,positive

let me start by saying that normally i m a big popcorn fan i read any article that she s quoted in i ve read the popcorn report at least twice and loved it the same for clicking great book they re part of my permanent library so i was more than disappointed after the first few chapters of eveolution i hung in there as long as i could but the male bashing that pervades the early part of the book overwhelmed whatever golden nuggets were in its way i just couldn t tolerate reading any more perhaps her comments about or against men are warranted in some people s view but i didn t see how they fit in with the intent of the book the comments seemed gratuitous and unnecessary so hopefully her next book will be better,negative
i am a big fan of the missing manual series previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient i therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm office is such a gargantuan program with tons of bells and whistles that microsoft itself estimates that most users take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities however the book is a major disappointment because of its many mistakes and poor organization most of the mistakes are ones you can work around for example on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes a and b are reversed but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction every few pages i find myself going to the missing manuals web site to report yet more errata such as incomplete or wrong instructions figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions incomprehensible writing seeming confusion between the mac and pc versions of the program etc and i agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index it looks as though o reilly publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book but instead rushed it out as soon as possible that is too bad because i will now be much more hesitant to purchase another missing manuals title,negative
the book is obviously well researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting however the author included a lot of details that just really didn t matter as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book my professor was able to bring dr schrag to talk to our class he was a good lecturer keeping the class interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style i think he would have much more success as an author,negative

the content of this book is adequate but the layout leaves much to be desired the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents pages are not labeled with chapter information such as which chapter that page belongs to the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book i would rate it much higher,negative

despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is not a computer crime novel in fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal in the first few pages we re introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she s gone and the book spirals into japanese gangs corrupt police horribly bland and indistinguishable characters and it just sucks from then on out the story is good albeit incorrectly marketed the characters however have no identity they all sound the same with the exception of the japanese characters sadly the book lacks serious writing talent very little character development on what could ve been a good story one positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of japanese culture etc are really good perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from england to japan my advice spend some time abroad again,negative

i did a course on quantum theory in the 1970s with john ward who was recommended for the nobel prize in 1965 \( feynman schwinger and tomogana shared it \) those close to the action will know of ward s identity john \( died in 2002 from memory \) used feynman s lectures as his course notes i must confess a soft spot for feynman i would have loved to have been in his lectures \( buy his audio tapes and you will get the feel for his delivery \) he was truly a great physics communicator and often understated his mathematical abilities \( after all he had won the putnam prize at some stage so he was no mathematical slouch \) his development of qed is simple to understand and that says it all about his genius he took the view that if he couldn t give a simple explanation then he really didn t understand the topic the current crop of tool polishers should heed this anyone who is really serious about physics \( and maths \) should read the original papers and this is a classic example i suggest that you fill in the gaps in the derivations if you can t do that then you haven t really understood it it is fascinating to compare feynman s approach with schwinger s more abstract approach i prefer feynman s but schwinger does a hugely impressive job in stripping qed down to its logical \( almost truth functional \) essentials buy this book and see how a first class mind works peter haggstrom bondi beach australia,positive
ironweed by william j kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i ve recently joined the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie \( at the group meeting \) that was based on the novel as i expected the movie paled in comparison to the book despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself jack nicholson plays the main character \( francis \) and meryl streep is his wanna be socialite girlfriend \( helen \) but this star power doesn t elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel set during the great depression ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society drunks homeless impoverished and in that regard the story is timeless i enjoyed the characters quirkiness and the loosely connected plots but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption forgiveness and love the love aspect may be hard to spot but it is there unconventionally in many of the character s interactions this favorable recommendation comes with a warning it can be a depressing read definitely not a happy one and while i found it inspirational it will not conjure any blithe emotions ironweed is definitely not a june beach read being more apropos to a long winter night indoor by a warm fire,positive

i got the impression that rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor it was superficial with such helpful hints as people come in all sizes and shapes and people with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly i didn t need to read her book to figure those out her logic is also flawed she states that doctors touch patients not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them not because of any power status using the book to promote her feminist beliefs numerous typographical errors and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer,negative
definitely a wonderful book for those following the teachings of the other books this book provides more useful information the path that castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views \( read the other reviews \) i found it useful to read and judge for myself what castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon thus the angry reviews of those calling castaneda a fraud due to their own failure its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own specialness jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book i believe castaneda s genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated i am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom,positive

i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years i was born raised in the north i think evans should rename his book fiddler on the roof in the south his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history as it was in the past here it s very much the southern jews were all so happy they all fit in and were accepted etc he does cite a few instances where they had problems but these usually involved us yankee jews like the instances when a few \( yankee \) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights evans should realize that times have really changed here the evangelical christians in my town \( which is most people here \) harrass me like crazy i am praying for you have you read the words of jesus who was a jew like you when will you come to my church blah blah blah thank god for the minority of catholics methodists presbyterians and a few others who live here they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am and the way i will stay a jew i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences and that they cannot relate to what i am saying but i do want to ask evans a few questions 1 \) if things are so great for the jews in the south why have you lived in new york for decades now 2 \) why don t you at least write either a new forward to the book a magazine article etc contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time \( for some of us at least \) primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians i read evans books before i moved here and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here for a jew who really cares about her his religion living here is depressing it is practically jew less and at best the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me \( by the way i am planning to move to a city \) by the way don t bother writing to me to tell me that i am wrong or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church believe me with all the praying for me that is going on in this town and all the myriad attempts to convert me if it hasn t happened by now as they say in these parts it just ain t gonna happen,negative

this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m a work i decided to read it i thought the book was excellent but maybe unnecessarily long the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job this book is a must for everyone else that just likes good non fiction this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era,positive

after reading all the author s books so far i realized he is repeating himself in all his books \( including the ones which myron bolitar isn t present \) there are the same elements in the plot disappeared person who might or not be dead mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot the hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved in the last minute someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot but no one knows for sure as the plots became being built upon the same structure the suprise is getting less and less after each book being someone who started liking mistery books after reading all agatha christie s ones and because each book of hers is completely diferent from the other i look for the same originality in other mistery books of course the book is good for a first time harlan coben reader i just didn t like it that much because of the repetitions which make very easy to guess the final spoiling the suspense of the reading,negative

this book is pitched at least in part to linux beginners but it fails in small maddening ways when speaking to this audience after a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install page 65 tells you to run the man command in a shell session it offers no clue that the only way to terminate a man command is the letter q a completely unintuitive action so a new user can flounder forever or at least until they get frustrated and reboot but i don t mean to slam just this book that same problem exists in most other beginning linux books even o reilly s pocket guide all these knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow magically gain access to information that the authors have in their heads but haven t committed to paper except for that it s a very good book,positive

i found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents i flipped though it and it looked dated but interesting so i decided to get it as other reviewers mention it is dated but you gotta know that up front when you get it it s published in 1986 when there were no \( well almost no \) home computers so you have to accept up front that it s talking about organizing papers using more papers but that s something we still all got to do occasionally so it s a system of notepads file folders etc it does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers etc and what you can do about it however it does get overly complex and really doesn t seem applicable in today s world where there are far fewer homemakers who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files as this book seems to be focused on finally i have to mention that it was the continual religion related references that put me off to the book in the end others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it but for me i felt i was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable just my personal taste i m sure some others will disagree with this judgement but i have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text i gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin,negative

the boston based author dennis lehane wrote a great detective story with a social background so great it is almost more important than the plot mystic river differs from lehane s other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer mystic river is set in the fictional boston suburb called east buckingham \( the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester \) home mostly to white working class with plenty of crime i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it knowing the area the first part which is the base and explanation for later events takes place in 1975 when one of the three eleven year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple smelling car and although he comes back after four days his life as well as his friends is changed forever the ways of the boys soon part dave \( the boy taken by the men \) lives a quiet life has a wife and a son and likes his memories of being a football player in high school jimmy the bad boy after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen year old daughter from his first marriage second wife and their two daughters the third boy college educated sean becomes a policeman when jimmy s beautiful daughter katie is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood sean gets assigned to the case there are many leads to different people but the case is difficult meanwhile jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own the plot is very good until the end and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate the characters are very real especially jimmy and sean who are central to the plot their trauma after dave s abduction made a lasting effect on their lives in very different ways they are complicated multifaceted people very well developed as literary characters some side protagonists depicting perhaps types rather than individuals \( bobby roman the savage brothers sergeant whitey \) are very good i was in the grasp of this book until the end it is not only great entertainment but also food for thought the movie based on mystic river with sean penn is equally moving recommended for those with little time,positive
though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology it s the dryest most aesthetically difficult to read textbook especially if you happen to be studying the material online through independent study the publisher needs to redesign the book and or you need to have a better online course professor it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material \( which is interesting in itself \) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction,negative
the venona secrets is a deceptive book it tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of soviet spying in the us but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing liberals than in painting a true portrait of their subject although the information the authors provide is interesting the biased and heavy handed way it s presented negates whatever scientific value it might have for example the authors insist that j robert oppenheimer was working for the soviets \( they call this a fact \) yet they present absolutely no proof that oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic naive man who couldn t keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of communism in america was money to the cpusa the book is full of these so called facts with little to nothing to back them up the authors praise joe mccarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti communist hysteria of the 1940 s and 1950 s ignoring the fact that mccarthy capitalized on fears of communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal mccarthy s methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by stalin are completely overlooked as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign the authors also praise senator henry jackson as some sort of all american crusader against communism not even mentioning that all of jackson s anti communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti semistism and hatred of blacks overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of liberal ideology one can simply hear the disdain for liberals dripping from the authors prose and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right wing propaganda who want an objective account of venona the authors have sacrificed their credibility for their conservative agenda they deserve not to be taken seriously,negative

first off i d like it better if we had 1 2 star options judas unchained really doesn t deserve a 2 more a 2 1 2 or 2 3 4 i have a love hate relationship with peter hamilton s books he s very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster than light society plausible but as with a lot of these hard science libertarian sf authors he badly needs an editor i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel pandora s star he also has far too many main characters who \( despite 800 pages \) never seem to come alive they all speak with essentially the same voice and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped 60s era hippies come on does anyone seriously say dude in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young \( or rejuvenated \) women hamilton s treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best on the one hand the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed represented and believable on the other hand the dynamics of the relationship between old timers and first lifers is unsatisfactory in four centuries for example no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty perhaps the commonwealth s continual expansion is the safety valve but even here the government \( controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties \) controls it another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn t change i mean the characters of a novel \( almost by definition \) are dynamic go get em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime the aliens are ok the problem with them \( and this is true of nearly every sf story \) is that they tend to be one dimensional they re all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up \( this is a problem in fantasy stories too \) on the plus side i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien deus ex machina ozzie s adventures in wonderland \( i e the silfen paths \) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn t really help anyone defeat the primes overall if you started with pandora s star you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained if you haven t started down this silfen path i recommend alistair reynolds tony daniel or iain banks they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date,negative

one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot s unfurtunate preducices but how come you don t say something like that about o henry we can t just stop reading authers because you we don t like their views someone calls hemingway looking forward if that s looking forward i de rather look backward hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past but towards what we have made out of the present in name of progress we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous the first draft according to one of eliot s biographers was absolutly a expression of relavtism one critic accused him being a nihilist on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe so it doesn t have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism we could use more of that yet what he doesn t right he evoces through mode and tone giving us truly one of the best poems of this or any other century,positive

i enjoy reading sports fiction with my 10 year old son the descriptions of this book suggested it addressed important themes which transcended basketball however as i read the book i found the treatment of those themes quite superficial in addition the book was bawdy while it may accurately reflect locker room mentality many readers may not find that mentality entertaining it is not an appropriate book for children,negative

i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also this book is filled with suspense from page one the book never drags in my opinion this book though is not for the faint of heart if you don t enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter but if you don t mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes the ending is by far the most suspenseful part i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn t i can t choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end keep up the good work king,positive
my boy ejd is back and so am i keeping it real i took an eric jerome dickey hiatus for years he held a special spot on my shelf as my favorite author hands down then it happened his books just weren t doing it for me anymore call in change call it growth falling off call it whatever but i wasn t feeling it drive me crazy drove me crazy and i couldn t finish it unheard of for me chasing destiny came but i let her run right past me however the title of his new release piqued my interest so i decided to give it a shot and i am glad i did death is life gideon is a freelance hit man in the seedy underbelly of death for hire gideon is know as a man of talent and business a profitable business he has a goal that he is trying to reach and with this acceptance of his most recent job he just may obtain it this job could put him over the edge financially and literally has the hunter become the hunted sleeping with strangers is a smartly written great reading drama thriller that showcases dickey s talent he blended success style and heartlessness then he added some ruthlessness deceit and trickery let s not forget murder mayhem and steamy sex scenes my hiatus is officially over i enjoyed sws now i m at the door looking out the peephole waiting on the sequel to arrive,positive
i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem \( except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries \) writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust mr crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday mr crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people s thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet,negative

i will not try to say that i asserted the painstaking analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of heidegger more than that i have no interest in doing so it is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being \( existence \) and my reading didn t lead me to any other conclusions so as i said i have no interest in reading this a second time further deeper or slower being and time is chock full of invented terminology to the extent that michael inwood was able to profit from his publication of a heidegger dictionary whatever you might think the word world means for instance is not what heidegger means and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so this is the case with his entire vocabulary if there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by heidegger i would not bring this up as a crticism beyond the unventilated severely sober and utterly uninspiring character of being in time i also call attention to the futility of it s project if heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him that there is no question of being why is the question of being so problematic because it is unanswerable maybe or if it is answerable we re not in any position to answer it being implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn t make sense and if you posit an idea that is so concrete so constant you can t just bend it to make it fit reality you ve already betrayed your questioning truth including the truth of being is a local phenomenon truth is not always and forever true it s true when it s true but heidegger wanted an everlasting truth a dogmatic anthropology worse than the general uselessness of his project and the toxic dregs left in his wake heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought provoking way,negative
this book should get 0 stars speaking as an artist myself the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics etc to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse admittedly i could not even finish this book after reading for the nth time a line of shaky circumstantial evidence like all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw but there are no correction marks therefore optics must have been used i could not even stand to keep reading on the contrary all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction that is just one example the book is filled with flaky examples such as those hockney claiming this is too good to have been done without optics or this was too difficult to have been done without optics and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art if that is indeed what he thinks and modern artists must remember this nowadays the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists for many reasons superior art education is very hard to find and there are many distractions in the modern world \( tv computers having to hold a day job lack of patrons etc \) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did therefore most will never attain the skill of the old masters but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology some of the other examples used as evidence refer to odd proportion perspective etc in otherwise masterful work i am surprised that this author \( and those readers who are artists \) apparently does not realize that throughout history great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism even nowadays photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists because after all we are artists not cameras the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality not to copy it therefore many inconsistencies in proportion perspective etc evident in old masters work are not oddities or mistakes but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition all that being said i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of trickery or technology of some sort instead an art student should be encouraged to build skill discipline and self reliance because that is the true secret of the great masters,negative
homesick my own story by jean fritz is a story about an american girl who grows up in china she spends a good part of her life wishing she could be in america where she belongs when she s not doing that she s corresponding with her grandmother trying to make friends with some young chinese children and learning british culture in school as you can see jean fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up however this story is an autobiography and is in almost no way fictional jean fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway though jean fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane ticket her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot or even understand the full story the autobiography is punctuated by emotions all in all this is a fine educational history text but is not in my opinion a fitting storybook,negative

this book is a personal re examination of food what we eat and why we eat it in this book prentice examines food customs and traditions searching for their physiological and environmental rationale her primary observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied to the seasons and thus the continual year round availability of our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge about what is good for us and what isn t in recognition of the essential seasonality of foods prentice organizes this book into the thirteen moons that make up the year from the famine moon to the sap moon from the egg moon to the corn moon from the blood moon to the wolf moon each chapter describes the ecology that led to the association between a particular food item and a specific time of the year in the chapters prentice discusses the nutritional contributions of the featured food items and how her relationship with that food has changed over the years for example she explains how she used to avoid milk and other dairy products but now relishes them as a gift of love from mother earth each chapter also includes recipes of the season ranging from exotic dishes of non western food cultures like cardamom and jaggery pudding to simple directions for lost arts such as rendering pork or making homemade yogurt and sauerkraut prentice was once a strict vegan who for health reasons eventually found herself drawn to a diet which includes animal products but not the products of industrial agriculture there is much that vegetarians and vegans would not like in prentice s essays since she explains how her 10 years of vegetarianism were not healthy for her having had the same experience myself after being a vegetarian for 20 years i can appreciate the wisdom in what she writes while vegetarian diets work well for some they are not appropriate for everybody but at the same time diets that include the consumption of industrially produced and processed animal products do nobody any good we need to be willing to recognize our relation and responsibilities to the animals that we consume i first heard of this book when i attended a vermont localvore potluck at which prentice was the invited guest chef i was deeply offended then at her attitude when she announced she was going to make a salad using a recipe from her book but lamented the lack of local artichokes or olive oil how could such a person be associated with local cooking i wondered if she doesn t even have the sense to find out what the best local ingredients are and celebrate them instead of parading the products of another region in front of us i figured that a seasonal local cookbook written by a national author would be a worthless concept fortunately that s not what this book attempts instead the book is much more about rediscovering our connection to food than about specific local recipes although she has become famous for leading the concept of eating foods only from one s local region what she urges here is really an appreciation for the products of small farms thus instead of simply cheering on local food prentice argues in this book that our industrial agriculture system has torn us away from one of the most essential of human traits our relationship to the food that nourishes us instead of following diets of avoidance prentice advocates recognizing the meaning that each item of food brings to our lives and using food to re establish our connection to the land indeed the only foods that prentice avoids are those heavily processed products of industrial agriculture refined sugar white flour and pre packaged extruded junk although the book contains a few recipes it is not a cookbook but rather a wake up call our poor diet is at least partly a physical manifestation of a spiritual decay together with some suggestions of how we can begin the journey back to healthy eating,positive

elaine pagels is a wonderful writer her explanation into early christianity is wonderful it is definitely worth the time to read this she delves into the politics of the early church the passion the resurrection as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking too often we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were read this,positive
those who condemn this book for not being a long boring list of name origins and meanings or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today s children are missing the point baby names now is a fun readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s including famous namesakes \( saints popes presidents royalty music and movie stars \) and what some celebrities have named their children it s also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style for example lisa amy susan and dawn were very popular for babies born in the 60s \( and thus my classmates \) but are rarely used today the book s major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire not just the first names at one point it reads harrison ford is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison s popularity excuse me ever hear of the beatles the entries for the name jordan don t mention michael jordan certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area the entry for jackson doesn t mention michael janet or samuel l the entry for landon doesn t mention michael the entries for cassidy don t mention david and shaun so popular in the 70s when many of today s moms were growing up the entry for lucas do i have to say it fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children and come on how can you mention the name wayne without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne still this is a lot of fun and i give the authors credit for recognizing that althea is from a grateful dead song i look forward to the next edition,positive
with someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome why dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of shakespeare s most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me it s not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it literally if you are looking to learn the solid fundementals of chemistry you should pass this one by and go with something like wiley s chemistry concepts and problems in which you begin learning immediately in a simple straightforward manner for anyone to suggest that a book like this should be part of any school s curriculum is just absurd,negative
i should first confess my bias i have often been tickled and sometimes awed by mortimer s way with english prose for 20 years so in picking up this book i had the high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or beloved teacher no disappointment even if some of these essays are slightly less effervescent than others all are at least wonderful and several are both brilliant and touching mortimer has given us a collection of short essays conversational and often wryly funny which he intends as a kind of spiritual bequeathal to his family and other heirs the chapters range across a broad range of subjects some perhaps outwardly frivolous like the cooking of eggs but in the main mortimer touches on matters of great substance the nature of beauty how to be happy surprising ways in which our world has managed to be unjust places and times for sex how to dine sociably the love of children faith and reason the terrors of the writer facing blank paper and many more i found these essays to be wise and absolutely delicious i suspect that readers who have enjoyed rumpole or mortimer s other biographical essays like summer of a doormouse or clinging to the wreckage will be quite pleased with these sketches mortimer may sadly be nearing the end of his life but at present he seems to be on a literary tear i for one wish him many more prolific years,positive
i ran into this book accidentally while doing some research instead of glancing through it i ended up reading the whole book i just couldn t put it off content wise the book doesn t bring me many light bumb moments however i find it extremely well written rhetorically while the book is easy to read it is literarily graceful i d suggest everyone to read it just to enjoy the beauty of language,positive

this is an excellent fascinating and insightful read dr guarneri knows her stuff and has writen this book well she wrote it because obviously we need to think about nutrition cholesterol and excercise but there are deeper issues too like peoples emotions she believes that heart problems can be caused by the stress s in our lives and our emotions we could litterally die of a broken heart emotional events can weaken heart muscles you produce stress hormones when you are upset which raise blood sugars and blood pressure etc which ultimately weaken or can destroy the heart she talks about this in the book and on the flip side talks about happy people too and how positive emotions and feelings do good for our hearts when we are happy our hearts beat in a coherent rythym she says we have to look at our hearts in various ways we need to look at it as a pump to keep us alive but to also look at the emotional heart the mental heart and the spiritual heart in order to keep us healthy i believe she knows her stuff and she wrote this well and has made it totally interesting and it s looking at our hearts in a different way from other books on the same subject if you have a healthy and happy outlook on life you will also have a happy and healthy heart,positive

i was interested in dante s thoughts on hell religion and the afterlife as taught by the catholic church at the time of its writing what i got was a detailed political history of medieval italy this book is great for the first few chapters but then it becomes a repetitive saga synopsis of the each chapter of the inferno go to next layer of hell describe in 20 words or less the torture found there make fun of some political opponents catholic church officials and so forth prepare for further descent in my opinion this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell canto three pretty much has it right leave all hope ye that enter,negative
at least this author mentions the mockery strategy martha mdiddy tried to use to fog the public the real issue of whether martha mdiddy committed the crimes and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question did martha stewart lie demonstrates some complacency is it this complacency martha mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote is it the greyness of white collar crime that martha mdiddy was trying to play on is society the ultimate judge about a person s guilt or innocence if so what has martha mdiddy been judged be thoughtful shaw,negative

the unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes dan brown look like borges in comparison naming characters guard one just shows you don t even try to care the plot is so hair brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache i just learned to my horror that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times i d have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise but it s been ruined forever by this somewhere baby jesus is crying,negative

i actually know where trieste was before i read this book unfortunately i have never visited the city i wanted to read this travel book about this famous city but after a few chapters i wondered where the book was going to after the final chapter i still do not know what the author s intentions was with this book perhaps i don t read too many travel books obviously the city means a lot to the author but she did not express it clearly in her writing i was scratching my head at the end and wondering what i read i learned a little about the city but not in relation to the amount of time i spent reading this short book the city of james joyce and maximillian the imperial port of the austo hungarian empire the meeting point of slav german and latin empires one of the ending points of the iron curtain this city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader i am sure the author s other books are good her last one was not the greatest,negative

i read this book on a suggestion from a friend before i read reviving ophelia because she wanted to see if i would be as dissapointed with it as she was i was more so while there are some outstanding essays in this collection the bias of the editor clearly stands out there is no one for the outcasts to relate to there was no musician nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion there were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had the sections are poorly named and divided all in all it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original some girls it may make feel less alone but for me it only accentuated the differences definately take out from the library before you buy it,negative
it is almost like dream comes true when i saw the revised new second edition out at the bookstore the imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor but has graciously added new updated materials in synthesis you may see it as an equivalent to jerry march s advanced organic chemistry but a whole different approach the sections on oxidations reductions and organoboranes are excellent since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like nicholaou s classics in total synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry,positive
just wanted to quickly say i haven t finished it yet i am only on page 20 but already this book seems very overrated the author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views instead he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate conclusive authority on spirituality and it s very aloof and actually not an enlightened approach at all i ve just started the chapter on karma and it s really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people s opinions clothed as quasi originality it looks like i m going to continue reading with a very cautious vetting attitude toward the text the fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness and how easily authors such as zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears hey that s the material world for you,negative
our attention is the most precious resource we have says shenk well i m not sure everyone would agree but this is the way he would like to slice the whole matter of information technology the media etc etc and that s fine shenk s standpoint is amazingly isolated and will make sense only to an elite ensconced in the same high fallutin mix of punditry technology leisure time he is information overload or data smog as the author terms it is certainly a relevant and important area to explore but shenk in is privileged world really can t nail down what might be so detrimental about it his examples illustrate just how removed his is from the vast majority of american society minute by minute news reports diluting the quality of info and the ability to sort it not feeling so apt to respond to your friends email because you get too much the end of patience as he represents it in the end of patience data smog really ain t no big woop it s just some tacks on the erogomic seats of a pampered minority into which shenk seems to fit where s the politics i wonder how does this trivia fit into the lives of middle americans or working people to the point shenk might benefit from a step or two away from his computer rubbing shoulders with the common folk might hip him to serious problems like acne or monday night football,negative
i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i couldn t wait to begin this one the hero is a junior varsity tom joad but ok i was game the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable baddies and goodies they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on then when we got to the jersey shore i found out that in 1942 with america fighting for it s life against fascism and losing our hero knew why all the servicemen were bullies \( a drafted station employee \) or morons \( the coast guard beach patrol \) the 4f hero was the real mccoy however although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn t kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems the murder of 10s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi ussr pact probably and i say probably didn t elude our observant literary genius he was also a 1975 era feminist all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support most big businessmen probably wearing spats and silk high hats were the bad guys needless to say i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book i couldn t finish it and it s a point of honor for me to finish all books then in the bio it all became clear the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado i m still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated quaker schoolmarm expression that said somebody somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease,negative

this classic chronicle of presidential campaigns from the get go to contemporary times has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride or as a reference source reading this in the wake of monicagate and the florida recount it s instructive to read the history of grover cleveland who seems to have features of both past democratic candidates like clinton he had his scandals fathering an illegitimate child like gore his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost in a hotly contested knife edge electoral college tally,positive

i was rather disappointed in mr peterson s work he dwells much too long on trying to convince us of the problem nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload even after wading through the numbers and graphs i am still skeptical of his conclusions and would caution readers to do further research certainly the baby boomers are an aging bulge in the population of the us and will create some challenges however the author fails to mention the echo boom \( baby boomer s children which are equal in number \) and he glosses over the impact of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every year both of these facts will soften the impact of the gray doom that mr peterson tries to create i just don t anticipate the tremendous problem of which he tries to make us aware but i did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth control will have on our future another disappointment was very little discussion of aging trends and buying habits despite these shortcomings i enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and the impact of aging populations,negative
since i received this book i have been carting it around using it for reference ever since i wish that i had been introduced to this book sooner in my college career it sets a good foundation for the basics it is also good for sparking ideas if you are stuck robin williams also writes well making it a fun easy read \( like all her books \) i highly recommend this title,positive

i recently re read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival s performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder drawn from sir thomas north s 1579 english version of plutarch s lives william shakespeare \( 1552 1616 \) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career around 1607 and published it in the first folio in 1623 it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers roman military leader marc antony and the captivating queen of egypt \( and former mistress of julius caesar \) cleopatra when his wife fulvia unexpectedly dies antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister octavia of course this news enrages passionate cleopatra she vents her anger on the messenger but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty however antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra s arms abandoning his new wife in athens this leads to war when octavius declares war on egypt after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide which prompts antony to wound himself mortally antony dies in his lover s arms and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar \( octavius \) the heart broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs in the end antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next g merritt,positive
i was so disappointed in this book i don t find a closeness to god in the pages instead it seems intellectual it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek and though the author s prayers are included too i feel the same about them i expected more from richard j foster,negative
having read most of grisham s books i ve saved a few of his best for last while it wasn t a 5 star book like i d hoped it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one having saw the movie years ago i had a good idea of what the book was about two supreme court justices are killed a law school student along with many other people become curious and try to figure out who dun it only she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head and when the wrong people find out she s on the run for her life i enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast paced and had a lot of detail so much detail and characters i had a bit of a struggle to keep up of course it was suspenseful and the characters especially of darby the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth good read,positive

i m a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven but practices eclectically within my private practice i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian purportedly wicca s charm was written by an impartial writer immediately you realize that this isn t true catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders arguments instead i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched she relies on the writings of margot adler carol christ starhawk and phyllis curott \( with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton \) to draw many of her conclusions yet missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars merlin stone raymond buckland isaac bonewits patricia crowley and the matthews to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism s base of knowledge too often sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive in another case she bases her thesis that women s spirituality \( e g goddess worship \) is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9 11 sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind a fair request but as you re reading closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul,negative

first off i d like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i ve ever read jedi search being the first i actually liked the first book it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read however this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it \( be warned this may contain a few spoilers \) thusly how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions it reminds me of a little britain sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space i don t mind the story being 20 odd pages shorter if it comes to the point for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to ground the story by constantly relating to the star wars films for example when wedge and the scientist go to that forest resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there he says something along the lines of i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca little did i know the brush i had with history there gahhhhhhh why how did he know it didn t need it bangs head on desk he does this throughout the two books i ve read so far how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without proving that it s true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films then there s admiral daala made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking so what is she doing in this she s reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing it s only the end of the second book and she s down to 1 star destroyer she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens \( i e the rebellion win \) he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea that of having a jedi academy \( the point of the trilogy \) there s so much that could have been done here new and original training for the jedi but no he has the jedi go two by two into the forest \( holding hands \) to sense things it s meant to be a sci fi series something could have been done to make this so much better i was incensed to find that luke was actually made boring in this book part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown it all started very promisingly in the first book having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever \( cool i thought \) it got to the stage where i d dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull the other trainee jedi needed serious character development \( they were 1 dimensional \) entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn t good enough as other reviewers have said one of his students goes rogue somehow gains the knowledge of building a super lightsabre \( great idea btw we need more of that \) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters and luke just meditates about it grr okay all that being said it was okay and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book \( it s like a car accident you ve just got to look \),negative
a well crafted comprehensive look at the role of islam in turkey the book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that turkey has experienced since the 1980s specifically the author mentions the role of opportunity spaces in the evolution of islamic movements and ideas as a result of economic and political liberalization i think anyone who is interested in turkey islamic movements and the relationship between islam and modernity would get a great deal out of this book,positive

this is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860 s narrated by a civil war deserter within the first few pages our hero enlists pilfers letters off battlefield corpses deserts is injured in nyc draft riots ends up in new bedford ma and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going the book was downhill from there page after page described ice and the crew s interminable struggles to get through getting through the book was nearly as interminable the reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him or really understand him at all thus his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles there are elements of fantasy in the book not enough to make it a fantasy but enough to steer a reader off course the scientist on the mission is after a warm garden of eden in the middle of the arctic he is mad or it s fantasy it is hard to know until the end there is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands \( the most likeable character in the book \) describes how he got his third hand from that yarn comes the title rope eater the title really has nothing to do with the book other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain besides the tedious turning of the plot the characters lack any development only the three handed man and the captain both tangential characters had any depth whatsoever this book seemed to be an attempt at adventure but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension it never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters mentally and physically it just happened although the reader knew the characters must be suffering it never came through the over writing as one might expect the crew s mission to find the warm garden of eden in the arctic was pointless so was this book it was a disappointment,negative
i must say i enjoyed the book but the ending was so sudden with so many things left hanging that i was disappointed i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up how did manderly catch fire what did they do when they got to the burning house and how did they pick up their lives all we had at the ending was ashes also the narrator who never gives her name was sometimes very odd hiding behind doors in her own home sneaking food hiding behind chairs the book is worth reading but i wish that instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea du maurier had written a better ending,negative

i am at the mid point of the book and will likely post another review when i am done the authors give the history and motivation and design decisions behind hla they also give many good examples allow you to get a really good feel for the important concepts of hla by running an actual federation one thing i will be looking for is the impact of the architecture on simulation performance scalability in practice \( as opposed to in theory \) and how is hla likely to evolve over the next couple decades i don t know yet whether the book is enough for you to create your first federation if you really have no background at all in simulation you will still get a lot out of the first couple of chapters plus the many references to articles written on the subject but don t expect to find the other chapters easy using my background in simulation systems i can say that hla seems to have been very well thought out based on real life simulation systems and is therefore not trivial but that s what makes it interesting and the book so far lives up to that,positive
practical sage advice from stanley not as good as his follow up the millionaire mind this book is somewhat pedantic it also suffers from the fact it s extremely dry the author s writing is much more engaging in his followup and that s a much faster read in addition to offering some practical tips the millionaire next door also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry s money secrets a book called maybe life s just not that into you and something from andy borowitz the name of which escapes me if you have to choose between the millionaire next door and the millionaire mind go with the latter,positive
this book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis etc however i don t want to live with ra i want to recover from it as such this book offers no help in this regard it tells me about drugs that i can take and splints that i can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled but offers me no hope of recovery in contrast the book conquering arthritis by barbara allan is the well researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease to get their life back and succeeded i m well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book now that s a book well worth spending your money on,negative
i am a fan of tanya huff and the series of books with henry and victoria but this one is not it while henry is there he is such a minor character the main character is tony foster a homosexual street kid who tanya should have left on the street i was totally bored and read the book through because i was hoping it would get better then i was happy when it was over the plot idea was great but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more i was expecting henry to be a major player like he was with victoria but no he is relegated to tony s homosexual vampire lover who helps tony out disappointing dull i won t read the rest of this series the tony foster series hey tanya how about a series of henry fitzroy i would read that,negative
the theory behind this important collection of essays is that the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms these essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well each essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and thirteenth century europe at issue in each are the questions of what or who held the power to command or punish and how that power was obtained kept and manifested this is a truly enlightening book of particular interest are the essays on holding power over the truth as well as those dealing the formation of the nobility into a self consciously chivalric warrior class however all the essays are intelligent and useful explorations into the very nature and meaning of power ultimately this book must be considered essential for any serious student of history casual or academic,positive
this was the first vi warshawski book i ever read and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more i think paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into vi s world which is rich with unique characters vi comes across as individualistic and principled and i like how paretsky resisted clich temptation on several counts the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book and there is no obligatory sex scene not that sex scenes don t have their places but i just hate it when i m reading along and i can almost hear the agent say okay author you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book in this story vi is all business which is a delightful change of pace,positive
it took two people to write this book i was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40 something reader but this book really was a waste of my time you can see the ending a mile away for one but that didn t really bother me it was the writing the main character suffers from a syndrome that s unfortunately common to chick lit heroines which is to speak in an overly quippy aren t i clever with my snappy dialog way nearly every one of her sentences included a quip joke \( or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke \) real people just don t talk that way and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her by the way my copy had the first chapter of these authors next book attached at the end and they ve basically created the same two main characters the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend i won t bother with it,negative

it s a bad idea to create a character driven sci fi when your characters are this annoying the majority of children of the mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about the characters are so one dimensional and predictable that you already know what they ll say before they say it peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person novinha is as crazy and hard headed as she s been for the last two books and ender spouts off a bunch of trite up with people garbage every chance he gets somehow card even managed to make jane more irritating than my ex girlfriend during pms the only decent characters in this book are miro and wang mu and they aren t nearly enough to save the story i admit it i only made it a little over half way through children of the mind i couldn t take the dialogue anymore that s not to mention the ridiculous plot which centers on two children warping around the universe engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of japanese and polynesian culture in an attempt to avert a war between species if you re that curious to learn how the ender quartet concludes do what i should ve done from the beginning find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage,negative

this book has major shortcomings stein s obsession with character over plot for one \( martin amis said i used to sneer at plot until i wrote a novel that had one titled night train it was hard and i used stay awake at night hoping i wasn t leaving any holes \) another being his obsession with show don t tell \( gabriel garcia marquez s novel love in the time of cholera is probably the greatest novel of the 1980 s and it s almost entirely tell and very little show \) and the passages stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing \( a taxi disengorging its passengers is categorically bad writing \) and stein admits he rejected frederick forythe s the day of the jackal i wouldn t read a book by dick rowe about how to make it in the music business \( rowe famously rejected the beatles from decca records \) stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline but then rowe was going by just a demo tape better writing books are out there,negative
one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way those two books were edge of your seat reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action doesn t start until about halfway or more into the book and even then the cliched writing and deification of balf s subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan i would not recommend this book,negative
with relations between the west and the islamic world worsening rapidly a better understanding of islam and its roots is badly needed in the west one major barrier between understanding islamic culture is the key sacred text the q uran has been little studied in the west and until recently good translations were unavailable many qurans were translated into the same sort of english as the king james bible and not a glint of the quran s revevered poetic beauty was reflected in such translations thankfully better translations in modern english are being made by leading islamic scholars who have a more sensitive ear to the poetry of the quran as well as a better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has for believing muslims like all great works of literature especially a poetic one like the quran its power and beauty can only be appreciated in its original language this is why muslims often say the quran is untranslateable but when one hears a verse of the quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of arabic the beauty \( while unfortunately not fully understandable \) does start to become apparent but even in translation when read carefully the quran still has great beauty from a literary viewpoint the most beautiful part of the quran in my view is the light surah which compares god to a light whose glory fills the entire cosmos this surah has been a favourite with sufis islamic theologians like al ghazzali and also muslim philosophers as well while the quran does contain descriptions of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the westerner it is important to study this work with patience and try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented jumble of poems it is in this sense the deep underlying unity of the quran and its theology \( which reflects the unity of allah the divinity in islam \) becomes apparent especially in the names of god a good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming indispensible in a world where islam is becoming more important to understand from a global perspective,positive

addressing as it does issues of cognition language usage and acquisition evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time it is very readable for the most part although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going more illustrations would have helped here there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage pinker s lively humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting then list a few more then add i could not resist some more and so on i sometimes wished he would just get on with it a major problem with his nativist approach which other reviewers have commented on is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book linguists have been busy recording them in the field the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter where he argues that you and i and you and me are equally correct in all circumstances because the pronoun is free to have any case it wants but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about if between you and i sounds instinctively wrong to me and between you and me sounds instinctively wrong to someone else does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene i doubt it the title itself is problematic instinct is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense early in the book pinker admits as much but determines to use the word anyway a use that owes more to marketing than to science still this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available if you are new to linguistics start here rather than with chomsky but please go on to read geoffrey sampson s work perhaps starting with his website to get an alternative view as with most academic disputes the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle since chomsky s early work the nativists have toned down their claims considerably while their opponents have made concessions on page 34 of this book pinker says no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene but the search is on more than a decade later the search is still on good luck with that,positive
this commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of romans romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the bible and john stoot does a good job of unpacking it the book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the scriptures it is probably not considered a highly scholarly work but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either,positive

another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species or perhaps a more apt ocean related metaphor would be comparing malkin s work to that of the brainless bivalves that cluster around sewer outflows or the mindless jellyfish who flow with the ocean currents but like the ocean neo cons writings should be taken with more than a grain of salt by the way the reviewer below who wants someone named mccracken reported to amazon i m sure you can take it instead why don t you campaign for a zero star feature for reviews or perhaps a fact checking service for publishers of political vitriol like this work of fiction i sure hope no public money has been spent on stuff like this,negative
murky in his book 1984 orwell described a contrived language he called newspeak designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible but before orwell there were russell and whitehead who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence as whitehead wrote in his foreword to quine s ph d dissertation titled a system of logic logic shapes metaphysical thought thus in his on universals quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as entities and he co authored with goodman steps toward a constructive nominalism a nominalist manifesto in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or platonists depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities i believe that anyone who says that universals are referenced or who uses the phrase abstract entities fully deserves to be labeled a platonist but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak in the search inside this book screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting \( p 20 \) that realists say universals are shared entities and are referents of predicates i ask loux what happened to signification the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense \( i e signification \) as well as denotation \( i e reference \) in the functional \( i e predicate \) calculus i ask loux what happened to supposition which distinguishes reference from signification in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions \( i e significations \) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization \( i e reference \) and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects i ask loux since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric i see murky writing muddled loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine the pragmatic realist who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing ontological relativity started as an analogy quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton s absolute time and he rejected lorentz s making relativistic time apparent time likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory s positing of duality and indeterminacy today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition nonlocality and calabi yau spaces in eleven dimensions quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs realism is a natural primordial irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity anti realism in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change i do not find this book contemporary loux s realism anti realism locution is a false dichotomy i see muddled thinking marginalized while a student i found notre dame s philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site thomas j hicke,negative
the advice in this book is solid and appropriate for most kids however the writer s attitude is judgmental if you are buying this book it s probably because your child s eating has not gone as smoothly as you d like for most of us a lot of our parental self esteem is wrapped up in this issue so it just makes no sense to act as if it s usually the parent s fault why alienate and beat up your target audience plus while i m sure that some parents contribute to kids eating issues plenty of kids are just born more sensitive if you can read between the lines and get to the take home message without letting her attitude get to you more power to you otherwise go elsewhere,negative
from a sociological perspective hustlers beats and others serves what it set out to do explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time however with the recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society many of his observations and conclusions are dated if not false te book just goes to many places crime pornography etc and fails what it set out to originally acomplish furthermore i find it quite unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards is this not a sociological perspective or an historical editorial as a college student and a sociology major the author fails to win my support from his argument all in all quite disapointing as i found it at my local bookstore and the cover looked interesting i was left with a feeling of disappointment when i finished this book as it completely crushed many of the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture of billiards stick with the sociology cut the editoria,negative
i am sorry to say that i thoroughly disliked of human bondage i know it is on every must read list for fiction \( which is why i decided to read it \) however i just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature not only did i find it dull but i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character s perception of women i m not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways yellow teethed sallow skin dirty hands tear stained over powdered face it goes on and on i wondered if the author was uncomfortable women i looked online for some information about maugham to my surprise i found out that maugham was bisexual he did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men in no way can i say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book but in some way it answered my question or concern instead of this book i d recommend the following classics beautiful and damned by f scott fitzgerald madame bovary by flaubert at least in these books maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional good or bad,negative

paul ehrlich may understand butterflies more than most of us do but he definitely does not understand how the real world in general and the human society in particular works he just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells to think realistically about the world this book starts with the bold statement that he had understood the population explosion for quite some time nevertheless the whole book proves that it s not the case all his reasoning is based on the worst possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable short term trend his assumptions therefore include the intelligent assumption that there won t ever be any technological progress in the future the climate will evolve in the worst possible way and so forth it s not surprising that he predicted that there would be mass starvation in the u s in the 1980s and even when this was shown to be complete nonsense he repeated the same prediction for the 1990s why does he and people like him continue to produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by the actual course of history it s because of their religion maybe they don t call it a religion but it is a religion nevertheless jehovah s witnesses typically believe that there is going to be a judgement day because it did not occur in 1918 and other years for which it was predicted they are a bit more careful and vague in their predictions nowadays malthus had done very similar errors as ehrlich but you may think that in the 20th century people could know more than malthus knew many years ago but ehrlich does not know more in some sense even karl marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic predictions marx predicted that something wrong would occur with capitalism as such and it would be globally replaced by communism \( this is what i call a truly catastrophic prediction \) marx was wrong of course because he completely misunderstood the magic power of the society and of the market to improve things that need to be improved and its ability to self regulate and accomodate to new conditions ehrlich is repeating all errors of marx and many other errors too but other people who have a different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be approaching a judgement day can t learn from jehovah s witnesses mistakes of course that paul ehrlich s reasoning has nothing to do with rational approach to important questions \( bjorn lomborg may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar questions namely these speculative questions about the long term food problems rationally \) ehrlich confuses the total amount of food available today and the total production of food he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can increase much like the population or even more he does not understand that the growth of the population in the developed world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed children and so forth he just does not understand the invisible hand of free markets and the visible hand of scientific and technologica progress and the power of human decisions his reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he simply tried to make similar predictions about the past but it was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the future his goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress many people who are not exactly smart the similarity between ehrlich s predictions of mass starvation and the recent predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a superficial coincidence find the book boiling point by ross gelbspan at this website one of the silly recent books about the climate change disasters that expect us among the 15 mostly positive reviews of the book you will also find a 5 star review by paul ehrlich of stanford himself the global warming alarmists continue with the traditions of paul ehrlich it is still the same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things the universe and human stupidity and i am not sure about the universe,negative
this is the best invertebrate zoology textbook on the market perhaps the best ever written the authors are not content to merely present in fine detail the classification anatomy physiology behavior and ecology of invertebrates they present alternative interpretations and controversial opinions where these topics are concerned in that way invertebrate zoology comes alive as an active important and relevant field of study for understanding the ecology and evolutionary relationships of these organisms in a global setting i highly recommend this book for a course of study or as a reference for earth science instructors who wish to solidify and deepend their knowledge and understanding of invertebrates,positive

these mysteries are cozy and interesting and good they are perfect i could not ask for a better mystery not only is the setting and atmosphere cozy but the clues story line and pacing are perfect this author definitely has talent the clues are perfectly and cleverly crafted and lead to the mystery solving and the characters you feel like you know them i love this small town and all the characters not just the main characters but the other characters have purpose and meaning in this book hannah opened up a cookie shop with the encouragement of her sister andrea hannah finds the milk truck delivery driver dead in his truck she is determined to find out why he was murdered i also loved the cookies and coffee and cold weather and i enjoyed the sisters relationship,positive
i enjoyed the parts regarding the s s valiant but the later part of the book simply didn t work for me except for picard who we of course know quite well from the series the other characters were flat and uninteresting we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy of the week boring the whole adversarial situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard,negative

i wish i could give this book four and a half stars instead of four i can t quite justify five stars in my mind two of the stories were definitely good the first masked riders by parhelion and the third ricochet by ba tortuga i enjoyed both but was not particularly snowed by the intensity of the conflict plot line or the main characters and their relationships not so the second story hung up by cat kane was a powerful intense and moving story about two delightful yet flawed characters who had secrets that tore their relationship up until they were able to work their ways \( separately \) around the issues that story deserved a five stars plus rating and i wish kane would turn it into a full length novel and develop the characters and their backgrounds more this book is an excellent read both for the plot line and the erotic substance enjoy,positive
i love heinlein i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction i find that his plots and ideas are inventive even this story was inventive in many ways like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters however i found this book as a whole to be very boring much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters the main characters of each section of the book aren t fully realized at all i wouldn t recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really really bored,negative

has there ever been anyone like richard nixon for sheer resiliency he stands alone in american history no one won bigger than richard nixon and no one lost bigger than richard nixon and then won again and then lost and won again he just kept punching and planning and working to eventually become one of the dominant figures of the 20th century the author of 9 books 8 of them best sellers this is his first and covers six major crises of his political life to 1962 this is serious history but so well written that it reads like an exciting novel in it you can see the raw steel of the man emerging through his discipline beginnig with his first crisis as a 35 year old freshman congressman the prosecution of alger hiss the darling of east coast liberals and the state department as a soviet spy the other crises have been well described by other reviewers but all were thrilling examples of courage \( backed by preparation \) under fire highly experienced washington veteran david gergen who worked closely with four presidents in his excellent book eyewitness to history described richard nixon as the toughest man i ever knew in this book you can see why interestingly his overwhelming love of country shines through as well for example the 1960 election was unbelievably close a swing of only 11 000 votes properly distributed and the election results would have been reversed and there was verifiable vote fraud by the democrats especially in texas and illinois nixon was repeatedly urged to demand an investigation and recount he refused first it would have greatly delayed the transference of responsiblity to a new administration but secondly as he wrote then too the bitterness that would be engendered by such a maneuver on my part would in my opinion have done incalculable and lasting damage throughout the country there speaks a patriot and a man also recommnended nixon in winter by monica crowley,positive
i ve been following the alex cross series from its beginning and after reading cat mouse i m wondering if patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more cross books written subsequently to this one i can only hope that the series gets better my complains are similar to those of other reviewers 1 i m getting sick of the perfection of alex cross the man s a saintly father saintly grandson saintly lover saintly charity worker and saintly detective these traits hooked the reader and made cross an intriguing character but he s fast becoming too one dimensional 2 the cross sampson relationship as if we weren t sick enough of this already every few chapters we re reminded of the man crush cross and sampson have on each other sampson is so perfect in cross s eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time sampson enters a scene 3 the cross christine johnson relationship moves way too fast one moment christine is still mourning the loss of her husband \( who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in jack jill \) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date and the next she and cross are madly in love no development whatsoever no line from point a to point b 4 i m not sure patterson could have written the dialogue between cross and his children any more unrealistically aren t these 7 and 9 year old children he has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with sampson or kyle craig 5 the entire novel is a series of pseudo climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field the soneji resolution was anti climactic at best and the mr smith conclusion was unfulfilling,negative
as a certified information systems security professional i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here and i m at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle an integrated approach to security in the organization the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques it doesn t seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half hearted integration,negative

once again larry mcmurtry delivers the goods in this tale of the old west we are introduced to calamity jane who spends a lot of time writing letters to her daughter by the light of a campfire calamity jane joins a western touring company and the sea voyage to america is particularly memorable there is also another character worth mentioning namely a native american called no ears who views the world in terms of deep philosophical thought towards the end of the book we see calamity jane lamenting her lost youth and sadly reflects on the glory days of the old west that she was once a part of larry mcmurtry has writen a fine novel with a real believable female character which is something most writers in this genre are unable to accomplish another wondrous tale from a master of his craft,positive
a favourite writer goes to prison keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read then upon his release writes the worst book of his career the concept of the book is good as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9 11 tragedy the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9 11 grounding of air traffic the idea that new yorkers wouldn t know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable while there is a direct highway to montreal archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive once at the border the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly doesn t know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero the guard then remarks that he will meet a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us canadian border crossings with multi lane checkpoints 24 7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness dan cormie,negative

the late carl sagan was one of the most popular influential and successful interpreters of astronomy to the american public in 1973 he published the cosmic connection he offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science inspiring a generation of scientists and non specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general and astronomy in particular now cambridge university press has reissued a new edition of sagan s influential book enhanced with freeman dyson s commentary on sagan s vision and on the importance of the cosmic connection ann dryan s assessment of sagan s cultural significance as a champion of science and david morrison s discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of sagan s predictions carl sagan s cosmic connection is must reading for all sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,positive

i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be,negative
when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith i ordered it the same day after all we seemed to be following the same path i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several firsts in the area of gene cloning then i found christ as a 40 year old my transition was from a semi serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian hearing about dr collins spiritual walk had me intrigued his book should be entitled a politician presents evidence for belief it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research the human genome project is elevated to status of bridge to a momentous new era hogwash hype is the term i would use the dept of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources the author couldn t make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more junk dna than previously thought dr collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school this is not entirely his fault however since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn t perfectly gradual and perfectly random their motivation should be perfectly obvious but it s not even on dr collins radar he also uses mendel s peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel s data was dry labbed usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology dr collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology st augustine and c s lewis i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a lyrical and allegorical flavor i would include the book of jonah in that category as well however there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked the only time dr collins makes a strong case for anything it is to refute edward o wilson richard dawkins and their minions even then he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism francis collins is the consummate politician he takes a stand without offending anyone dr collins knows that jesus was not a politician and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time take this quote from mat 23 14 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation dr collins book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists in my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth,negative
let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy after reading this book i now think he is one step above slime to be fair some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing he is anti pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o donnell michael moore barney frank barbara streisand and that fat girl from the dixie chicks among others no problem there in my opinion that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book the rest is just babble often repeated over and over again that even larry lovers will find annoying a couple things that really bothered me the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of retards and down s syndrome children he must use the term retard at least fifty times in the book this is appreciably different than making a joke about say michael moore moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes the down s syndrome children did not my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on retards he also racially sterotypes in the book many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond the down s syndrome kids can t larry i can only hope god \( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book \) grants you a retard child to love and care for then i would like to read your next book i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses he plays the good ol bubba he ain t too bright and he ain t ever changed since he left the farm his celebrity his word not mine has not gone to his head ok larry why then the better than thou tone throughout the book including speeches and lectures including serious topics such as abortion why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down why the unrelenting references to your celebrity the terms meet and greet and after party were used over and over and over as an example do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are well you are wrong they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become that s hollywood speak my country fart loving nose picking friend overall this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron \( see doesn t that sound better than retard \) my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people those who are dumb and know they are dumb and those who are dumb but are so dumb they don t realize it the former category usually shuts up \( knowing they are dumb \) the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter the first group is obviously smarter than the second larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book make jokes larry and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like unfortunately larry can t see the obvious like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book he has become exactly one of them a thin layer of good ol boy on top covering a core of venom and celebrity he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets my suggestion don t buy larry s act and by all means don t buy the book,negative

i read bill bryson s a walk in the woods and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated \( for the educated aspect bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents \) i started into in a sunburned country with similar expectations and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the land down under my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson s book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia \( senility be merciful and consume me hastily \) my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a 350 page book about australia during and or after his trip his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a story relayed second hand from one of the australians he met such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents these at least provided for some interesting reading after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson s books \( i m a stranger here myself \) after she read a walk in the woods it would appear that in a sunburned country is not the only snore fest that bryson has churned out perhaps he isn t a one hit wonder but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out so if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in a walk in the woods look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed,negative
this book styron s finest is about redemption heralded by the epigraph from john donne the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it s impossible to put down but it s also to styron s great credit that the novel s theme redemption through confrontation with death and violence is reflected through its feverish style there are not many books in the postwar era and none in the united states that have such a non moralistic but intensely moral character and impact echoes of the greek tragedians \( several times evoked in the text \) and of dostoyevski abound finally the crucial role by the most fleshed out non expatriate character a philosophical italian small town cop named luigi elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers don t even seem to understand let alone approach it s a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet,positive

the other boleyn girl and the queen s fool are two of the best books i ve ever read and i ve read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin s lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it s channeled from another source and times when it s harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i m going back to trollope,negative

we have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate computing engineering and systems program \( university of los andes colombia \) there are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one \( e g people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs \) however to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded when other reviewers give 1 star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not occur this presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis in chapter 8 you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic sums and logical quantifications are for example treated in an uniform way maybe the type concept is not so fine explained but one has to remember that this is an introductory book 5 stars of course,positive
his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world and that the united states is already an empire but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life thus we get distracted too easily from important events overseas and when we do try to intervene we want quick fixes and low costs i couldn t agree more with most of these points as an american i m greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map also the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions countless times i believe america has done more harm than good by if you will talking the talk but not walking the walk if we commit to something we need to follow through this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past we ve claimed to support democracy in latin america but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam s suffering without changing the end result at all with all this commonality however there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i can t bring myself to agree with basically he didn t sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone won t our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts when ferguson hold s up the british empire as a model of success i can t help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism japan and germany were already highly developed before world war ii so it probably wasn t that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state even if the positive power of empire is conceded there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now it s a concern of immunity from repercussions in the golden age of imperialism europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires not to say that there were no reprercussions but with the only modern navies in the world europe was immune to any very serious threats on the other hand in today s world as an effect of globalization power has become more decentralized in some respects think wmds terrorists and foreign investments in the u s economy for example can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could in the end colossus didn t settle any agruments for me but raised new and interesting questions it is a book that makes you think and that in and of itself is worth four stars,positive

i had never read a danielle steel book before and decided to give her a try given that she is so popular and has so many books published i was pretty disappointed i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic however if a book is unrealistic but well written and engaging i would still like it i think the biggest problem with this book is the author s excessive repetitiveness yes i get that this character is really cold and unloving that was already covered 50 pages ago in addition character traits could have been better conveyed through situations rather than simply stating so and so was a devoted mother and repeating this fact again and again and again these flaws in the author s writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms steel s books it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy repetitive reading,negative

i had heard of the importance and significance of the education of henry adams for a long time i finally determined i needed to read it i acutally read it twice and found less in it the second time than the first i am sorry i missed the greatness of this book i am sure there was something wrong with me but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there granted he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second rate occupants of the white house but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue blooded snob like adams depresses me why did anyone bother he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery sharp tongues clever remarks and brilliant conversation the world went on without him truth be told and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day he was a very good historian in his time but who reads his books now not very many in short his own work was not as long lasting as he would have wanted it to be maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams the education of henry adams does not have much real information he got education in one place none in others surely the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry but he wrote nothing about it in his book when eric sevareid wrote not so wild a dream it was compared to the education of henry adams that was meant as a compliment oddly i think sevareid s book is much much better sevareid wrote of america the common man the war and what it all meant to him adams needed to get out more he did not see america not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together and defended it i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams again a lot of this might be me perhaps i read the book at a bad time maybe i needed to read it a third time i do not know i do know i do not think this is a great american classic forgive please my ignorance,negative
the other boleyn girl and the queen s fool are two of the best books i ve ever read and i ve read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin s lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it s channeled from another source and times when it s harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i m going back to trollope,negative
i like this author s work so much that i actually bought the hard cover since i couldn t wait for the pb to be issued however p d james view of life as expressed by her characters can be very pessimistic at times \( a contrast to her autobiography \) in this one there is still the feeling that the characters are going through the motions of living never really feeling any joy or often even happiness however when adam and emma come together at the end there was a ray of hope please ms james give us a new book asap,positive
i m perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read grapes of wrath or east of eden instead i have focused on of mice and men and his lesser known works such as to a god unknown and my personal favorite pastures of heaven i ve been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular when i began reading in dubious battle it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck s work telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac s radical cell there is a great \( and misleading \) sense of intrigue mac and jim travel by boxcar work secretly through letters go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers early on the pace is fast exciting and engaging suddenly steinbeck simply fails to deliver leaving the reader wondering when he s going to pick up the pace again after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker s strike i expected the sense of excitement to continue it simply never does summary of in dubious battle workers get mad workers get tired workers get mad workers get tired workers get mad workers get tired the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking and talking and talking and talking and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense and eating steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story because at least a good 25 of the story concerns finding eating and \( worst of all \) talking about food there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment discussing whatever comes to mind steinbeck s sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters but i advise any reader of in dubious battle to take this course after the strike is initiated simply set the book down you won t miss anything nothing of great import happens and only a very few memorable characters ever surface and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces i suppose now i ll give grapes of wrath a go perhaps if it isn t one of his greats it isn t worth reading,negative

clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth,negative
this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb however its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo intellectualizations it should be noted that this book was not written by hale it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale s classic drawing lessons from the great masters instead this book loses itself in unimportant erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle confuse frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory,negative
how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding,negative
i was extremely disappointed with after midnight the author his widow has written the book from her own life s perspective and there is sadly little about the true brad davis his homosexuality or perhaps bisexuality is mentioned only in passing and anyone in new york or hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life i guess a book written by his wife can t be expected to delve too deeply into this area but even other interesting details his drug addiction his acting technique etc are only minimally suggested here i wanted to put the book down after two chapters but kept waiting for it to get interesting i suggest the publishers retitle the book my life with brad davis the saga of a wife kept in the dark or something similar to indicate to readers that this book is about susan bluestein and tells very little about brad,negative
after reading the trilogy i was left wondering what the hell happened i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story one of the most creative stories i ve come across in 20 years of reading fantasy there isn t even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess if you look up anticlimax in the dictionary you ll see a picture of this book from first page to last time is wasted on boring characters while all the good ones are either killed off or just mia for the entire book spoilers ahead what about lyra and her parents somehow she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops over a cup of tea naturally and that s it for him in addition to all that this book doesn t even seem to be connected to the first two none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 all in the last 30 pages what happened to the story for cripes sake and what happened to the temptation was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it the whole premise is just so lame to start out with as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn t endanger the universe why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another supposedly they had more than gonads going for them they survived death together pullman didn t feel like thinking it through he just wanted a gut wrenching ending in addition to that he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the reality of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning all of will and lyra s efforts are futile kind of like guess what religion for the rest of us morons after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa elephant aliens or whatever ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper iorek byrnison lee scoresby instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter this is not children s literature it s a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess it s totally dishonest to sell this as a children s book or even as a competent work of fiction all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one we never get closure on lyra s parents we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from we never see will reunited with his mother we get a lame battle where god dies and no one even knows why or how lyra and will fall in love but have to sacrifice it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever with only flimsy reasoning behind it the mulefa and mary malone s work together amounts to nothing everyone just goes home presumably will goes home although we never see it all that yearning after his mother and so forth nothing the major enemies are killed off too easily and what about armageddon what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and you get the idea it all just sort of disovles mary forgot to be the serpent or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa another reader pointed out phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series instead the story falls flat under the weight of the author s own agendas and mockeries what a waste of time i can t believe this book actually won awards it stopped being thought provoking and started being inane and silly it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream instead relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime absurd this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life,negative

i ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my 7 year old son we re doing a research project on oceans and while we have a few good resources i felt this one with its 3d imagery would more likely capture and hold his attention what i didn t realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine for me 3d had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches though the book was described as stereoscopic i didn t understand what that meant stereography was something new for me even if as a form of photography it is over 150 years old this is not a matter of red and blue separations the 3d results from the human eye s trick of blending 2 photos taken \( simultaneously \) an eye s width apart photographer mark blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d photography and his work is beautifully displayed here everyone i ve shown this book to has been fascinated by it and i fully expect that when we ve finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home,positive
this is the latest in a never ending series of books trying to generalize non business world \( eg sports armed forces girl scouts religion nasa etc \) management techniques to the business world most possibly all are of little value because of major differences 1 \) members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently and face greatly significantly different situations what does eg a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist nurse professor financial analyst etc i have no idea 2 \) key success factors vary from one business to another for merck it may be speed of developing new drugs getting through fda approval and motivating physicians to use them for nucor steel it undoubtedly rests much more on low cost production again what does either have to do with fighter pilots little if anything one is better off reading books from similar situations eg about wal mart \( if you are in retailing \) about allied signal or g e \( if you are managing a conglomerate \) and about new york community school district 4 as managed by sy fliegel if you are in public school,negative

this is an enlightening meticulous story of william boss tweed and as past of the context his three key cronies in the ring peter sweeny richard connolly and oakley hall it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page oh how the mighty have fallen the time of power \( terror \) for tweed s edition of tammany hall was relatively short but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed s demise another eithy five years the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build a disgruntled whistleblower \( the term had no meaning back then \) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times hands but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the ring could be how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people s friend the government can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution the cast of characters sinners \( few \) saints and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task thomas nast a pivotal character if not the hero of the book provides some vivid visual signposts nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate readers he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today s politicians nast s giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail a few maps perhaps some old drawings and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed s nefarious deeds and nast s colorful cartoons ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing filling in the gaps and bringing now faded black and white characters back to life,positive

generally my eyes glaze over as i reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious make your own luck by shapiro and stevenson has broken the pattern written in punchy conversational style the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision making the process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure this sounds as if it could be tedious but it s not the authors know you are not sitting in a policy course they know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet the book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus in managing investments i m betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors the tools in make your own luck such as the prediction map are completely applicable to the inferential analysis i use in managing investments as well as life s major problems such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party this book is a good read shapiro and stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the metropolitan museum of art make your own luck makes you laugh makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot,positive
i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details but also historical background because it s an autobiography i don t necessarily think that it s fair to damn the book for being self centered it is about him i do feel however that the book needs better editing and a bit more self examination it s an okay addition to one s list of books about everest expeditions which i must admit i ve developed a morbid fascination with after recently re reading into thin air i wouldn t however use it as my primary source for information or impressions,negative

this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president each individual section includes a brief summary of the president s successes and failures while in office the secrets lives aspect includes a description of his temperament character and personal habits for example john adams is said to have been vain and irritable while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic also much oddball trivia is mentioned such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood the biographical information is at least somewhat educational especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here the truth is that o brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few books such as the reader s companion to the american presidency and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining also o brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars however what i found most disturbing about this book is o brien s tone and attitude his so called humorous style is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents especially those he dislikes for example he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had some unknown frontal lobe damage i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president in fact i disagree with much of jackson s presidential agenda especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians however i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o brien uses overall i found the book to be juvenile mean spirited and overly negative there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there so don t waste your time on this one,negative

overall i found this book disappointing in its defense its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the right \( more closed and intensely religious \) is interesting and i am sure accurate and heilman s analysis of its evolution is insightful and well researched however i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture hareidi society has its own worldview which although too complex to elaborate on here has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores \( for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try real jews by noah efron \) in general i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct \( i e a defensive reaction to the holocaust \) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well or two posters \( put out by the same company \) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music in conclusion although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information,negative

i was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and or loss weight was incidental in this fiercely intelligent novel dorothy and justine are both desperately lonely women both victims of abuse and yet are different in other ways their parents often failed them their childhood was often full of shame and self sabotage but gaitskill writes this with complexity always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer gaitskill is never sentimental underneath her narrative underneath the pain and the sex scenes \( which are never fully loving \) and the disappointments and loneliness is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect on race on class but mostly on gender i sensed that anna granite the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative and who is the reason dorothy and justine first meet is gaitskill s platform for displaying her keen intellect and sometimes there is a hint of didactism but this is a minor quibble the last section moved me very much and proved that although gaitskill abhors sentimentality she can certainly do sentiment well humanity is a word often found in this book our sexuality is connected to our humanity our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human in the end gaitskill s brilliant wonderfully feminist novel was for me about how easily we strip each other of our humanity,positive

i was wrong ok i ve admitted it i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren t my cup of tea while reading conspiracy in death i realized i couldn t have been more wrong i love this futuristic series a homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to eve dallas since it s not a random act of violence this man snooks died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon when dallas digs a bit further she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in new york city where an aged lc \( licensed companion \) died as the result of her liver being removed after even more digging dallas discovers a case in chicago and one abroad that were all similar these were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying in order for eve dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen the closer she got to that answer the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became when she got too close to the truth the villain had to put a stop to her investigation the best way to get dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department this was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered snook s body and dallas when that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on dallas stripped of her badge and weapon the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied the main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise there was excellent character development and as usual j d robb \( aka nora roberts \) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book what makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of eve dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that at times it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot this is definitely one to read as all of the in death series books have been start with the first book when reading because j d robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings or you can start with the first book just because it s the beginning of an excellent adventure,positive
having read this book as well as barnet schacter s on new york during the revolution both works i find are flawed in different ways the likeable thing about gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time the hard thing to realize about the battle of brooklyn is that it really wasn t much of a battle the author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle if that is so then the complete defeat of washy s army bodes ill for that development gallagher is on better ground when he provides a nice overall of tactics and warfare in the 18th century he gives a good account of training and recruitment in both armies one of the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the two rank line used by both sides in the revolutionary war casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light this is an interesting point and one not brought out by many historians of the period in europe stronger lines of 3 and sometimes 4 ranks were employed which provided greater strength but also more density hence increased loss from fire a point well worth considering when looking at the battles of the revolution most historians miss this completely or are not interested in it gallagher provides more of a military history in general on this subject but he does waste a lot of time with preleminaries more than half of the book is spent providing the standard background for the causes of the revolution etc while certainly required for the general reader when a book is as short as this one is it seems almost pointless when we get down to the battle itself gallagher gives us not much more than schacter does the british flank march completely compromises washy s position the outlying forces are swept away clear and simple the confusion of command between putnam and sullivan no doubt made a bad situation worse washy s complete lack of strategic perspective shows up totally here the defense of brooklyn much less manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion washy was mad to consider defending brooklyn much less manhatten in the first place he committed his ill trained army to an impossible task that he did not lose completely was due more to how the british under howe chose to wage their campaign most american authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially a dark canvas at brooklyn the americans ran period a few units stood their ground in particular the marylanders but no one else really did the reason why american losses were not greater was because they did run some authors try to say that british losses in killed and wounded were greater than americans at this battle this is true partly because the british had to attack some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the assault british losses were often greater in this regard because americans usually ran once the british bayonet began to strike home still of the 1 000 casualities sustained by the americans here more than most us historians care to admit fell to british musketry and bayonets the british loss was still well below 400 as the great maurice de saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in this period more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he runs as opposed to when he stands to reserve fire until the enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of this period in that respect many dozens of rebels must have been shot down as they ran before british bayonets gallagher provides some understanding why the british did not storm the heights right away this has often been one of the major criticisms of howe s victory why didn t he follow up after marching all night to outflank the americans the british were disorganized and tired they had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm brooklyn heights memory of bunker hill or no of course this does not explain why it was not done the following day if we look more closely at howe s position we can perhaps explain his rationale his commission was both a general and peacemaker he wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold he could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to the crown was to have destroyed washy s army in brooklyn would have been gratuitous excessive such loss of blood would have defeated the purpose in mind in restrospect it is easy to find fault with this strategy and it would prove to be the only chance the british really had to crush the revolution in its infancy the battle of brooklyn needs to be looked at from several perspectives gallagher gives us a good start but i think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the issues here,positive

always lively and perspicacious this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations \( weapons diseases horses etc \) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america australia new zealand and argentina \( the lands crosby labels neo europes \) what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well the question doesn t appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion but the european housefly and feral pigs and a horde of other weeds pests crops diseases and livestock from europe followed suit quite often these organisms even the domesticated ones raced ahead of european explorers themselves rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom why was this so why didn t say australian weeds their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe to answer this odd question professor crosby begins his story with pangaea the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe these seams of pangaea then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid oceanic seams crosby details case after case in each category weeds pests livestock diseases and crops he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear what is the answer he drops clues every now and then and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all here then is the answer all the opportunistic fellow travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations and they in turn furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium together humans horses cattle pigs rats clover peaches measles and yes dandelions comprised a potent self replicating system dimly discerned by its contemporaries that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea,positive
this book has a wealth of information for any practitioner of yoga from beginner to advanced the content is concise and practical and the poses are sequenced in a way that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice there are also dozens of practice sequences given for both improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga the introduction is especially valuable as it offers a no fluff in depth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana practice i pick it up again and again and am still referring to it after nearly 15 years of owing it my copy is dog eared and loved and was well worth every penny an earlier reviewer mentioned that the photos and layout were not user friendly and only gave the book two stars which is a shame this book was first printed in the mid 1960 s over 40 years ago it was the first yoga book of it s kind to ever be printed and it s content is timeless and as relevant today as ever mr iyengar even had to struggle with his then publisher to be allowed to include so many photos as it was so expensive in those days to print such a book i say hats off to the man who brought yoga to the west long before it was ready he s a pioneer and a virtuoso of his craft and his marvelous work should never be over overlooked just because it doesn t come in some glossy package fit for the masses,positive

i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president \( \) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup \( so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large \) anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously so i m not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the 8 50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me but you can guess how this ended up i am down another 8 dollars and change \( i paid the 50 cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it \) and i never finished the book since it was ruined but i liked the parts i read okay and if the president likes it i guess it gets four stars only i made it two stars because i only read half maybe i will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then i will come back and give this book it s missing two stars if it ends well lesson learned is life is not always fair but you keep on keepin on like they say,negative

an amazing resource to the odd world of chick collecting mr fowler has crafted an exhausting almost overwhelming guide to all of chick s works and articles about him everything is cross referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter the book \( presented in a distinctive computer printout style possibly due to its origins as a self published work \) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers but even casual chick fans will enjoy the history of the world segment which ties all of jack s wild theories into a cohesive narrative and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia \( there s a list of every instance of the term haw for instance \) each tract and comic is described and info is given on various parodies and rip offs this is a must for all chick fans \( both saved and otherwise \),positive

if you like this book you will probably like bless the child by cathy cash spellman they are very similar this book can be summed up in one word simple simple minded simple characters simple plot \( applied loosely \) and simple premise what a contrived piece of garbage i can t describe everything wrong with this book because there s not enough time if it s meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through if it s meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims in denial weak worried about what everyone thinks or oblivious if it s meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author s plea for that is irritating that s how bad this book is it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying this author has no style the book reads like an episode of inside edition there is no immersion into the story the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them as a reader i felt completely outside the story an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable i ve been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me do not waste your time i must say though that this novel was inspirational if this crap can make the best seller list it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published,negative

this book is a disappointment it provides little insight into the life or personality of robert redford the actor or the person the book is basically a chronicle of the movies rr has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor but even as a filmography the book fails the reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on tv or in the press in addition the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down robert redford with snide remarks there must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar for sure it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as robert redford however it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject and if they can t do so then there is no book,negative

i truly wanted to like this book after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i d feared but downright enjoyable in addition i d heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last alas it was all down hill from there overall this is one of the worst books i ve ever forced myself to finish this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack author of two other published novels and a short story collection director of a university level creative writing program long term teacher of writing and holder of a ph d in same all to considerable critical acclaim she should be correcting and grading \( failing \) garbage like this not producing it so what went wrong how did this novel end up so awful the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things length if brevity is the soul of wit this novel s witlessness is easily explained at 666 pages \( interesting number that \) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been it would seem that to some extent like melville before her naslund confused length with importance but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self parody somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing with a meat axe or a chainsaw the name dropping one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures but if badly handled these encounters can un suspend disbelief and downright offend they are badly handled here an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid nineteenth century new england and those she doesn t utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund s peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne one or two of these developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude as it is it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor \( or the self awareness \) the politics even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing however naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day \( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day \) from slavery to whaling from feminism to free love from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled all without consequence or even criticism this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today which is to say none the anti christian bigotry there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish the bigoted the future apostate or the mentally ill it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi religious idea of the time except christianity the farfetched scenarios i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi lesbian encounter after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her \( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand \) una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal minded aunt and uncle encounters two young men who both fall in love with her disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them successfully avoids detection is sunk by a whale survives by committing cannibalism marries the surviving young man after he goes insane and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians leaving her free to marry captain ahab \( una never really marries anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes \) things don t get more realistic in the second half which includes una s clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale riiiight the mary sue however the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a mary sue that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader a more realistic main character might have saved it una never learns anything from her life s too many to be believed experiences because she already knows everything she doesn t change because she is already perfect she doesn t have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn t receive any and she doesn t have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides una had her reasons \( and they were very good ones you can be sure \) the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it i feel like i ve just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom with the door locked,negative
if you like physics this is just an interesting book it mostly discusses at length two ideas emergence and reductionism doesn t sound like much and it isn t but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world unfortunately from this point of view to the horizon is not that far mr mclaughlin almost calls the present theories \( like string theory \) science fiction easy on science \( because of the scales and energies involved he seems to think they are not provable i don t have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not \) but he doesn t offer much of an alternative he even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible or not practical well even if he is right which i hope he isn t between can t and science fiction i prefer science fiction tomorrow i ll read a bit of string theory and shake off the depressive mood left by this book,negative

i was intrigued by his the end of history i thought his trust was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books in the end the great disruption is a down right silly book it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama s humanistic ideology clouds it all all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly anna conclusion that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good fukuyama proves that the moral consensus the social capital of the earlier era has been wiped away that crime has sky rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital he doesn t bother to deal with societies like ethiopia that have never been able to build up enough social capital he doesn t really look any further back in history past about 1950 his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history he thinks \( based on his ideology of human goodness \) that things just have to get better if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history he would know better people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long term historical cycles for that i would recommend robert w fogel s the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism fogel a nobel prize winner has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up,negative

more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn t make that connection having read a few of faulkner s works sturgeon uses many of faulkner s narrative trademarks \( i e streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative \) but i didn t feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others so the idea might of been original in the 50 s but topics like telekenesis esp computer brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before \( asimov \) and since this book rarely set off that wow button in my head or kept me turning pages this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book \( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 \) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting \( in this example \) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can t really be ignored besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood s end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci fi needless to say more than human did not win \( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so \) bottom line i wanted to like this book and it doesn t surprise me that others give it such high praise these are probably people that don t read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests,negative

this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u s administrations in that sense it is the story of two cities miami and washington and two peoples americans and cubans i have an objection though with the stone hard style in which this volume is so meticulously even gorgeously at times written didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and worse the result is a cold humorless colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup the author in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end readers it is in that sense a boring little disaster of a book,negative

i came across this book while on vacation in a cabin in minnesota i read the entire thing in two days and loved it so much i considered taking it with me this was back before the internet and it took me nine years to find a copy of it that i could buy it was worth the wait these are some of the best short stories i ve ever read they are very well written original and gripping tales that are fun to read and reread if only there were more writers like mr ellin,positive
i must agree with some other reviewers of this book and say that it is a very dry list of factual data interspersed with bill wyman s moans and boasts his gripe with allan klein about money seems to be quite valid but he mentions it about a thousand times mick and keith get quite a pasting again it seems quite valid but do we need to hear it so many times bill opines that keith richard s voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band listen to his only self penned stones track of the 60s on satanic majesties and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion his voice is far weaker and his songwriting at that time was also inferior the book seems to be more authoritative on dates but we can only take bill s accuracy on faith my knowledge of the stones is not enormous but even i can see some big factual errors for example he tells us that neither taj mahal nor marianne faithfull recorded songs for the rock n roll circus a recent re issue has proved him completely wrong as another reviewer rightly said marianne faithfull s autobiog is a much better read,negative

this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth as some readers have complained this is not really a christian book because the focus isn t on christ it s on you a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally the way jesus would and not on trying to find the perfect spouse the whole premise of the book is rather un christlike making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you it s rather selfish really when you consider the words of john the baptist christ must become more i must become less as well as the warning in song of solomon do not awaken love until it so desires shouldn t our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines hearts can be broken and therefore authentic christlike love must take precedence i don t mean to sound accusing but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls seduction my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a poser this happens when forcing yourself to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex you have to ask what kind of people are you trying to attract people who are enticed by your masculinity femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality it is a combination of both action and faith that is important faith to set the situations up action to knock em down,negative
i agree with a number of previous reviewers grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between wicca and witchcraft wicca is not an old religion indeed it is not much of a religion at all it has always lacked definite theology \( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you ll get four answers \) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non scholarly lights in fact the book is poor on all accounts from confused terminology to chopping of source materials this is a waste of money,negative
this truly excellent collection of singer s stories \( all originally composed in the yiddish language \) are as colorful as the people about whom the stories were written here are tales of weddings of jokesters of happy occasions of all variety of feuding farmwives and of unrepentant fools after reading through a handful of singer s works a person gets the feeling of how it must have been to live as a jew in eastern europe a hundred years ago this was a culture rich in its traditions and lore a people who loved life and kept their identity through good times and bad singer himself born and raised in the region so many of his short stories describe was one of very few authors i would unhesitantly dub a human treasure,positive

i ve skimmed a number of popular books published in the last few years on the problem of sexless marriage and this is by far most interesting contribution to date first there is no recommendations for drug therapy anywhere in the book second the author frequently brings into the discussion a european influenced view of some particularly american style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex parenthood gender politics and relationship expectations her fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness and in the course of building and sustaining security we can frequently lose the me and you in us but even more important she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward an egalitarian union while great for chores and child care can be a neutralizer in the bedroom you may or may not find strands of your own dilemma in her case histories but you will not walk away from them empty handed either there are many aspects of the book which are highly nuanced and won t survive well in the o reilly world of broadcast media interviews i can just hear some producer fed talking head asking something like you advocate couples go to vegas for swinging why \( she doesn t \) so don t pay attention to that noise this is an intellegent respectful contemplative work of original thinking that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives and pabulum buy one for yourself and one for your best friend more than likely they re suffering too,positive
this book is as close to perfect as you can get i personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of india worth noting the mistry book a fine balance while good is basically a full on rip off of this book if you want the original read rushdie mistry should be ashamed his is not even a different take it is just another take of the same image and not as good,positive

never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr west in this book \( in his translator s note \) and by the use of unponderingly and the thinkery \( among other things \) in his translation of the clouds i also read his translation of plato s apology of socrates and found it grossly inferior to jowett four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly it should be hurled with great force \( apologies to dorothy parker \) not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept almost everything that he writes in his translator s note is wrong the clouds is a play not a scientific or mathematical treatise as such it has characters and dialogue a modern translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a modern audience if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary one does not make him spout drivel such as unponderingly one gives him a shtick which is a theatrical term it s more or less a running gag associated with a particular character you create through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together a characterization he could be made to speak like a parody of william f buckley or the star wars character yoda as it stands west s text cannot be presented as a play it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as unponderingly indeed it is inexcusable it conveys neither humor nor cleverness it comes off simply as stupid the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters which dr west obviously does not to state it bluntly the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization and who are creative dr west doesn t have a creative bone in his body in regard to his translation of plato s the apology of socrates the translation by dr west is both original and good but the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good after all when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow the temptation to do something entirely different is strong but it must be resisted if dr west had merely lightly revised jowett s great work he would have made a contribution to learning alas he did neither the version by jowett is clearly superior here is a short excerpt and i must beg of you to grant me a favor if i defend myself in my accustomed manner and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora at the tables of the money changers or anywhere else i would ask you not to be surprised and not to interrupt me on this account for i am more than seventy years of age and appearing now for the first time in a court of law i am quite a stranger to the language of the place and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion of his country am i making an unfair request of you never mind the manner which may or may not be good but think only of the truth of my words and give heed to that let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly compare west s inept version i do very much beg and beseech this of you if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money tables where many of you have heard me and elsewhere do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this for this is how it is now is the first time i have come before a law court at the age of seventy hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here so just as if i really did happen to be a foreigner you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised so also i do beg of you now \( and it is just at least as it seems to me \) leave aside the manner of my speech for perhaps it may be worse but perhaps better and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this whether the things i say are just or not for this is the virtue of a judge while that of an orator is to speak the truth speaking with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak how utterly inept and repetitive didn t he even proof read one doesn t speak with speeches one speaks with words it is obvious that dr west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness which is surprising because this work is supposed to be a speech dr west s version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud whereas jowett s is in west s translation socrates is a clumsy repetitive and inept speaker needlessly so if you want to read a good translation see jowett s 3rd edition \( 1892 \) why does dr west believe himself qualified to make translations nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so this is not the work of a scholar but that of a bungling hack these translations are travesties how does work this nauseatingly bad get published not recommende,negative

some photographers think what s erotic is what s hidden and left to the imagination two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing leaving plenty to the imagination think of playboy magazine in the 1950 s or vogue or madamoselle magazine today many of these are stylistic but not very erotic one in three of the photos in the book are erotic not afraid of nudity don t make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism instead get shaven angels natural beauties 100 naked girls or crazy sexy girls,negative

this book captures the human spirit at both its best and its worst schwarz bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of ernie levy from birth and on he also shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the nazi movement it is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the jewish people it is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a just man although without them humanity would crumble as future readers will find out their importance and if there really are just men in our world we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders,positive
after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry what kind of people you ll be dealing with what the hiring pricess is like \( with particular emphasis on the interviews \) and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired i m very glad that i took the time to read this book because after finishing it i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable obviously this is simply my own opinion and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work but nearly every single thing about it from the superficial way applicants are screened to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job sounds simply awful to me if you are considering a career as a drug rep you should definitely do your homework to make sure it s really something you would enjoy this book may very well convince you that you would love it if so that s great and i hope you are successful but if this kind of work is not right for you this book can be equally helpful because you ll find out by reading it what the job is really like there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now and although this one was helpful i have to say that i think insider s guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one if you only buy one book definitely buy that one instead but if you buy two books pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice one more thing there s some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants from their shoes to their body language he also stresses well written resumes and cover letters one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it imagine my surprise then when on the very next page it says candidates should right a short paragraph about their job experiences it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book,positive
billy collins s original voice is delightfully accessible often blending comedy and solemnity in one poem and always with something new to say the playful tone of these poems can be misleading whether he is writing about eating a good plate of osso bucco or his favorite museum rooms there is always a pathos lingering in the silence after the last line most relieving is the absence of pretentiousness or haughty language this is simply as robert bly writes in his introduction to the best american poems of 1999 collins s skillful ability to bring the soul up close to the thing in every poem books such as the art of drowning threaten to change the face and purpose of poetry in the 21st century let s hope there is plenty more to come from billy collins,positive

did we need a gore vidal reader the author is something of a long winded blowhard commenting at length \( and i mean length \) on every topic imaginable in that respect he is america s voltaire creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics the arts and religion and morals it s hard to say where vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism as he is not a conventional leftist because of his iconoclasm this collection can only inform the reader about gore vidal not his times nor any intellectual or political movement all that said vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit this book is much too much for the casual reader stick to one of his many shorter collections instead but for a vidal fan \( or say a reader of the nation \) this book is worth the time commitment,positive
along with from science to god mr russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work it has the same hopeful message and the same readability in both books mr russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo even when discussing very complicated subjects that isn t a statement on his intelligence or research but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings in short everyone can sit around his table \( well almost everyone \) read em twice,positive

alien invasion stories have been done to death since h g wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time honored genre well william c dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is first of all the invading force being made up of different races this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles in fighting and fight for freedom \( some are slaves to others \) make for something new different and engaging also using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true and tragic note the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves close off their borders and horde resources the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth and sadly collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans but the seeds of rebellion have been planted humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting,positive

i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers i wasn t as happy with some of her latest efforts but still hadn t given up on her now i m not so sure this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring perhaps it was barr s attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages each scene was more disturbing the one before it i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends but i have absolutely no desire to re read the end of the book and find out i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones but after reading this disturbing somewhat convoluted story i would think twice if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel i d make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn i would certainly not stick with it to the end,negative

unfortunately for all the name brand that this book conveys i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales boggles this readers mind the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book i would be astounded save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation by the way those giving 5 stars either can t read english very well or are shills for mckinsey,negative
jonathan glover s book is not quite like anything you ve read on war state terror and genocide the tour of twentieth century horrors is thematic rather than chronological organized according to the ethical issues glover wants to explore this takes a little getting used to but it allows the author to jump for example from the first world war to the cuban missile crisis to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future the cumulative power of glover s pointillist technique is enormous humanity combines a clear eyed \( necessarily often gruesome \) depiction of in humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better as an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide it marks an advance on ervin staub s classic roots of evil and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics,positive
temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist the author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts conditions locations in the book and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about gabby including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life book was not for me i dropped it at the 3rd chapter,negative

i recently read robert monroe s first book journeys out of body and found it to be a disappointment it was just weird as i noted in my review of that book i had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound for which he is allegedly noted as i purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read i thought i d give it a try the book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his research and i thought that perhaps this book might actually have some real substance that belief however quickly disappeared by the time i had reached the half way point in the book nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish how does total garbage like this manage to get printed there are those that claim that monroe was a highly left brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right brain if this book is any indication one can t help but wonder if monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere there is nothing logical or for that matter even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book it would have been worthwhile if monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner instead he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own personal dream experiences these wander so aimlessly from paragraph to paragraph that one can t help but wonder what real point if any he was trying to make the really sad thing is that i had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work i was actually quite interested in the topic having now been subjected to two of his useless books i m amazed that they re still in print this is pseudo science at its absolute worst,negative
this book provides a fine introduction to the myths of northern europe the book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose written by christian writers after the fact the eddas beowulf and the viking sagas from these sources especially the edda the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the norse gods and their subsequent twilight in ragnarok then the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the northern european peoples the figures of odin thor loki balder and the rest of the norse gods play an important part in our european cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of ragnarok \( the twilight of the gods \) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the christian worldview whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand northern europe in pre christian times finally it must be noted that in many ways at least in my opinion the society of the vikings was superior to our own i admire the strong sense of individualism that the vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats,positive

this book doesn t even deserve a star i just fell upon it on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house i m nearly 17 years old and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older but honestly i don t see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years i ve read so many reviews raving about how poetic sensual wonderful it is and what a talent the person is sorry i don t see it anyone can write a bunch of sex stories i didn t see anything poetic in the writing it was plain as for sensual and arousing hardly it was crude and vulgar it was sex sex sex and presented harshly with none of the sensuality the sweetness the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex it was boring repetitive and i ll admit disturbing what was the point of the story where the hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children or the raped little boy it was just weird there s just the sex and no development of any points she may be trying to make it s kind of just left there unfinished unsatisfying frankly it was so distasteful \( vulgar \) i was shocked and i m not religious puritan conservative or any such thing quite the opposite i have an open mind but this book left me cold,negative
i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena however i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me i disagree with the simplistic conclusion \( among others \) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china,negative

maybe believe your suspenders i m not sure which it seems to me that to enjoy this book you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability you also have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist who s pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet earth seems pretty improbable what you get in return are some amazing language some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish much too cerebral to ever be made into a movie by any director alive now this is a book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked out but craftsman like writing,positive
after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes noble that same night dr whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers however if at home you are on dr whitley s 10 step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation the constant image of mr rogers in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents of course that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he she is capable of frightening resistance obviously professional help with someone in tuned with dr whitley s methods would be more advisable than his book to me this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less and possibly 7 8th graders these kids still have some moldability and aren t as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem \( i e depression \) for the grammatically correct the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author 0 \),positive
many words few practical tips this book did not give much more \( valuable \) information than i already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer after reading the book i still had to search for web communities where some of my questions could be answered my expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks contacts and appointments unfortunately in my view these important and basic issues were treated too superficially,negative
while talk to the hand is inescapably mediocre in comparison to eats shoots leaves a book i found amusing though not up to par to its new york times bestseller status this book does have its moments however i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that despite whatever way she meant it ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice i find it interesting that she or at least her editors did not further investigate the disease \( which indeed gluten tolerance is \) before publishing such a degrading remark oh yes bloody well sorry ms truss for invading your rude stay home and bolt the door causitive world with yet another irritation which i m sure someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet let s just go and well obliterate a genetic disorder while we re at it we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk if it pleases and thanks you ms truss we celiacs will eat cake \( oh bloody hell did i just say please \) despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place i have to wonder if she s experiencing the effects of projection in explaining how rude we humans are it was necessary for her to be quite rude as well it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer i also found her supermarket incident in which a kid shouts at his mother i want that one you effing bitch among others a bit offensive as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness i was often thoroughly appalled by this book no my friends and i don t usually hold doors for each other but in general i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown frankly i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends as well as strangers than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation or if they must answer they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them i have to argue that we are not a select group in today s world one sees what one expects to see one is treated as one expects to be treated ms truss i believe would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could she would be surprised to find that when people are rude she cares less because she knows that she at least is doing her best not to be if she did this maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior my last complaint is this gluten crap you would think that such a sophisticated eloquent \( as she is dedicated to proving \) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third year am i not so cool and bitchin \( \) style word crap,negative

david baldacci has a knack for writing fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters this book is no exception sara evans is a clerk working for a supreme court justice she is quite close to another clerk \( michael fiske \) who works for a different judge michael asks sara to marry him but sara really loves michael s brother john who sara has only seen once and never officially met michael comes across an appeal that intrigues him \( to say exactly why would be a spoiler and it is only revealed very late in the book as to exactly what intrigued him \) so much that he pulls it out before it is filed and goes to visit the requestor that happens to be a rufus harms who is serving a life sentence in an army prison for murdering a girl when michael goes to see harms practically all hell breaks loose and harms realizes he is in danger himself and some mysterious evil guys from the prison murder michael apparently there was some secrets in harms appeal that some powerful unknown men do not want known michael s murder is investigated by his brother john \( an ex cop who is now a defense lawyer for the lowest of the low criminals \) and he enlists the aid of sara who was close to michael and knows some things about michael sara is instantly in love with john and the more they start investigating the more they put their lives at risk from the unknown powerful men additionally the police start to suspect john of the murder of his brother especially when he is named as the sole beneficiary of michael s life insurance meanwhile rufus harms has escaped prison from some of those men that tried to kill him so we have tension throughout to see if rufus will survive as well as john and sara before the evil guys get them there is a lot of good information about what goes on behind the scenes at the supreme court a good rea,positive

maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender but by the reviews here all by women i can see that jance writes to that crowd her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue the insulin bottle jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time if you want a good mystery read coben crais patterson or michael connely,negative
mark twain once said that \( and i paraphrase \) the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read that is my experience with this book for some reason a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt so i picked it up what a slog a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton a character who you barely get to know and root for lucie manette the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge an admittedly cool concept maybe this book speaks to another era maybe it s past its prime maybe i don t have the required literary sensibilities or maybe i couldn t relate but a tale of two cities bored me to tears,negative

dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it dragonart how to draw fantastic dragons and fantasy creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper dragonart is divided into three major parts fantastic dragons unique details and other fantasy creatures along with an introduction a section on how to use the book and a brief guide to fantastic creatures lessons in this book are progressive in nature beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design all illustrated with step by step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout and author artist jessica neondragon peffer has a clear easy writing style that can be easily comprehended absorbed and acted upon an example of which follows below okay so we re going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct but that will happen if your creature doesn t look believable to help make your dragon as real as possible base its structure on real creatures she writes at one point \( page 44 \) the ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat bird and reptile body types the trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out you want it to feel like a single creature this advice incidentally is very reminiscent of that given by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk making peffer well read or naturally very insightful either of which speaks well for her under how you should make an imaginary animal look natural the increasingly famous renaissance man writes you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs each of which in itself must resemble those of some other animal hence if you wish to make an animal imagined by you appear natural let us say a dragon take for its head that of a mastiff or hound with the eyes of a cat the ears of a porcupine the nose of a greyhound the brow of a lion the temples of an old cock the neck of a water tortoise dragonart also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures including basilisks chimeras gargoyles and griffins for those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book a companion dragonart kit how to draw paint fantastic creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon author peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art website neondragonart com which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves,positive

this is a decent book on photographing artwork but not the the most comprehensive the strengths of this book are that mr saddington \( 1 \) discusses the use digital media and \( 2 \) makes the process of photographing artwork very user friendly by providing great visual references throughout the user friendly aspect is the book s strongest selling point especially for artists who are new or novices at photography or visually oriented \( i e no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures \) mr saddington s book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure photograph and provides a concise explanation for these results and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure photograph he also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing the weakness of this book lies in the general details provided unfortunately mr saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting i base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called photographing your artwork by russell hart if you buy mr saddington s book i d recommend supplementing it with the purchase of mr hart s book the two books complement each other where mr saddington s book lacks in details mr hart s book fills in the information gaps on the other hand mr hart s book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations so if you re a visually oriented person mr saddington s book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process again mr saddington s book is decent but it should be used as a supplemental reference especially for the visually oriented person,negative

as a boy i was fascinated by looking at all of the drawings and descriptions in this diary it gave me a great appreciation for life in the us in the early 1800s and the fortitude and ingenuity of our forefathers i have found that the magic still holds as i read it to each of my sons when they were about 8 they still love the basic how to descriptions which bring frontier construction to life,positive
let me get myself straigh here first i have always been a fan of the artemis fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins i loved the first one and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies instead of saving them from some kind of evil foe also the fairies were pretty cool and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism they were high tech and armed with laser guns unfortunately the author put artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz now let me rewiew this particular book its a horrible read who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts no me now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd i mean seriously a barbie doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they re boys how old is the author anyways two years old well obviously he s not married thats for sure i always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds not four year olds anyways enough of that the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father i read colfer because he writes futuristic books that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn t even solve robberies instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war all of the wicked humor is lost there is no action whatsoever the main charecter isn t a genius with wicked humor and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others heavily downgraded adn obviously the worst parts do not even read this thing get some other artemis fowl books or read alex rider thats a very good read,negative
these are true tales from a clinical neurologist s notebook but this isn t just any neurologist oliver sacks author of the justly celebrated the man who mistook his wife for a hat \( 1986 \) and awakenings \( 1973 \) which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams and other works is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating yet studiously objective a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations historical comparisons and wisdom part of the power of these tales and of all of sacks s work is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality this makes for a compelling read if you ve never read sacks before you are in for a very special treat these tales are paradoxical because defects disorders diseases can bring out latent powers developments evolutions forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence it is this creative potential that forms the central theme of this book \( from sacks s preface page xvi \) the first tale the case of the colorblind painter is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty five and the effect this had on his life and work the second the last hippie is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties sacks tells this sad pathetic story with vivid detail and characteristically ends it with a footnote a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears \( don t skip the footnotes \) the third tale a surgeon s life is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette s syndrome it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination dr carl bennett riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder compulsions that cause him to throw things to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner to flail jump and jerk about nonetheless became a very successful \( and beloved \) doctor of surgery sacks scrubs up with dr bennett and goes into surgery with him during which miraculously the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be the fourth tale to see and not see is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination in the fifth tale the landscape of his dreams we meet a gifted artist franco magnani who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito italy through his paintings he has a nearly photographic three dimensional memory but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty one he cares only to re create his pontito not the people or events but the houses the masonry the stones and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail the chapter prodigies focuses on an autistic artist stephen wiltshire whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand in this tale and the concluding tale an anthropologist on mars sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it \( at least in my interpretation \) as an alternate view of reality a view with its own strengths and weaknesses a world that is just as true and valid as the normal one of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society yet perhaps that is society s loss i even got the sense in reading these concluding stories about autism that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary strategy trying to emerge that is a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness and that humankind is the better for it incidentally the last tale about temple grandin who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society yet remains autistic she is the one who says she sometimes feels because of her different perspective like an anthropologist on mars when she views normal people sacks allows us to see why bottom line this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition written with grace and a deep sense of humanity not to be missed,positive
although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa i find this book difficult to understand the difficulty seems to come from the authors desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages this leads to a cryptic language where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words a thing which personally frustrated me,negative
the author is an owner and operator of a tutoring center he is not an expert in auto mechanics as he points out on the back cover the pictures and the concepts were for teenage boys and the accompanying graphics are of poor quality if you actually want to learn anything substative of autos this is a poor poor choice you are better of visiting the automotive section of www howstuffworks com or some similar website to learn more with better graphics and for free i bought this book long time ago and finally had the time to look at it and i regret it,negative
i think this is the best book that i have ever read i thought that the civil war was very very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye each character has a different story of the war and of life i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn this book was excellent from the first page i read even though this novel is very brilliant some people might not like it if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz he had the funniest voice i ever heard when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too trust me before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really really new to me i had to get use to it a little but since it wasn t very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story in the story he sounds like he s from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and doesn t talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart,positive

tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author \( tim cohen \) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen s the real rapture \( based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series \( see prophecy house s web site for details on these items \),negative

i too have an ma in american history and i was never given reason to think about each of two questions raised by this important book firstly and fundamentally what was the timetable by which the british military were expected to leave the former colonies and second what property could they take with them especially as property had a very particular meaning here in the new nation was the revolution in large part fought to maintain slavery that surely bears on the problematic nature of our constitution the wonderfully gifted writer and historian \( would that they were always the same thing \) poses these vital questions and we are fortunate that the near simultaneous publication of david b davis inhuman bondage complements this fine effort so as one reviewer suggests it is in some ways an overwritten period but schama and davis add something new and exciting to the dialogue my thanks,positive
as a follower of the celebration story for many years i was greatly disappointed by what i thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town it was nothing of the sort the book had the feel of so many pages of anti disney propaganda and the repetitiveness of a bad serial the authors of celebration u s a clearly made up their minds about celebration long before signing off on a mortgage lacking in the detail needed to illustrate celebration s experiment with the tenets of neotraditional style the book offered splashes of cliched generalities such as a return to the past and recapturing tradition it soon became some sort of mantra exhorting disney s ownership of the town the rules imposed on property improvements and maintenance and interestingly the attention the town received most tactless of all was the shadow of mockery cast on every description of residents conversation with neighbors and interaction with people doing what the authors should have been doing giving the town a chance,negative
i love mr koontz and have long read his novels watchers intensity odd thomas and so on but this was dissappointing not to mention just plain depressing and come on with the corny slap stick banter between the characters okay okay we know the 9 year old leilani has a high iq but really she speaks like a 50 year old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence these characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into therefore i put it down after 350 pages of this twattle koontz has done much better in the past lastly let s keep dogs out of your next few novels please it s getting a bit old how about a smart cat or raven for your next novel maybe mixed with some more down to earth folks that speak like real people do,negative
i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times,negative
i was very disapointed in the book basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others twisted their words and put his own spin on it it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down there are good books out there written by people who were there i suggest you take a look at those i read many good one s but this book wasnt in that catagory,negative

i will not lash out against anyone and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious ostentatious egotism that said let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth s solutions extremely difficult to accept first off it doesn t do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus s morals in general terms if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus s codices the key point here is that jesus s older analects were deluded enough his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale jesus s peuplade appears to be growing in number i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations circumvent any further litigation and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death all by trumping up a phony emergency his desire to control your bank account your employment your personal safety and your mind is the chief sign that he s a slaphappy caitiff \( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo treatment to cure my problem \) perhaps i m reading too much into jesus s ravings but they don t seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests jesus s pr cis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent noxious feudalism that s pretty transparent what s not so transparent is the answer to the following question does jesus s oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities a clue might be that every time he tries jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought but for imagination as well jesus s eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing \( remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil \) jesus of nathareth has an agenda a political social and cultural agenda and that s all i have to say,negative
i bought this audio cd set at the borders store without the opportunity to preview the narration had i been able to do so i probably never would have purchased it let alone paid full bookstore price for it but i needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day so i relented lesson learned the audio quality is very insonsistent at at times very poor having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording while the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the middle east it does read very much like a history text with the amount of detail presented and the wide scope of coverage from one end of europe reaching into the former soviet states and beyond one immediately feels the need for visual aids \( maps timelines etc \) as guidance the reader s narration is monotononous with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses each sentence sounds the same as the last this has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity after a while the narration becomes little more than background noise no information is retained by the listener,negative
immediately upon starting dickens our mutual friend i was struck by parallels with dumas the count of monte cristo both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice the count deals with the darker theme of revenge our mutual friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth the novel is lively throughout as dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents the tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper class politics and antisemitism to delicate romance to witty visual humor the characterizations are highly original even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies most impressive to me was the consistency of dickens plot our mutual friend was written and published in installments as was the count of monte cristo but dickens keeps his story on track throughout never dropping a character while dumas tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies,positive
i m about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing i kept thinking maybe it s me maybe there s something wrong with my attention span that i lose interest in these stories half way thru they all seem too long unfocussed what they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories the quality puzzles me because i m almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf i read in the zines i haven t followed this anthology over the years but this particular edition imho shows bad selection and worse editing,negative
stephen king has written another attention grabber i read and listened as i have both the paperback and the audio book i found this book great as it follows both the imaginary and the real sides of life i found that as i read the book i really would like to visit the library that is described in the book this book follows down a strange path emerging in what could almost be explained as a real story of fact in the past i recommend this novel and the audio book as the narrator does a great job it will not dissapoint as everything s eventual did in my opinion good luck and good reading \( note the audio version of this book is narrated by frank muller anyone who has listened to stephen king audio books has sure to have been wowwed by frank muller in this audio book recording frank muller s voice is almost unrecognizable and amazing as he plays this roll frank muller and audio books are truly like movies for your mind \),positive
a useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing accounting standards and approaches between countries however it is not worth the price it is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students it is more suitable for general second year accounting students plus as i am working with a multinational european bank in japan the book is rapidly becoming out of date there is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries,negative
i just got through reading harvey penick s little red book i enjoyed it so much that i had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller s feedback page but the book was that enjoyable i read the book because i was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals i don t even play golf i was able to apply harvey penick s words to attitudes and approaches to life though he not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one s life his methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me he refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings instead he accentuates the positive he educates by guiding his students instead of teaching them i love his ability to teach with images parables and metaphors his chapter first things first about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great after all the problem is not always what you think i challenge anyone to read harvey penick s little red book and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives whether you play golf or not this book is good reading,positive

as a young woman i was appauled by gurian s lack of respect for women as human beings what makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in life the resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional roles i don t remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness gurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his tricks his book is full of agenda,negative

need i say more than the above title suggests okay so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience there are some touching moments in this book but even then there is still something the author is lacking i saw the movie when it was in theatres and i have just finished reading the book i liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book the movie was funny entertaining touching personal and sad at times the book did not captivate me at all i had trouble staying focused considering beverly donofrio s credentials a bachelor s degree in english from wesleyan university and a master of fine arts in creative writing her quality of writing is very poor her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education if even that and not to go off topic but since donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like columbia u then why doesn t she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life i mean after all the mfa is in creative writing meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time she has only wrote 2 books riding in cars with boys and looking for mary both about her getting pregnant at a young age if you liked the movie just leave it at that don t bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed and if you re interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy then go to the local library don t get this one there s other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one,negative
thankfully this is not littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies the hallmarks of 99 of the latest and greatest business books especially since it was written in 1999 moore s is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high tech industry he was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005 the book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation i help run an online software development company and although it isn t exactly high tech i still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of it fascinating market shifts are demanding broadband wireless internet everywhere free companies are shifting towards web basing software applications all very relevant to my business the book is well written an easy and moderately fast read and very accessible by anyone who is technology savvy enough to at least hold an email address yes buy it buy the paperback and save money short synopsis in the infancy of a market products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno geeks nothing new here when a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority where the biggest money sits it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so the emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive tailored product that meets all of their needs create the whole product by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together then stop tweaking the product if that works pick related niches and go after them the same way creating the whole product for each of them once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market \( this all deals with new high tech changes \) and start doing so en masse the strategy must completely shift again to a ship first fix the product later mentality in a mad market share scramble at this phase you are in the tornado lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone at each stage mentioned above,positive
oh how i wanted to love devon s book he was such a charming rascal in wicked and such a bore in sinful there was no meat to this story the back of the books summarizes it nicely what would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages i admit i only made through about half before skimming and realizing it wasn t going to get any better there s no sizzling tension the love scenes weak and the mystery is predictable i had such high expectations for this boscastle book since drake s was brilliant and devon s character seemed such a lovable rogue not a keeper for me,negative

as mentioned this book is amazingly compact cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages that conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing the authors mention in the preface that classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof for those with a serious interest in mathematics this is a useful resource for most others the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff included with the book is a one page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information including common rules for derivatives and integrals geometric formulas a few conversion factors trigonometric identities and graphs \( very useful \) and more the book also has a three page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased european males who made calculus possible given all of this i would highly recommend this book as an 800 page calculus reference text or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters then using it saves you money but for those who don t have a super strong background or interest in math those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before or for those who are just plain math phobic using this book just doesn t make any sense i wouldn t recommend it for those who are stuck with this book for a course i d suggest looking for another book to help you out one possible book has already been mentioned in another review silvanus thompson and martin gardner s calculus made easy a book that dates back originally to 1910 \( \) i ve read parts of it and the book looks good to me i m sure that there are many other helpful books try checking your local university library or looking on amazon for ideas an extra calculus textbook that s more student friendly might be a good idea as for the pages falling out i haven t had a problem with it \( i have the 8th edition \) but i don t use the book all that much i haven t found any serious errors in the text but i haven t read everything thoroughly having only used the text for calc iii and yeah getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea,positive
this book reads like a horror novel by allowing her dogs \( as well as another one in her care \) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals welfare not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps oh and let s not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author s choice not to spay and neuter her animals this book moves at a peppy pace and might have been interesting \( albeit morally reprehensible \) if the author s observations actually provided any insight but those eighteen wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author s whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence case in point she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one s litter of puppies oops any genuine dog lover \( or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense \) will despise this book a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head if feelings are your road map to life you might enjoy this book if you regularly take your brain out for walk forget it calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling jonathan livingston seagull the definitive text on marine fowl,negative
children love to follow instructions step by step and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep drag on for hours any adult who cooks like this doesn t cook often cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen for example who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter melts it in a pan then pours it into a \( plastic microwave safe \) mixing bowl great now there s a pan a knife and a cutting board to wash it is a children s cookbook so why not cut down on time spent with knives stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave nice pictures large font recipes are great but \( in my opinion \) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen not a home,negative

a refreshing look on software development and the many pitfalls you need to avoid this book should be read by everybody involved in any software project but the simplest in my opinion a standard work nevertheless it needs to be handled with care during ages sw development managers have tried convincing their people to break out of the chaos and plan their work this book correctly warns for the opposite effects of believing that planning solves everything some people might however read between the lines that no planning at all is the best practice the book confirms what i and my successful colleagues found through experience and intuition there is an optimal point of planning upfront less harms because you don t know where you are going more \( too detailed \) harms because it takes away flexibility and it slows you down significantly new to me was the use of queuing theory to point out what we see every day too many features under resourcing leads to far bigger delays than human mind can ever guess,positive

i love this book it s beautiful this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly causing the ruckus with all the animals the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and therefore may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend the pigs in the muck the kittens in the hayloft the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming s gorgeous art each time my nine month old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter this is definitely one of his favorites i highly recommend this book,positive

this book is a very good study into what happen to the lost ten tribes of israel mr capt did a great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the assyrians which is called the house of omri this book is very in depth and very informative i also noticed a person left one star because mr capt did say anything about the jews of course the jew s wouldn t be metioned they weren t taken into exile until 586 bce and that was by babylonia and not assyria when reading about the ten tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not jews over all i give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid bible reader intrested in research,positive

after reading a fine balance i couldn t wait to read another book by this author i then read his third book called family matters which was good but i was disappointed as it by no means compared to a fine balance i just finished such a long journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots it is my least favorite of the three books by this author it s hard to believe that someone can right a book like a fine balance which was magnificant and one of the best books i have ever read and then turn our stuff that is at best average,negative
this is the second book in the wind dancer series the wind dancer being the first which was excellent i almost feel as if i liked storm winds even more than the wind dancer and i believe it s due to a more comprehensive abundance of history i was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book from the first chapter until the last one the characters were very individualistic and intriguing i have to say i enjoyed the romance more between the two supporting characters catherine and francois more than the main characters juliette and jean marc i was enamored by francois and his strength steeliness and sensuality jean marc was a dark handsome man as well because of the way juliette was treated in her youth i see why she was so desperate for someone to need her hence her demanding take charge attitude to care for her friend and others catherine was a delight she was soft caring and sweet but her terrible experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature fascinating characters and historical background i would recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn t the typical dull harlequin type and a love for important historical eras,positive
save your time money and patience this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous predictable stone barrington novel the short forever wow this one stinks like others i put up with the shallow characters ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers boobs and guns to figure out whodunit unfortunately this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid who on earth did kill vance and come to think of it who gives a damn i don t what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt every female character save for isabel the maid felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb vacuous self centered and thoroughly unlikeable hey a couple are even truly psychotic the only normal female character who spared stone mary ann unfortunately has a room temperature iq i am hardly a prude but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth mr woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought,negative

this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms story and it s hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale the king threatens to kill the miller s daughter if she can t spin gold from straw rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her but extracts a necklace a ring and on the third night of spinning a promise of her firstborn she then marries the king whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name so the king though he looks good is greedy and brutal the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life and then depends on an anonymous unrecognized servant girl to save the child and rumpelstiltskin shown as physically unattractive and \( the message seems to be \) therefore bad is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for a weird twisted story that offers nothing for kids illustrated with renaissance style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad,negative
april of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved america but april of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so it was during this time that washington dc sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession once virginia did leave the union only maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best abraham lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on general winfield scott for his part scott was keenly aware of the danger facing washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to dc quickly from loyal northern states the problem was that these militia units would have to travel through maryland a slave state that might well consider these yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty it was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of maryland but also ultimately by the state militia in the meantime virginia forces had seized the federal armory at harper s ferry and the gosport navy yard near hampton virginia rumors are rampant in dc that the virginia militia that had taken harper s ferry was preparing to move on washington and many in the federal city were in a state of panic the questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether washington dc was ever in any real danger did the confederacy in fact lose it s only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period david detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner this book reads much like a great historical drama and the author s writing style is superbly readable it is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome detzer has accomplished this however and although i was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn i had a tough time putting the book down this invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of american history no hero of american history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even ben butler is praised when his actions merit it this is the story of those fateful days of april and may of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author this book is well researched very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the pennsylvania militia it is a story upon which the fate of the united states once turned,positive

i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively that is about the only positive aspect of this book the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable sara s family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family sara s twin sister gets all the attention and love leaving sara starving for parental care finally christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone i wasted my time with this book please don t waste yours,negative

susanna rowson s charlotte temple is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman poor pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings charlotte temple was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now charlotte temple has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary in the past twenty years feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati authors such as anne plumptre frances burney aphra behn sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries unfortunately rowson does not warrant such treatment rowson has a flat humorless approach to the fallen woman story unlike burney s evelina or camilla rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity her pedantic iron fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates in many of the fallen women stories authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man in england and america it was not considered altogether lady like to read a novel so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed rowson does not criticize men within the novel she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend s mistress he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting dishonorable against her yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her she would not have been reduced to a penniless pregnant ex mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte s downfall rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it instead rowson places the blame for charlotte s ruin on the women within the novel when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue madame du pont sets charlotte s downfall in action rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville charlotte elopement miss la rue the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville must be punished for being a promiscuous woman she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women why would modern readers want to read this i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel at 125 pages it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace no character has any shadings there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte rowson does nothing to keep our interest unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best selling novel that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia but it does not make for engaging reading,negative
i m a big nora fan but i couldn t even finish this one by the fourth chapter i began to skim way way way to much detail for me which made it boring and slow testing and corrosion is it fake is it real blah blah blah enough i did however enjoy the side story about the brother \( i forget his name \) but thats it folks unlike all the other reviewers i hated it i say pass on this one but as you can see i m in the minority,negative
you get your money s worth here there are a ton of cds in this audio book unfortunately i found bryson s prose \( which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently as i have done with his other books \) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud to me he sounds kind of affected in parts and sometimes there is a sort of moist sound when he pronounces words hard to describe until you hear the cd but trust me on this one i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book and not the cd i would stick with the written word on this one,negative

i agree with some of the negative reviews that the junie b jones books often use language and depict behavior that are less than desirable my son who is a pretty sensitive boy didn t like junie b jones because he thought she was rude i would much prefer that my kids read books with kids who though they may get in trouble from time to time or may make mistakes are generally nice people we did love the magic tree house series both for the adventure and the personalities of jack and annie,negative
i really like this series of books that range from this storage one to bathrooms family houses etc but i am giving this book a 4 because it shows alot of houses that seem to be beyond the means of most people that i know around my area this book also likes to tell you to build storage in every little crack space that does not currently have something useful going for it i am giving it 4 stars because it does inform you of all of the different types of devices that are currently \( as of the book being published \) available to help you make storage possible in nooks and crannies it also gives you ideas and suggestions about how you can make more use out of the storage that you already have by redesigning the shelving to make it more attractive also try not to read it all at once though because i started to gloss over stuff just to get to the end of the book take it a step at a time and it will be a great start for you,positive

myths are important but they should not be labeled history 1 george washington was not a great guerilla leader he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines just like the redcoats washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops 2 ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear disarming of the soviet union eisenhower and kennedy tried but \( lbj \) nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe but the big nukes that could end civilization were already being cut back this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan but some of the history cited is wrong,negative
it s hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout truly basic and nothing new here spend your money elsewhere,negative

good but it simply wasn t actionous enough i don t mind having no action in a book \( otherwise how else could i love foundation so much \) but children was a book that needed to have action in it unfortunately it didn t really too much philosophical babble that i had to re read to get it slightly reminiscent of card s later shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue too much about jane not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about ender which annoyed me to my shock ender s death did not really impact me in any way beyond huh wait ender is dead so little was his role in the book he probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether edit from now on i am never giving a book that i halfway like two stars again because each time i receive the urge to change my rating to three stars just keep in mind that while it says two it means three,negative
the first novel of laurell k hamilton s merry gentry series is not actually that terrible a book it s by far the best in a not particularly great series actually what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise the set up is one of the most grotesquely ridiculously stupid things i ve ever read princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie in fear of death at the hands of her aunt andais the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court high profile fae in this world are major public figures like rock stars or the royal family of england the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed every news media in the world reports the story and it never goes away we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings meredith s image the story of her mysterious disappearance is everywhere i mean neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is and what she looks like meanwhile princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye thing is she hasn t disguised herself very much at all her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin her fae red hair is now human red hair her facial features remain the same and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith for years on end no one recognizes her let me hasten to add there is no magic involved in this they honestly simply don t recognize her and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she s actually princess meredith is wait for it merry gentry jesus wept and for years none of her co workers no one who knows her says to themself hey wait a minute that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith merry gentry princess meredith oh my god merry gentry is princess meredith nope she s just incognito baby at which point i almost threw down the book and said you have got to be kidding me it s absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process do laurell hamilton s editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing given her past six or eight novels including this one i m tempted to say no actually,negative
i am a huge john grisham fan i believe the first grisham book i ever read was the pelican brief after that i was hooked i admit that through the years mr grisham s work has become less grishamisc and not as entertaining as earlier works but you ll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does i first started this book by listening to it on cd i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it i was right the book starts out with action and pulls you in the action barely lets up through the entire book this is a different kind of action more mental than physical there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works is that there isn t really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve generally we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending however in this book it is more of a life lesson about greed there is no bad guy nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character etc the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life the characters are likeable and easy to follow there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story i found the book very easy to read and follow i always wanted more although the book has a different theme than most grisham books i still really enjoyed it it reminded me why i like to read his books so much it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending if you like this one try the eariler works as well if you have seen the movies it doesn t matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way this book would make a good movie but we ll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point happy reading,positive
this was the first collin wilson book i read he has probably read a lot to write this book but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about if you are interested in this matter \( the occult knowledge \) as something you would read about but never ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything maybe this book is ok but if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake please stay away from this book he is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation,negative
i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti i found the subject interesting and the professor gave wonderful lectures i had good expectations about this book going in but those quickly soured as i read it it seems correct at least about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock not that such is a particularly daunting feet however it is rife with laughable fallacies for instance it calls david bowie amongst other glam rock bands of the era metal it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all such as the carpenters i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs for instance it claims thunder rolls by garth brooks is about domestic violence its about infedility not focusing on violence at all but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on the writing is also rather dry many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band s successes or failures after reading the book in completetion i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues \( 50s to 60s \) that i had thought were true in the end i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything,negative
my husband is icelandic and unfortunately this book was no help at all it s perfectly fine for the traveller but in trying to live everyday life conversing with new family members forget it i would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand if you are quite serious about learning this language i would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive colloquial icelandic for me at least it s quite easier to understand has complete grammatical charts in the back as well as a fairly decent dictionary again if you are only learning for business trips and such then this would be a good option for those of us actually moving there her book is not so good,negative
i am vietnamese and i grew up in new orleans during the 80 s and 90 s when the first waves were settling down there i hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people the vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards uneducated and simple further the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success if you actually grew up in new orleans during the time that the vietnamese americans were setting root during the 80 s and 90 s you would know that by and large the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful no real vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book i repeat no vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book the book repeats many of the fallacies that i have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about east asian culture there always seems to be 1 \) an asian prostitute 2 \) caucasian guy with asian bride 3 \) asian male in an emasculated role 4 \) asian people as backwards and simple quite sad this book reminds me quite a bit of memoirs of a geisha though that portrayed japanese culture in a better light by the way the lady on which memoirs of a geisha is based and written about was quite upset at the author of memoirs of a geisha and did not feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at all regardless if you really want to find out about the vietnamese american experience you should really read a book written by a vietnamese american,negative

dr amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family the stigma associated with mental illness is deep seated and difficult to overcome understanding the root causes particularly the genetic predisposition within families is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life long problems these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse they do not deal with the biological root causes once those are dealt with the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life however without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch take my advice if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar get help as recommended you will become a new person the one you were created to be and that is a wonderful thing,positive
a well researched look at aviation that reminded me of the novels of nevil shute my favorite chapter was friday norton qa 11 50am a perfect description of the working methods of a certain veteran tv newsman who just retired at age 88 of course there are plot holes the heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards but as the jeopardy increases the guards aren t there no followup mention what happened to them some vulgarity in language but all in all a great fun read,positive
as far as style goes i found this pretty boring from what i saw in the bookstore glad i never bought it races of eberron is much better as it has three great races \( fourth isn t so hot \) including one living construct type in fact from races of eberron i made one changeling druid who has near complete cold adaptation and heat adaptation \( from environment series \) and a warforged monk which was effective against lycanthropes what can races of the dragon possibly give you flying creatures firebreathing creatures you could be better off with weaked down angel or better yet just a birdfolk race \( like raptorans in races of the wild which by the way also has more variety with its catfolk \) as for firebreathing a feat could probably give you the whole fire eating fire blowing act and save you the whole freakish thing of having weird blood,negative

i was really looking forward to reading ever after when i saw the favorable quote on the back cover by larry gelbart but the book turned out to be a very cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight here are the three things i learned from this book \( 1 \) mega musicals are almost always artistically corrupt \( 2 \) andrew lloyd webber is the anti christ \( 3 \) the only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started off broadway \( mostly at playwrights horizons and lincoln center \) most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each with very few illuminating details here s what the author says about carrie perhaps the most famous recent broadway musical flop carrie of course was an instant classic a monument in the pantheon of failed broadway musicals adapated by michael gore \( music \) and don pitchford \( lyrics \) from the notorious stephen king novel \( and even more notorious film \) this 7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the virginia theater on the 12th of may 1988 and was gone by the 15th touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible monumental ineptitude does that really tell us very much about this musical did barry singer even see the show you sure wouldn t know it from this description and just what i wonder makes king s novel notorious or the movie even more notorious almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention but somehow singer finds time for an entire chapter of lloyd webber bashing where sir andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery the chapter sticks out like a sore thumb if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book but also because it s one of the few times that singer goes into any detail aside from a few interesting sondheim quotes this book is a waste of time,negative
as a fan of gitlin i was hoping that he d give me the bottom line his bottom line on the air we breathe today the same way that brave souls such as lasch marcuse and bell have done but gitlin isn t brave he admits honestly up front that he will reach few conclusions and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets on tv and on the net what follows is a stream of consciousness depiction of life today i want more than that from gitlin i want his conclusions not some lame statement that he hasn t reached any yet he s not getting any younger lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives it s time for his masterpiece the next book perhaps,negative
by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers and was struck by the similarities and differences it s a great compare and contrast pair as an exercise for high schoolers both are written as first person accounts by teen aged girls and are roughly contemporary heart published in 1940 and castle in 1948 both about life in the 30s both families are poor in castle though there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs this is supposedly because they don t know how to do anything so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter how charming they are eccentric which seems enough in the author s eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper enamored of cassandra does work and gives the family his entire salary but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all even he is rewarded in the end able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step mum topaz striking poses unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark educated folks playing at being poor until they re rescued by romantic circumstance not so in america where mick kelly who didn t know how to do anything either went off to work at woolworth s and to a life of little hope in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina the inheritance two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle show up just in time with their chatty modern mum they throw money around and talk too much in the cliched extravagant american style most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being it s all so very charming bourgeois and harmless if your life is hard don t worry a man will show up to rescue you the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive smith was obviously talented her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition,negative
the climb was written by bourkeev and dewalt as an answer to krakaur s into thin air while not showcasing the same prose as krakaur s book i feel that this is utlamitely better my reasoning for this opinion is that the climb seems like a much more fair and unbiased account bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game he simply tells the story as he experienced it krakaur it seemed to me at least relied to heavily on assumptions and we all now what happens when you assume \( hint you make an out of you and me \) and came off as very arrogant and \( for some reason \) took a feverious dislike to bourkeev and lopsang thought not as well written as into thin air the climb still managed to draw me in fully although some parts of the book are a little confusing mainly the interview with bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed this interview was conducted in english the only problem with that is that bourkeev s english is not very strong it is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper dewalt tries to help by adding translations about what bourkeev is saying but i felt the interview should have been caried out in bourkeev s native tongue of russian and then translated into english to not have done this is a great injustice to bourkeev if you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the may 1996 everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money \( as krakaur s clearly was \) read this i really recommend you read both books though and also check out the imax movie everest,positive
this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths and underlying the story are indeed echoes sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted of ancient myths god is allegorized as gabalawi the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel the second that of moses and pharaoh the third that of jesus the fourth that of muhammad then there is a fifth story in which the central figure a magician is presumably a scientist he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi who had been easier to kill than to see it makes no difference the scientist who has invented a weapon of great destructive power is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever though they remain hopeful that one day magic will put an end to their suffering subtle the book is not either in content or in style and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent they mostly shout scream shriek yell cry or sneer which becomes rather tiresome the literary quality of this novel is i think greatly inferior to mahfouz s rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written it has been banned in egypt its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author s life,negative

this is the author s presentation of the satipatthana sutra the basic sutra on mindfullness as in all of his works he does the work of a good dharma teacher very well he keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student s understanding can arise naturally there are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the sutra in meditation but this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks the author gives a good commentary on the sutra and explains why he translates certain passages but he also gives the alternate interpretations this is a fine basic introduction to the central issue in vapassana meditation highly recommended,positive
the story is about peter growing up with his family in north dublin and is set in the 1960 s the tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers which his parents took in to supplement his father s income forms the backdrop to his story at 44 seville place the pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties the short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up beat throughout the whole of the book for those who have experienced dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time the metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed one example of this technique was when peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother frankie before frankie goes into surgery a joy to read da is the sun and all the minor planets revolve around him peter takes to his role as mercury the messenger with great relish there is a strong bond between father and son i feel this story should not be compared to frank mccourt s angela s ashes a one generation step into the future in ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced it was a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced however there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not be silenced,positive
this book is pretty much useless if you re looking for info on how to build a dulcimer only about 60 pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making repair the rest is a long winded history bio of homer ledford some of that is a bit interesting from an historical cultural perspective but the author beats it to death homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer the rest was the author s idea dean kimball s book on dulcimer making is better although still lacking in some areas this book has no patterns or plans few useful photos and is weak in what instruction it does provide there are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book,negative

i have never been a big fan of motivational books because they seem so pie in the sky if you know what i mean but a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different he was right it was easy to read and in fact i didn t want to put it down but what i really liked was the how to part of the book after all it s no good reading about other people s success stories if you don t know how to make your own also something i thought was interesting is that the author has a website called success compass which helps you set goals and then e mails you a reminder several times a day i guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want and this website doesn t let you forget hmmmmm electronic nagging as the key to success \) hey whatever works,positive

i recently decided to become vegetarian so i got this book to read i was very disapointed i think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals yet is written in a boring scientific way this book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians than to teenagers this book contains a lot of recipies and some of them sound good but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook i would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians but there are better books written for the teens themself this book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu i don t think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians there is enough of that without reading about it however if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won t hurt it is just a dissapointment,negative
communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history responsible for the extermination of 100 million people this book \( which started it all \) holds at least much of the blame communists were and still are a threat to the free world and communism is a slave system some intellectuals actually support the tired mantras of marx s philosophy whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven t seen enough sunlight i don t know in any case if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property and is totalitarian and slave driving \( the government owns everything including you \) and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up pol pot mao stalin \( of course \) etc etc who are these people kidding,negative

before i bought the pasajes series i was relieved to see the \( then \) mostly positive reviews however i really feel like the overall review score of 4 5 stars is very very misleading i would not in good faith be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish 1 \) the concepts are not clearly explained \( they invented a new english word for one \) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary concepts to feel confident using them 2 \) frequently new words phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else via a footnote with no further explaination provided this is super frustrating and distracting 3 \) using this series of books is very cumbersome the books are not well coordinated with one another and do not appear to reinforce each other s concepts or vocabulary i m very sorry but these books are just terrible and 4 5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish which i used to enjoy if you have the option to use different books take it,negative
i did not read the book but i did look it over carefully i was hoping it would be a clear step by step guide to using ibd to apply the canslim method there is so much information in the paper that it is not easy to apply all the techniques in an efficient manner there are almost too many choices and directions possible this book is not a step by step guide nor is it all that clear i did find it to be unnecessarily wordy and vague it just seems to go over the whole paper in a long winded fashion but does not get down to the nuts and bolts of smart investing as i was hoping it would refer to william o neil s books for better guidance about how to invest also if you are a subscriber there is a large amount of useful information on the ibd website at investors com,negative

in this book dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history he focuses primarily on the catholic church from dulles analysis there are five basic ways to understand the church he explores how these models have been used over time as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses in the rest of the book dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology he has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five my only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models the book is helpful however to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church it is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church all things considered this book is an asset to pastors students and anyone involved in ministry,positive

apparently the difference between a criminal act \( theft \) and moral redistribution of income is 1 \) who you steal from \( stealing from the wealthy of course is moral according to rawls and bolsheviks \) and 2 \) who receives the loot \( the non wealthy makes it moral \) and 3 \) who commits the act \( the state society of course also makes theft moral example taxation \) and 4 \) your intentions \( redistribution of income \) to look at this another way if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money that s a crime \( unless your neighbor is poor which would then be moral and justice according to rawls formula \) if the community comes into your house and steals from you it s legal and moral justice again according to rawls because according to rawls if before you were born you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured you d vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal or they would be compensated somehow for being born \( unjustly \) less equal how by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more so those with more would be like oh say a milk cow who gets milked to serve those with less so those with more would become a resource or state owned slaves to those with less because society \( the robin hoods and rawls of the world \) deemed this as moral justice rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk entrepreneurs students of life who work to earn an a vs students who earn an f he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own true but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference forcing the wealthier ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn t justice or moral it would simply be an unjust law some people see rawls theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia \( like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism \) i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery and a powerful dis incentive for earning personal reward and merit in a sense this book is an argument against the individual it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people he doesn t recognize any individuals \( unless they were born as victims \) curious how do you experience life as a group mind \( an oxymoron if there ever was one \) a collective or as a unique isolated independent individual there should be societal incentives to help each other okay but when it is forced \( theft of property always implies force \) it is no longer an issue of morality or justice it s simply a law without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue by definition transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom,negative
as a history major \( undergrad \) and former high school history teacher i marvel at crichton s ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way for this reason the great train robbery is for me my favorite crichton work even though it may lack the polish of jurassic park or congo or one of his more recent books tgtr takes us to 19th century london and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery as well as life in general in 19th century london so often history books give names dates connections but leave one with the question yes but what was it like crichton answers this better than any book i ever read on the sheep enclosure act or most any other dry text some of it may be fanciful but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text at any rate i highly recommend this book for any crichton fan master criminal fan or interested history student the main character whose name escapes me alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a hugo or dumas novel very fascinating and rapidly moving,positive

horror stories piece when bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom his next words were half hour into the flight i need to suggest that don and mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad the words after should were bleeped out by a msnbc exec which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about savage s sexual orientation savage asked if he was a sodomite to which the caller answered yes savage then said to the caller oh so you re one of those sodomites you should only get aids and die you pig how s that why don t you see if you can sue me you pig you got nothing better to do than to put me down you piece of garbage you got nothing better to do today go eat a

on no more calls i don t care about these bums they mean nothing to me they re all sausages 6 before the show was canceled msnbc was replaying his show during primetime hours saturday night many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments and that msnbc was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups others point out

i m a big koontz fan and as is generally the case i greatly enjoyed this story it was a little strange but that s to be expected from this author and genre that said it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book it had the curious sense of near division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not in my opionion as well connected as in many of koontz s other books in addition the ending seemed a little hasty thus i gave it four rather than five stars that said i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author s work,positive
the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into leadership by calling and comparisons to it with modern leadership theory les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion a point with which i agree unfortunately some of the examples he chooses are questionable after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack \( which jack says he would abandon if needed \) while still making the tough decisions that got the results for the shareholders jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results ok also there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home unfortunately the theme in csorba s examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance it s a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work it started off so well it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust able leader unfortunately this conservative political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it they would simply say its a bush ie right winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise too bad csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual i say this even though i am republican am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election am a person of faith and tend to find the dems an easy target but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics too bad,negative

to cover all the problems with continuity logic theology geography and plain common sense in left behind would take a whole book one hardly knows where to start perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel as such it isn t even a decent trashy novel instead of steamy sex scenes we get sanctimonious sermonizing worse than that what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it s too late the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario \( an idea with virtually no scriptural support \) little in the characters actions thought processes or dialog rings true one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student god ends up looking like the ultimate villain demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear who is the present day equivalent of c s lewis or catherine marshall and why aren t they getting more attention these were writers who actually made you think lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non believers in such a world might ask one wonders if they have ever met a non believer at all or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter these days it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted bigoted caricature of what it once was perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured if left behind is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind,negative

a generation before there was a left behind there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c c carlson this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america a phemomenal best seller it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry for many christians their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future a generation later many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism well while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other prophecy pundits while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form for lahaye and jerry b jenkins it was the pulp novel back in 1970 lindsay and c c carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day the sensationalistic expose like most books of this type \( e g the bermuda triangle chariots of the gods the philadelphia experiment the population bomb \) it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts like most of these books it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams like most of these books it is laughable in retrospect if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong after all it was the 1970 s when wild conspiracy theories distrust of any traditional authority and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age a ufo invasion a famine around the corner and california falling into the pacific ocean the authors claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy however in the intervening years the revisions of this book just kept piling up make a bad prediction no problem edit the book with the old gaffes removed add a few trendier predictions and release it as a new book lindsey now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis \( carleton s contribution is more stylistic \) despite his failed scenarios lindsey s original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s \( he even wrote a book the 1980 s countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief \) well that didn t pan out so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon \( another of his books was planet earth 2000 a d will mankind survive \) oops wrong again first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam \( a more recent book is the everlasting hatred the roots of jihad \) when one bogeyman falls he is quick to insert a new one in its place between the failed predictions the hilarious misreadings of the original languages the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies right before our eyes it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs notably the left behind series of novels if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night however for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy it is best to pass for all its success as a cultural marker its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil for this its original purpose the late great planet earth is completely worthless,negative
despite the fact that hanegraaff s name is the bigger of the two on the front cover only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading and they are the writing of paul maier his research is helpful but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn t given a week end to write it and come up with as much as he could every topic needs futher information a lot more could be said and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere that said i would give this book to someone who isn t much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions it isn t much more than a collection of scattered soundbites but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction,negative
i love this book it is a terrific blend of hand holding and concrete advice for writers each chapter takes the writer reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write how do we begin where do ideas come from is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin i like the fact that i could use this book as a resource in other words i did not have to read it cover to cover rather it truly serves as a guide a mentor s guide that can serve me as i continue to write i really liked the movie section where cathleen rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process i found those sections inspirational and useful if you want to be a writer or if you are already writing i urge you to buy this book,positive

this story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing it clearly establishes a sense of time and place \( modern day madison wisconsin \) and offers the promise of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of als \( lou gehrig s disease \) from the perspective of a personal caregiver while we learn to understand the struggles of the patient kate this is more about the struggles of a college student known as bec as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own author michelle wildgen fulfills the promise this story is character driven and what made me turn the pages wasn t the story which was at times a bit slow and uninspiring with the exception of the blue butterfly the additional sex scenes felt extraneous further one can guess from the beginning that in terms of kate s condition there wouldn t be a happy ending regardless wildgen paints a very realistic picture of als and definitely puts you in the room what made me turn the pages was wildgen s ability to make each of her characters come alive i cared about them and wanted to see how they d handle kate s progressive and ultimate demise bec is the narrator who learns as she goes \( both how to take care of kate and how to cook for her guests staff family \) we see everything through her eyes particularly as she becomes kate s voice the title you re not you comes from kate as she asks bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation the secondary characters are also well developed including kate s husband evan bec s roommate jill and to a lesser degree bec s lover liam liam a married faculty member represents another dimension of bec s floundering and her search to in a sense pick a major ultimately the story becomes a vehicle for bec s eventual direction of career choice i recommend as a thought provoking read and for the strong writing and character development additionally if you know \( or have known \) someone with als i believe you ll appreciate the author s knowledge and sensitivity from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group,positive

typical feinstein \( a season on the brink excepted \) quick gossipy superficial fawning etc etc this book is about the 2002 u s open golf championship at the bethpage black golf course a new york state park course on long island the subtitle inside the ropes at bethpage black is used here as a figure of speech meaning behind the scenes \( inside the ropes is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself spectators are separated from the golfers caddies officials and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action \) feinstein s purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion we see u s golf association \( the organization that conducts the tournament \) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament \( e g 4 850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and u s g a can have a huge payday \) about random qualifiers and random competitors and about the resurrection of the black golf course yet the book does not fulfill its promise my guess is that feinstein s indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis i had hoped for,negative
i ll be blunt i didn t care for this book i bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the gnostic sophia instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions her i really think the title was misleading as a sidenote lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of gnosis,negative

in all the talk about education issues these days it s easy to forget that what s really important is the relationship the energy between students and teacher when the teacher closes his door and is face to face with thirty kids that s where it s at it s not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum it s what happens between people in a classroom this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager active kids and a caring active teacher it s not all pleasant and successes are sometimes small but a pervasive caring underlies it all as a teacher this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork go for a walk go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day,positive

heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention unfortunately these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein s final books we are also treated to some of heinlein s stock characters dirty old men horny female computers naked adolescent girls and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed as if this isn t enough heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing in spite of all their cameo appearances this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout heinlein s earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people especially boys this novel as well as most of heinlein s later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption,negative
ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology so she attacks without understanding she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people s work she denigrates maslow s hierarchy of needs is one example i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers and william coulson as instructors any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book her bias is extreme and obvious so consider this when reading the book no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology,negative
i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown s books in the past decade her early books were utterly magnificent now she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite \( and by now utterly boring \) themes southern manners horse bloodlines and foxhunting blessedly whisker of evil was foxhunting free but suffered from a heavy handed overload of the previous two rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia and many of us have grace manners and respect for others and we don t take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things that s just simply not true that said there were some delightful aspects of whisker of evil the mystery itself was great the animal characters were adorable as ever and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick her quitting the post office was a great \( and very unexpected \) twist i liked reading more about her home and her relationships however the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me was this directed at a heretofore unknown segment of rita mae brown s fan base it was so out of context in this book certain details contributed to the horses relationships to one another but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages as well i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners this is a common theme of ms brown s and it is quite frankly offensive there is a big big world outside of virginia rita mae brown should know this she has lived in it but her books and characters have become so parochial insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue in cheek if it wasn t such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade enough already about southern manners \( a biased perception at best \) ancestor worship bloodlines \( human and horse \) and foxhunting whatever happened to characters like celeste chalfonte,negative
\( 3 75 \) the other reviews can reveal what this book is about what i wanted to share is the extreme responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me he alternately found himself loving the narrator yuriko s sister for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of kazue meanwhile i found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of kazue s meritocratic dreams but a moment later i wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator perhaps it reminded me too much of what i had seen growing up to shock me then there was the simultaneous hilarity and pain of kazue s cluelessness was she a tragic figure blind or both i admired kirino for inspiring me to feel so much for her characters even for yuriko who is certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to believe she is \( i also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly as she considered herself in her 30s is it just because women past 25 in japan are regarded as christmas cake as a friend from japan says \) my attention was quite strained by zhang s tale of chinese hardship \( it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader about how difficult it is for immigrants in japan \) but i immediately forgave kirino when yuriko s older sister admitted herself zhang s account was tedious and could be skipped \( i d recommend others to skim it as well \) again my patience was tested by kazue s journal i just kept on thinking aren t you ready to die yet but i see this was intentional on kirino s part to make the reader struggle between our \( or my \) wanting kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our coldness and complicity in her bullying it also made my boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our own lives who were heading towards the same fate as kazue and yuriko not through prostitution but through drugs what did disappoint me in the end was the last chapter which seemed a cop out if only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and encouraged her that an alternative though more shocking would be more in line with the narrator s character but that is wishful thinking on my part when i give this book to others which i will i will make sure to discuss with them when they ve finished what they thought of the ending this book could have been edited down a hundred pages \( back when it was written in japanese \) but for what it did offer i have no regrets for its consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to further translations of kirino s books this book may not be the masterpiece out was but for anyone who has gone to an elite school on scholarship striven to remain a petite zero wanted to excel while recognizing how off the mark our values of judgment are or wondered just how much her body could be worth reading grotesque is just as powerful an experience as reading out was,positive
i have to give philippa gregory a big thank you for approaching this story from a different perspective from the other boleyn girl it delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of english royalty and wealth again i was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events there were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end i was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book so if you are deciding whether or not you d like to read this after having read the other boleyn girl i greatly encourage you to do so you won t regret it,positive

reviewer alianore s opinion rather too indulgent of its subject is a very accurate portrayal of weir s work i will try to add something to that near perfect review \( note i listened to the unabridged audiobook of queen isabella 22 hrs on 18 cds \) the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable loaded with period details the last third is the worst weir s fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation nay elevation of queen isabella to the role of long suffering much wronged highly deserving and late redeemed just queen of england this book is really subjective rhetorical biographal dramatization i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis it is rhetoric because of the endless weasel words \( and expressions \) used copiously throughout some say it has been said many believe therefore we may assume it can be inferred this isn t just an attribute of her style it is her style comprehensively these expressions occur many hundreds of times commonly in conjunction with wier s subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons equally irksome is weir s double standard of historical psychological analysis she is always declaring for us the contents of isabella s thoughts remarkable gift she has for this many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful but then moments later she will portray isabella s actions from a 21st century point of view always telling the reader how isabella must have might have could have would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history this isn t historical writing it is historical op ed with an obvious agenda i don t loathe this work it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography \( other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris rise of theodore roosevelt and theodore rex i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence yuck really \) if prefer more history when reading \( or listening to \) history and much much less editorial subjectivity retroactive psychology biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation the only way i could enjoy isabella by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly taking it with several pounds of salt as the above referenced reviewer advises 2 5 5,negative
the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj s guilt there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge you won t learn anything new from this book it has a long list of books on the subject but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them were they all equal in quality the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news could it have been intended as a distraction from other news in may 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war this was repeated weekly in 1999 i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea \( must have been a success since the propaganda stopped \) could the double murders in brentwood have been well publicized as a distraction isn t two murders a day the usual la statistics how many other waiters \( just from mezzaluna \) were murdered each year are murders by organized crime often solved the book killing time noted that restaurants and health clubs \( in la and elsewhere \) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution if this explains the murders you won t find much in this book my experience is that most white americans made up their minds in june 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment,negative
the author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel her sentences are long and wordy and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context she goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content her descriptions of life in general seem unreal she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance the storyline is decent in some places but it is generally hard for the reader to follow many times i had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going it is true there were many points in which i wanted to stop reading all together which is a rarity i was altogether disappointed in the book i thought it would be decent from all the literary awards it had won but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose,negative

paul johnson has written a 1 000 page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815 1830 years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today johnson s chosen foci are certainly broad he ranges from events in politics and law to music science and even opium use while almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function johnson s roving eye and pen can be disconcerting he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning also while the book claims to be about world society johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about british society but he s found plenty of ways to range geographically from the western united states \( like kentucky \) to china and singapore throughout his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read overall johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading a vast book that one can pick up open nearly at random and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today,positive

i think in retrospect i wasted my time on this one it had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me as i read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery i kept on hoping that there would be something more to it something more enigmatic a brilliant twist but i was left with despair my major problem with this novel was there were not enough in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer and bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities i will never touch this author s book again a mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best dan brown,negative

i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women s movement that as such it fills a long felt want and that it is to be recommended to those new to unfamiliar with or who feel they should be allied with the women s movement it would it will make an excellent text for those doing women s studies as to those doing social movement studies whether globally or more locally summarising antrobus shows the women s movement as political as recognising women s relationship to social conditions as processal as posed against patriarchal privilege as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation marginalisation isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation one complaint but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone this is the avoidance of the word capitalism even by feminists who are or were once socialists capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus capitalists mostly after all male white and patriarchal call it capitalism and are proud of it so why cannot it not be so named by feminists who could and surely should condemn it this cannot be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political economic determinism of patriarchal socialists so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonf hig \( acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking to the funders they are dependent upon \) or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder gentler global capitalism a global neo keynesian order for which no convincing feminist case has been made pity,positive

after reading the trilogy i was left wondering what the hell happened i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story one of the most creative stories i ve come across in 20 years of reading fantasy there isn t even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess if you look up anticlimax in the dictionary you ll see a picture of this book from first page to last time is wasted on boring characters while all the good ones are either killed off or just mia for the entire book spoilers ahead what about lyra and her parents somehow she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops over a cup of tea naturally and that s it for him in addition to all that this book doesn t even seem to be connected to the first two none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 all in the last 30 pages what happened to the story for cripes sake and what happened to the temptation was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it the whole premise is just so lame to start out with as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn t endanger the universe why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another supposedly they had more than gonads going for them they survived death together pullman didn t feel like thinking it through he just wanted a gut wrenching ending in addition to that he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the reality of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning all of will and lyra s efforts are futile kind of like guess what religion for the rest of us morons after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa elephant aliens or whatever ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper iorek byrnison lee scoresby instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter this is not children s literature it s a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess it s totally dishonest to sell this as a children s book or even as a competent work of fiction all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one we never get closure on lyra s parents we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from we never see will reunited with his mother we get a lame battle where god dies and no one even knows why or how lyra and will fall in love but have to sacrifice it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever with only flimsy reasoning behind it the mulefa and mary malone s work together amounts to nothing everyone just goes home presumably will goes home although we never see it all that yearning after his mother and so forth nothing the major enemies are killed off too easily and what about armageddon what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and you get the idea it all just sort of disovles mary forgot to be the serpent or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa another reader pointed out phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series instead the story falls flat under the weight of the author s own agendas and mockeries what a waste of time i can t believe this book actually won awards it stopped being thought provoking and started being inane and silly it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream instead relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime absurd this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life,negative

i am finding this book quite helpful to getting to know myself better and to have greater control over my emotional responses or mood the authors guide you through several approaches of specific steps you should take to get to know some of your core beliefs which they say may be causing depression you are free to choose the approach that works best for you but you do need to try them all to see what works it is quite time consuming one of the approaches requires you to record your activities and asses your mood every hour the instructions are clear and concice and examples provided are helpful however it does take a true commitment i suppose it may be fair to say that true change most often does take real work,positive

the great locomotive chase is the stuff of legend this somewhat obscure event which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days to second manassas to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union but first time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms telling it well and placing it in its proper context the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue espionage and derring do and if mr bonds had only told the tale itself this book would be well worth the read but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr bonds s ability to tell this gripping tale objectively while putting it in its proper context the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas and by doing so and by explaining why the raid coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war mr bonds gives the otherwise reckless lan of the raiders its proper place andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark even though students of the era will have the natural reaction what were they thinking mr bonds answers that question and the answer as incongruous as it may seem reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished this would be a wonderful adventure story in the great tradition of shelby foote s narrative history of the war but this book does so much more it puts the raid in its proper strategic context and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well told,positive

the best book on the history of world war ii that i ve read in a long time the title has three meanings 1 it can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber the brits called these people rear gunners the yanks used the term tail gunner it s the most dangerous position in the plane 2 the last plane in the formation this was more true in the american combat box than in british usage this position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation it is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there aren t so many guns pointing that direction 3 it can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war this splendid book covers all three of these meanings in addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of germany,positive

ok i know i m going to get hammered for this once again there goes my reviewer rating but i just have to be honest this is a terrible story ok being that it s shakespeare it s prettily told but it s still a horrible story and i can t imagine why otherwise sensible people like it perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue in cheek \( it is a comedy after all \) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not that would almost make it tolerable if i could believe it but given that it is a shakespearean comedy we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a happy one and the situation at the end is far from pleasant or perhaps people believe \( i ve heard this claimed in all seriousness \) that kate has actually triumphed at the end having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly even if this were true i d hardly consider it a happy anding and personally i see little evidence of it no what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman \( some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it \) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who tames her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse \( he doesn t beat her simply starves her and sleep deprives her as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives her spirit may or may not be broken depending on how the part is played but the fact remains that she s forced to behave as if it is and that s not a message that should be bruited about in a comedy this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare s plays,negative

as a dad i was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2 year old this book is lousy though why 1 stupid writing i got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy witty remarks dancing the potty mambo give me a break 2 stupid advice this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he she is an adult i m sorry but a 2 year old just cannot comprehend a long drawn out explanation of why you want them or don t want them to do something how about just saying don t do that or hey you want to try this that seems to work just fine for me why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something what s wrong with just telling your kid what to do \( nicely \) and expecting them to be obedient 3 repeating content this book kept repeating itself over and over okay i got it already i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200 page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages \( or less \) 4 too many references this book constantly refers to other chapters i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page i am not kidding huh is potty training really that freakin complicated all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it how to get started and a few good tips i don t need all these detailed references \( nor do i need the phrase potty mambo repeated to me ad infinitum \) here is all i wanted to know how do i get started what do i do how often do i need to try it should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment maybe this book got to all of that but i quit after page 60 i just couldn t take it anymore after hearing the phrases stay positive and potty mambo repeated to me for the umpteenth time i had to quit i returned this book and got my money back if i were to say anything good about this book i would say that it has a few good tips surrounded by about 180 pages of filler potty training still looms ahead will i be successful probably but to this book i say no thanks,negative

casual book browsers who stumble across braden s book the isaiah effect might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title that there exists some mystical unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques research and understanding i as one such browser had briefly read about the so called bible code which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related with my interest piqued at the title and the book description i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah s precise instructions of prayer i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon what i found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new thought concepts the mixing of religions for example a sort of pick and choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades is recycled over and over again drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science his basic premise of the effect is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel and the world of turning away from him to braden s credit his discussions of the effects of prayer in today s society are commemorable albeit somewhat misguided i agree with him that people in today s society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they ve surrounded themselves however i believe braden over emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer he fails to discuss how humans and their emotions are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer not cosmic emotions and human feelings a disappointing read,negative
how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding,negative

the case for faith is the weakest volume in a strong series strobel s format is fun and engaging i find his books as un put downable as any blockbuster page turner strobel holds a degree from yale law school and he was an award winning legal editor at the chicago tribune he begins with a question does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus does current science support the existence of a creator god does it make sense to have faith in god and then travels north america interviewing acknowledged academic experts on the question at hand some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web protest but strobel s books aren t fair because he only presents one side perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books the first three words of each title is the case for no strobel is not presenting the case against his topic he doesn t represent himself as doing so our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly why should strobel waste paper and time doing that when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing strobel s accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader friendly but he never talks down to his reader if you don t want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing but want to get to the nub of the issue strobel is your man these techniques worked excellently in the case for a creator and the case for christ but less well in the case for faith there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks in the introduction strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton templeton presents a righteous enraged case against god and then tearfully admits how much he continues to adore jesus and indeed to miss him this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love hate relationship with their creator in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one which addresses the question of suffering strobel s friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith even in the face of profound suffering in another brief passage strobel tells of his friend ron bronski who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book they were the most rewarding to read the formal interviews with the experts didn t do a lot for me and some were alienating norman geisler s treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns it may be true that in war children are killed with their adults when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey too there is doubt if not complete disbelief among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place \( see israel finkelstein \) the chapter entitled church history is littered with oppression and violence was especially weak compared to other treatments of the same material strobel s treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper s work strobel doesn t handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace weak christian ideas about humanity s unity as god s children and the value of all life this is not made clear enough in strobel s account all in all i have to say i ve encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books and yet strobel is such a good writer and his technique is so engaging that you could do worse than to read this book read the other two books in the series first though,positive
i have no personal experience with 12 step programs nor do i have dominant addictions \( other than book and dvd buying \) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking over eating and love addictions in particular i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients this book takes a rational emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal and often over generalised attacking crusade against 12 step programs some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12 step programs were valid and useful similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12 step programs and in very derogatory judgmental language he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements \( and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered \) i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language he could have suggested modified views and tools and alternatives to consider i can t imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12 step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground,negative

this is an extraordinary biography for while blumenson s admiration for george patton is evident it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of patton s personality both positive and negative the book truly goes beyond the popular perception of the general and far beyond the movie in exploring his character and motivations not an overly long book but thorough detailed and very enjoyable to read,positive
i disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless i think it easily earns 4 5 5 stars it is over a decade old now and i don t think it is intended as a source for scholars of english but for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read i can t compete with some of the above reviewer s scholarly points but i don t think replacing some of bryson s dogma with their own is worthwhile mother tongue is a great starting point and very educational bryson s dictionary of troublesome words is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me,positive
this cookbook has become one of my favorites i grew up in se texas and once i moved away no mexican food could compare now i have the understanding on what differeintiates tex mex and mexican food the recipes are exact and delicious i love the pictures the stories and most of all the inspiration to cook my favorite meals its definately a book for any tex mex lover i highly reccomend it just try and sit and read it and not have your mouth water,positive
the player provided a trip back in time to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century through the times of the first world war to understand what mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control he realized that he was a role model for others not only the young kids that idolized him but the everyday american worker to know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field his charity work volunteering for wwi at the age of 37 gives us a better insight to the individual the book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game before the black sox scandal he knew it was going on tried to warn others but no one would listen a great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time one that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today s game,positive

black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african american studies a classic work of sociology that still resonates today it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology however a school that today stands in some disrepute at least in some circles indirectly it was the target of james baldwin s famous attack on richard wright in his essay everybody s protest novel the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school due to its insistance upon using a scientific approach merely reproduces the very terms under which african americans have been oppressed a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno still black metropolis is a landmark study and unfortunately many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse not better since 1945 the year of black metropolis publication which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society since then as we know we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days so much so in fact that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book embodying american liberalism as it does which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look,positive
so this page turning thriller was on the best selling list for a gazillion months and put catholic and fellow christian faithful in a defensive uproar i m fairly well read and yes i ve earned a few bucks with my prose i m also a sucker for historic tales ancient folklore mythology and old testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits ok i decided now that it s in paperback i ll give it a read what i concluded was this those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown s work is a literary steaming pile i read page after page waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat s ass about the da vinci code s protagonists what a bunch of twits langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology \( i don t know if i spelled that right but i m not about to go back in that book and check it \) apparently there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon s books sell better than brown s entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who s easy on the eyes someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn t a dipwad like landgon she s got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough but she s been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high falluting most french probably couldn t tolerate it and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near \( but of course \) versaille this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro so he s been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything or something like that oh i forgot teabing s crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him anyway this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do make lofty self affirmed pronouncments about how the world s going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag the point is that these characters aren t very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it hell it s been more than 100 years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world but back to how bad this book is trite doesn t begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase i would give you some examples but like i said i m not going back in there one of the more laughable scenes of upper crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor by now sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times been on the run and are exhausted with a straight face brown describes how sophie s delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by crumpets yes crumpets hell teabing shut up about your conspiracy theories roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat offer langdon a stiff drink i sure needed one at this point by now i m pulling for the albino then they escape the jaws of death yet again and naturally high tail it to england on teabing s private jet i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he d left his grey poupon behind i stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the albino wasn t going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists i don t know how it ends i don t care however there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery who knows you might like it this is just my opinion,negative
this book is a place to start at best the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices this book calls for dried spices at times the dishes don t produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family the book is not a total loss however the spinach pies are acceptable there are many other books out there that i would recommend first,negative
i m almost finished reading this book and what a long fun ride it s been wordy and a little confusing this book has to be taken in the right mood or else you ll miss the humor the places that the main character travels to are memorable and exciting and i found myself getting through a hefty portion without thinking that i had ever started some no more like most of the satire is cryptic and hard to find however i read up on the book and it immediately popped out at me and made alot more sense this is an excellent book that i m sure you will enjoy it might even suit as a read aloud story for younger children,positive
it is interesting to see how golems evolve from pratchett s discworld novel feet of clay \( 1996 \) where they are speechless slaves of clay to going postal \( 2004 \) where a well educated but humorless golem serves as body guard and lecturer in morals to the new post master this is where it all begins commander sir samuel vimes of ankh morpork s night watch pays a visit to the dragon king of arms at the urging of his new wife who thinks sam needs his own coat of arms now that he s been knighted unfortunately one of sam s ancestors was a regicide so his descendent is denied an armorial bearing by the college of heralds he does learn that one of his watchmen is actually the earl of ankh the inimitable corporal nobbs who is forced to carry around a piece of paper signed by ankh morpork s patrician certifying that he s really human well this is a bit of a come down for sir sam but he s got more important matters on his mind including the murders of two harmless old men one of them was beaten to death by a loaf of dwarf bread his body was discovered by captain carrot and corporal angua the only werewolf in the night watch when they visited the dwarf bread museum on their day off the only link between the two corpses is a trace of white clay at both murder scenes subplots zigzag every which way through feet of clay corporal earl of ankh nobbs is being courted by a group of well nobs who haven t given up on the notion that ankh morpork should be ruled by a king captain carrot hereditary king of ankh morpork who wisely refused the crown in men at arms is busy tracking murderers and emancipating golems sargeant colon is about to retire if he lives through a trip through the sewers with wee mad arthur corporal angua helps a new dwarf recruit come to terms with her yen to wear lipstick death who has at least a walk on role in all the discworld fantasies is still working on his sense of humor i am death not taxes i turn up only once if this sounds confusing it isn t it s brilliant all of the story lines tie together according to character i don t know how pratchett digs through the sewers and stockyards of ankh morpork and rubs together a monarchist plot with a bit of animated clay to create such a gem i think he must use magic,positive
i purchased this book several months ago during that time i ve tried several of the recipes the french lentil soup is very good the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing the chili was so so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste the recipe for mushroom french lentil and chestnut ragu says to see glossary for the chestnuts but there s nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts it wasn t until i read another recipe \( smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup \) that chestnuts were discussed the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster far too much red onion \( which my guests mostly picked out \) although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare as someone who works full time a 20 ingredient recipe holds very little allure no matter how good it sounds i had trouble finding some of the ingredients for example the author specifies several different types of squash which i haven t been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer s markets the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents if you re looking for a specific recipe you ll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop,negative

more than anything else alan furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of world war ii espionage i a serebin inhabits the urbane world of russian emigres in the europe of 1940 1941 mainly in paris but also in roumania serebin is recruited into what seems to be the british secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of roumanian oil to the nazi war machine the whole operation reeks of amateurism appropriate enough at that stage of the war brainy careful daring but amateur with one exception none of the players know completely what they are part of which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line still furst s prose forms the characters into full dimensional beings from bogart s casablanca or graham greene s human factor highly recommended for readers with an interest in espionage or ww ii,positive

i so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book i read it recently for a book club selection and let me tell you if i didn t have to read it i would have put it down after the first twenty pages and never picked it up again i found it to be dark depraved disgusting and depressing an examination of love in all it forms hardly these characters were just plain goofy i finally figured it out towards the end of the book these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually they were looking to other humans to provide them with true love and that is just barking up the wrong tree i am giving it one star only for the rich use of language,negative
the book is well written most parts of it i can agree with but there is a crucial mistake in parson s message oneness likes to play separation i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation duality ego is simply a mistake illusion caused by mind evolution saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion also his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the mercy of something and this is clearly very dualistic without ego both doing and not doing are actions of oneness to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake there are many illuminating sentenses in this book but be aware of the neo advaitan trap in my life it was understanding especially of the process of ego illusion image helped me to come to oneness the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness there is no duality in doing and not doing at right this moment you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop of courses you make choices in daily life if you really understand what is meant by nond duality you will not make such statements such as there is no choice,negative
alright for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals or lacking in substance i say this who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are who is rand to say what substance is you ve got to look at her bias first realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom as if outside factors never matter and maybe they don t for her maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today but i doubt it though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live outside influences do affect a person but she doesn t thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap all books that are not driven solely by the individual s sense of reason don t read cause it will lessen your iq any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn t find worthwhile or cannot understand she condemns rand at least as portrayed in what i ve read of her work is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality they are either good or worthless the pieces of art she says are empty are empty absolutely they don t fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer nothing to offer her that is how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history s best books telling other people \( with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual \) what they should read truthfully any criticism in this form like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world is elitist crap trying to close people s minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others they have their bias like anyone else i say read in variety observe art outside of rand s choice of art take in all you can with an open mind then start pondering whether you agree or not if you then agree because you agree then i say great its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address she says question society but by my line of inquiry she says be an individual but only i know the basis of who you want to be,negative
this book describes the eleven year psychotherapy process for a woman with sixteen different personalities the analysis process took place from 1954 through 1965 sybil the subject of the book was a child of the 1920 s and 30 s and her multiple personality disease was a result of her family s genetic history and her fundamentalist repressed and abusive upbringing much of sybil s struggles were due to the time period in which she lived her family had mental illness but felt that ignoring it and focusing on other pursuits was the best course of action she was so denied the exploration of her feelings that she choked back all symptoms of mental illness and tried to act normal hindering her recovery for years i am still in shock over the patience and dedication that was required to work with the frustratingly different personalities over a period of eleven years i got frustrated at the slow and relapse prone re integration process at the end of the book and i admire schreiber for painstakingly recounting the process instead of using hollywood style short cuts sybil s recovery and emergence as a complete functional woman in her forties was a very hard won victory during the revealing of sybil s personalities i really liked vicky she was the all seeing personality who know the lineage of all others i liked her better than i liked the backbone less sybil and i wanted her to exist for this lost woman during the personality integration process i learned that all of the personalities were a part of sybil and such exaggerated emotion as vicky s had to be integrated in to part of the whole sybil overall this is an amazing book that well stands the test of time,positive

for years i had heard the akashic records being touted as the unwritten spiritual book of life that included every event every living soul who had ever taken a breath from the beginning of time through eternity the subject was beyond fascinating as my limited mortal mind could not grasp the enormity of such a body of knowledge existing however i took it on absolute faith that this was so and recently endeavored to find the quintessential book on the subject knowing of mr cayce s tremendous psychic following i assumed this book would enlighten me and others i excitedly bought a new copy for myself and sent another to a friend after trudging through the first 68 pages i felt lost and befuddled the writing and text are difficult to follow and not at all in layperson s language perhaps this book is meant for an experienced psychic mind and intellect one who understands the language and is willing to muddle through the long winded case histories to discover meaning and relevance my friend confessed she had read a mere chapter or two then set it aside pie dumas author life coach,negative
i had high hopes for this book there are too many parts that feel self serving and pointless i felt like i was reading the author s autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader i found the preface by one of the author s former professors to be the best part of the book i would not recommend buying this book,negative
i can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training here s the problem the book and cd basically outlines a method of ear training it is not ear training itself for example for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the cd it is just that an example not a training so there is one 14 note lesson on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals i don t think so however if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals you could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that s the core of ear training in fact if you re an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords by the way the cd itself mostly uses really dull organ patches the idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction however since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone this is another example of how this book cd in itself won t be of much use to students,negative

this is the best review of the jfk assassination that i have seen there is still a large assassination industry which can afford to find documents that you haven t read and charge you with ignorance if you haven t read them and find 15 more if you read them this gives a common sense overview that seems quite reasonable i trust it i am always willing to consider other opinions but the balance of evidence has always indicated that oswald acted alone it would be nice to have a new edition of this book,positive

this fantastic re imagining of the avengers is best consumed in this form yes there are too many pop culture references yes the hulk is a little goofy and the ultimate nick fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but i think once your done with this gigantic thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about this story arc takes the alternate universe avengers from their creation to their first major victory ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good the second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well this is the best that the ultimate universe has to offer is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers no inline skates teen angst or first love in this one millar and hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd these thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and i read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand my wife got her msw in the time it took the skrull war to unfold it sucked and the new series isnt much better thankfully it has only one issue to go hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin yes it s just a super hero comic but its one of the best so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a favor and check it out and keep an eye out for the second series hardcover,positive
robert allen s previous book multiple streams of income is excellent and i can t say enough good things about it this one was a major disappointment in comparison he talks about the same rehashed internet marketing strategies that everyone else does creating email lists newsletters blah blah blah the most disappointing thing about robert allen and i lost so much respect for him over this is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast what s stupid about the whole thing and demonstrates that he s a snakeoil salesman scam artist is that what he s selling by email is a course on how to make money on the internet so how do you make money on the internet according to robert allen by selling courses showing people how to make money on the internet is the only way to make money on the internet that s a scam how does he sleep at night don t buy this book it s a waste of money,negative

how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding,negative

the previous review is clear about the value of this translation knowing a bit of german i can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for gestalten the real value of the work beyond the translation however especially for first time readers is found in the notes made by david luke these notes are helpful for the historical context allusions to goethe s personal life and work and allusions to philosophy literature and more all essential to understanding the work,positive

this book really wasn t at all what i was expecting or what the title would lead one to believe the subtitle in search of grace o malley and other legendary women of the sea makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o malley with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers not so the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information i knew almost nothing about grace o malley going into the book and i know little more than that now the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail and most of them aren t even real historical figures but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids she even talks about pippi longstocking not what i was expecting at all the pirate queen is actually devoted far more to sjoholm s travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study she describes the inns she stayed at the weather the tourists she met her own childhood the abundance of personal bath mats in northern european hotels almost everything but grace o malley and her cohorts in fact the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm a story which to be quite honest i really couldn t care less about i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures it turned out to be a travel memoir and a comparatively uninteresting one at that this is a shame really sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions grace o malley herself bessie millie janet forsyth christian robertson eliza fraser isobel gunn betty mouat freydis eiriksdottir skipper thuridur trouser beret alfhild the herring lassies and numerous mythological characters to whet my appetite but then fails to deliver a full satisfying portrait of any of them she raises more questions than she answers and i d need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information you may also notice given the names that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who though from europe sailed the caribbean as for sjoholm s writing style the book is an easy read but not a very enjoyable one sjoholm s writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors for example the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates walnuts and chocolate chips in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola \( pg 222 \) flowery gratuitous and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin you might say it s not the worst book i ve ever read but i do wish i d spent my money on something else it doesn t deliver what it promises and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead,negative
i started reading this book hoping for the best in turn i found that my hopes weren t fulfilled the beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more after the tone changed the book became bitter and boring the characters lost their flare and the whole book lost personality the book became dull and lost appeal to me the book s writing style in the beginning was original and fun following the death of little red the book slowly fell apart leaving me tempted to stop reading the book if someone asked me to recommend a good book this would not be the one,negative

when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop i decided at once that i needed to own it it s large it s bulky but it s beautiful it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom s works as an artist myself who learnt a lot from tom s unique techniques i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art both colour and black and white has been compiled into this collection but it s not just pictures there s an insight into the man himself a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists like myself waiting for recognition,positive
this is one of the worst written programming books i have seen yet i m sorry i bought it it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance and dangerously little about c programming duffy s review correctly describes the main flaws i would add that \( 1 \) the book is not structured to build upon oo gof patterns or stl design principles \( 2 \) the code does not follow even basic c coding conventions \( 3 \) the images \( screenshots \) are agonizingly unreadable \( 4 \) the code listings are in italics using a variable pitch font is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a 100 book \( 5 \) no over arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers for example pg 19 data types section int holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million for example int i 2000000 long same as int wrong professor this is not only a syntactically incorrect example but a just plain wrong assertion if the reader does not know how to determine the \( platform specific \) size of an int or long then the author has only served to confuse the matter further furthermore i consider it a cheapskate tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form \( particularly when the book s code listings are so sloppy \) that said i would not use the code even if it had been supplied for free but it might have been interesting to have something to play around with have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate advanced fin techs who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations \( futures forwards etc \) but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code,negative
this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries in between the entertainment biz cliches the author can only think to put various assination hits some of the characters are interesting but not believable and they certainly can t make up for the braindead plot read some of his other novels and skip this one,negative

if you like math i guarantee you ll like this book the author starts out with some very nice infinite sums from 17th and 18th century mathematics \( newton leibniz the bernoullis and euler s gamma function \) he continues into the 19th century with riemann and lebesque integrals weierstrass pathological functions cantor s set theory and winds up with baire s category theorem reading this book is like taking a guided tour through real analysis \( calculus of one real variable \) with the math prof you always wished you had its only prerequisite is a working knowledge of calculus the main points are explained very clearly so the reader can skip through the book or fill in the details and will learn a lot either way the book is very well written and a great pleasure to read i highly recommend it for students fans and teachers,positive
i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one sided book i ve ever read it wasn t about the crimes it was about this author s personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos he has a real problem with women lesbians in particular he made ms wuornos out to be someone she wasn t she had a hard life yes and chose to committ crimes but that wasn t what this book was about again it wasn t worth the i actually threw my copy of this away,negative

i give this book a 4 star rating not because i believe in the necronomicon but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome \( though i doubt it s authenticity per se \) it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other and more valid than some dead names has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique wandering bishop phenomena and the so called slavonic orthodox church overall both an informative and entertaining volume whether you believe or not,positive

as i began to read this book i was reminded of jack dempsey s observation that champions get up when they can t all of us have encountered professional setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially difficult to overcome most of the examples which jeffrey sonnenfeld and andrew ward cite in this book involve ceos who either fired back and eventually prevailed after a career setback \( e g donald trump martha stewart bernie marcus jimmy carter and george foreman \) or never fully recovered from them \( e g jill barad john scully leona helmsley jacques nasser and linda warnaco \) the former demonstrate the importance of seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph which sonnenfeld and ward recommend the latter demonstrate the probable consequences of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a five step strategy for rescuing and restoring a career and reputation after a devastating professional setback is based it would be a disservice to sonnenfeld and ward as well as to those who read this brief commentary if i were to list the lessons and steps which are best revealed within the narrative of this remarkably thoughtful eloquent and practical book each is anchored in a real world context each is relevant to anyone now embarked upon or preparing for a professional career i mention this last point because some who consider purchasing this book may incorrectly assume that its material will be of greatest value only to senior level executives on the contrary all of sonnenfeld and ward s observations and recommendations can be of substantial benefit to anyone who wishes to \( a \) avoid a devastating professional setback or \( b \) recover from one in essence this book provides sonnenfeld and ward s response to this question how can i overcome a professional setback to their credit at no time do they minimize or trivialize the impact of a professional setback \( presumably each has experienced a few of his own \) they fully appreciate the difficulty of overcoming the debilitating psychological stress of failure the challenges of failure to one s reputation \( both personal and professional \) social biases about failure and other challenges which may be unique to one s company its culture and its industry if not tragic or devastating a setback almost always lowers one s self esteem is embarrassing and has adverse financial consequences more often than not there is collateral damage to one s family members and or to one s close colleagues at work so guilt also comes into play recall the dempsey quotation provided earlier presumably sonnenfeld and ward agree with dempsey on the importance of courage and also with me that it is much easier to summon the courage to get up when you are convinced that the situation is not hopeless and that you can indeed recover if you understand what has happened why it has happened and how you can and should respond to it of course it is preferable to avoid a setback in the first place \( if ifs and buts were fruits and nuts \) most of us are not so fortunate and i for one have learned the most important lessons from failures \( mine and others \) rather than from successes whether or not a given failure is our fault it is certainly our responsibility to take full advantage of the learning opportunity it offers and then to make positive and productive use of whatever truth has been revealed it is interesting to examine the lives of great leaders who rebound after career disasters but in my opinion it is imperative to examine with rigor and candor one s own values attitudes and behavior especially when struggling to understand and then recover from a professional setback which is invariably a personal setback also as sonnenfeld and ward make crystal clear this journey of personal discovery is by no means easy nonetheless it is one which must be initiated with commitment and then sustained by persistence throughout one s life if and when setbacks occur and they always do the practical advice which sonnenfeld and ward offer in this book will enable those who absorb and digest it to understand and \( yes \) accept what has happened understand why it has happened and then leverage that wisdom effectively and productively not only in their careers but in their personal lives,positive

this is the worst novel that i have ever read by a major author i have read a couple other alex cross novels and i did not find them to be awful at all they weren t very good but they kept me turning the page while i was reading this dreck i began to get a sense of patterson s work ethic he sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it one maybe two chapters per day i suppose and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result not a snowball s chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren t written by patterson i m done don t waste your time really,negative

filled with bizarre generalizations and the most pretentious phraseology i ve seen in years this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20 years jodi dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings of culture history politics or even writing style it seems she should have spent more time with turabian s manual for writers than surfing the web or watching sienfeld,negative
i can t give this book more than two stars and that s being generous mr hall does present some interesting ideas but unfortunately his editors have done him a huge disservice here are the first three sentences of stage i on page 23 essentially what we have now nanoscale science and technology including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes and a very limited ability to manipulate that is by pushing things around with the same scanning probes a scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick because you have a computer behind it you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture i made it through the first fifty pages and it didn t get any better i don t know if mr hall had a final read before publication or not but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited,negative
i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations in chapter 5 he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly he says the value of c \( t \) must be infinite or nonzero but doesnt bother to show why this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions its not all bad but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it i have read good textbooks this isnt one of them,negative
this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett s five novels which he wrote between 1929 and 1934 a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks low lives and the seedier side of life into hard boiled hard hitting detective stories this was a time when urban corruption was the rule and private detectives journalists and police officers shared information two of these novels the maltese falcon and the glass key are american classics another the thin man inspired one of hollywood s best loved movie franchises hammett s novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place laying bare violence corruption and pervasive cynicism but they re not dreary the sharp prose crackles and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it steadfast in their own codes of conduct their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels the thin man appeared first in redbook the others in black mask the maltese falcon \( 1930 \) and the glass key \( 1931 \) are flawless the maltese falcon features private detective sam spade a irresistible femme fatale and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette the last pages of the book are some of the most hard hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction and they re brilliant the glass key explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city oddly the detective is the right hand man of a crime boss red harvest \( 1929 \) features the adventures of hammett s most popular detective the continental op in a town called personville or poisonville to those who know it better the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare the novel s opening paragraph deserves to be read several times the thin man \( 1934 \) is an attempt at humor among new york s blue blooded cold blooded upper crust hard boiled humor is interesting in concept but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny and hammett s style was in decline at this point at least his characteristic cynicism wasn t the dain curse \( 1929 \) is another continental op novel this one is melodramatic absurd and not up to hammett s usual standards hammett fans shouldn t miss it but others may find it pointless i described the novels in order of descending quality complete novels organizes them chronologically five novels is a lot to pack into one book but complete novels doesn t resemble a door stop it s a handy size actually the print is not too small but the pages are quite thin editor stanley marcus a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett s work has included a chronology of hammett s life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett s life the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels which are useful the notes also contain an introduction to the maltese falcon written by hammett in 1934 in which he explains the origins of that novel s characters it s quite interesting for those who prefer to own these novels separately vintage crime black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions but if you want hardback and don t mind all five novels in one volume this is quite a nice book,positive

first published in 1936 this is the 12th poirot book the 3rd superintendent battle book and the 2nd colonel race book and has no narrator it s the first case in which superintendent battle mrs oliver or col race appear together with poirot or each other and the only case in which all do so at once the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes where poirot encounters mr shaitana a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case but it becomes clear that he s a victim waiting to happen for shaitana like a few other collectors in christie s universe has succumbed to a foolish temptation and begun collecting people and not just people of talent or genius but murderers and being a connoisseur he collects only the best those who have gotten away with it he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby without naming names and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of tigers \( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger but would do so from outside the tiger s cage having respect for the danger \) poirot accepts the supper invitation however to find that there are seven other guests including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers explorer major despard a strong silent type mrs lorrimer a middle aged widow who is very serious about bridge timid young anne meredith and dr roberts a loud and jovial general practitioner shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder but otherwise the subject does not come up and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper arising from the final game to find their host dead stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players this is of course poirot s fantasy case as he once remarked in the abc murders because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another there are only the people themselves and their memories of the evening and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they d committed and gotten away with rather than following poirot s viewpoint in third person throughout some chapters follow battle race or mrs oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case each represents a different style battle is a professional police officer race an empire builder type secret agent and mrs oliver a writer of detective stories battle of course has a duty to investigate shaitana s murder and does so in an orthodox style cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him race deals with checking out major despard the explorer who s most clearly his kind of person mrs oliver for her part works on worming information out of not only anne meredith but her roommate rhonda \( whose attitude is that anne could ve lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she d been paying attention \) and of course there s poirot he s really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn pursuing two major lines of questioning \( 1 \) describe how the bridge games played out and \( 2 \) describe the scene of the murder \( the elaborate collector s room in shaitana s house where the bridge games were played \) see if you can figure out where poirot s questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues and what he learned from the responses he received,positive
i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i d admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals,negative

although i m not new to wwii histories the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne s the price of glory since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi s most epic battles i did not hesitate to read stalingrad the fateful siege by antony beevor in both works comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander s control and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down from the well documented cold lice and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov s trap it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor s work makes the reader sympathize for russians germans romanians and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers he also examines the more famous players in the battle including a paranoid stalin a dreaming hitler a finger pointing von manstein and a indecisive paulus indeed the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad overall stalingrad the fateful siege is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard hitting military history,positive

this book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a christian which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace so much of the christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite we see more often the christian faith portrayed as a religious form political arm and unloving attitude this book is a real insight into the christian faith of how to be a true follower of christ who cared so much about individuals especially those who were not self righteous but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives,positive
david fromkin s peace to end all peace is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east \( extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia \) was created during and after the first world war obviously in order to do this the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered this is where fromkin s unusual methodology comes into play focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the eastern question in their favour the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process admittedly it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire \( and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter \) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations the problem that fromkin has however is that he does not make these very well at all the story is told in a roughly chronological manner which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters ultimately the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is additionally fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well shown on the maps provided indeed one map \( showing enver pasha s advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia \) is laughable in the extreme the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows and not equilateral triagles where fromkin does well however is in his use of purely european sources it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question in terms of europe however his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did ultimately a peace to end all peace is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been \( the chapters in margaret attwood s the peacemakers or william cleveland s modern middle east both easily outshine this \),negative
the author makes a couple of valuable points first any long term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent secular \( i e indefinitely long \) bear markets most leading investment advisors recommend a buy and hold strategy but this only works during predominately bull market periods most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982 1999 bull market which is anomalous in historical terms the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that buy and hold doesn t always provide the best returns obviously then it s better to pull out during the bear markets but that s easier said than done the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets including p e ratio interest and inflation rates and gdp the problem is that those characteristics don t always correlate with market performance for example this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market well if you heeded his advice you would have missed the bull market of 2004 2005 and early 2006 especially in small mid caps and foreign stocks even with high p e ratios a bull market can continue for several years witness the late 90s it s virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis there is so much volatility on a daily weekly monthly and yearly basis that s it s impossible to know when the market has switched directions by the time that it is apparent it s too late to profit even in the midst of great bull markets there might be week month or even year long downturns the author says nothing about individual stock picking beyond a general value approach the book is all about big picture long term trends another problem is that the author s predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900 but the market \( and economy \) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s as they say past performance does not predict future returns the investment advice provided here is not useful he suggests a portfolio of hedge funds ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k he also recommends a bond ladder an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations i don t need to spend 25 and five hours reading to learn that one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for most studies just average the returns across years but that doesn t reflect real returns let s say you invest 100k into a stock that returns 35 the first year and 15 the second your average return should be 10 a year right wrong at the end of the first year you have 135k minus 15 the second year leaves you with 115k total equal to 7 a year compounded if you had received 10 a year compounded your final total would be over 121k that s 6k difference in just 2 years and the volatility costs add up the book is very poorly written plodding sooooo boring with tons of repetition just as an example the graph showing the y curve relationship between p e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times,negative

i love judith mcnaught s work her historicals are stellar one of kind novels that pull at your heart strings in my opinion all of her historicals are winners some of her contemporary works are fabulous as well perfect and paradise to name a few there are other contemporary flops though \( remember when triumphant heart etc \) every breath you take was such a disappointment the plot character development and writing was not up to par i found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again it was really forced someone mentioned it was amatuerish and i have to agree i think anyone could have written this novel i understand that the book was rushed and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash i love judith but this book was just terrible,negative
i generally like elmore leonard this is the twelfth book of his i ve read ranging from his detroit crime capers to his l a set chili palmer stuff to some of his westerns other than the terrible be cool this is probably my least favorite of his books so far set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 the story follows carlos carl webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u s marshall the story takes place in the dusty midwest mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city as carl faces off with various wanna be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves carl is a somewhat vain cocky lawman with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man a no account young man who has everything he needs but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl s path mixed into this are kinds of period details from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to true detective writers to striking miners to mentions of various real life bank robbers pretty boy floyd john dillinger and bonnie and clyde barrow despite all this background detail the story itself failed to engage me there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard s best work there s a good guy a bad guy and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic in fact about halfway through the book i realized that the real story wasn t going to kick in i was in it and unlike many leonard books the supporting cast of characters isn t particularly memorable even leonard s trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech ultimately one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period and perhaps didn t spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story that said the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story given the time and place all in all unless you re really really into the whole 30s gangster thing not worth the time,negative
as other reviewers have stated ludlum passed away at the time of the publication of this novel unfortunately we may never know what other voice has been mingled with ludlum s to complete this tale honestly speaking i believe this to be the case because the story is actually better than i have come to expect from ludlum no disrespect intended but i feel this work is actually above his standard there is certainly a few moments of unbelievable plotting and characterization but who cares when the ride is such a rip at first you think you re reading a typical espionage thriller and eventually come to realize it s more than that much more for new world order conspiracy fans you re in for a treat ludlum et al s take on an old plot is so fresh and intrigueing you are left speechless i ll just say this if you have ever wondered if the nazi s survived wwii you will really wonder after reading the sigma protocol god help us if there s any truth to this plot,positive

after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory this sequel was an absolute let down the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie s \( formerly wonka s \) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth while beyond the reaches of earth s atmosphere our heroes charlie grandpa joe and mr wonka must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids \( pronounced k nids \) aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes far worse than these beasties though are the insufferable old folks whose twenty year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless charlie joe and wonka with no help from charlie s folks or other grandparents save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills returning them to infancy or beyond charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters at the end of the novel the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president in short these three are the most tedious spiteful unredeemable characters i ve come across in children s literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa loompas as i read this book as it is they \( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory \) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore rather than a joy to read,negative
the four tales in this collection are beautifully composed they are art not just stories each story is deep in its unique complexities each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader s mind and when i look back upon the book as a whole upon the adventurous stories the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely i can t help but be extremely impressed,positive
it seems as if it is impossible for a s byatt to write a bad or even a mediocre story after this novel she is one of my new absolute favorites and i have vowed to read everything this amazing author has written i began to read the virgin in the garden and could not put it down i was enraptured by the beautiful descriptions of the two contrasting elizabethian ages and the characters frederica has to be one of the most despicable and yet intriguing literary characters in years my breath was also taken away by the story of marcus potter a haunting amazing character that will stay with you for days the way byatt writes she transports you to 1950s england and the lives of the potters i felt as if i knew these characters like family and could almost sit down to lunch with them by the end of the book her style timing and subtle metaphors of passion and life are irresistible and amazing this is truly a writer who will stand the test of time to become an icon in the likes of the brontes jane austen and kate chopin i cannot wait to share this book with everyone i know highly highly reccomended go to the bookstore or your local library ignore the new glossy bestsellers that try and cheat you out of your money and instead pick up this gorgeous powerful read that new authors cannot hold a candle to,positive
this book is more of an advertisement for scoblete s other books his writing buddies other books and his golden touch craps siminar this book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control which is the reason i bought this book the book is rather a collection of stories scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps it would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up especially the captain the authors ultimate craps hero i couldn t even finish this book it was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through and left the reader with no knowledge gained if you are interested in a good casino book i recomend something by avery cardoza or a book published by his company,negative
here s a good litmus test to show how good a book like breathing lessons is nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret there are no car chases explosions sex scenes \( barely even any kissing \) or exotic locations no one changes or has an epiphany almost nothing happens maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter in law but nothing changes at all to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull heck if someone told me the plot of this book i d think it was really dull too but i didn t want to put it down the reason is that maggie and ira are so well drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira that s how real they seemed to me i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they don t seem like characters acting their parts they seem like real people because of this even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days in all honesty what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i ve ever read about how to write a book this is purely a character driven novel with very little plot except for the death of maggie s friend s husband that gets the ball rolling everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie s personality more than any artificially generated plot twists it s hard for me to find any real faults with this book except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long some people may call this boring or dull but i would call it purely exceptional i loved this book and highly recommend it,positive

shakespeare s life is frustratingly beyond our sight aside from the plays \( which in many cases come down to us in different versions \) we have a slim scattering of legal documents marriage and birth records and vague secondary accounts as the world s preeminent shakespeare scholar greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and with a healthy dose of conjecture arrive at something resembling a biography of the world s greatest dramatist more than that though this work is a biography of the age in which shakespeare lived and wrote elizabethan and jacobian london and how the major events of this time affected shakespeare s plays for example the writing of king lear may have been encouraged by a trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and estate while the youngest daughter \( named cordell \) tried to stop them a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the bard s greatest tragedy what impressed me the most about this biography is how ordinary shakespeare seemingly was he didn t seem pretentious or snobbish as some people envision him he was born to a humble family and lived frugally despite dying a rather wealthy man although greenblatt s writing is clear and accessible he makes the assumption that you have already read shakespeare s plays or at least are very familiar with them i have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when he discussed plays i hadn t read so if you haven t read more than say ten of his plays the major ones you need to crack open the norton shakespeare \( of which greenblatt is the editor in chief \) before you approach will in the world,positive

i read this book several months ago and i still can t shake the feeling of having read a very very good book the effect of yourcenar s words still lingers the text is an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor hadrian to his successor the emperor himself is dying and faces a world that he is about to leave behind he recalls his life from being a young boy in his native spain to his ascension to the highest public post imaginable that of emperor of rome just as his professional career was incredible so is the generosity and candidness of his confession there is seemingly no secret nook left untouched from his personal life in the end having cast that final weight his conscience from off his shoulders the emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face another that of the gods,positive

the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult by definition a cult is a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian charismatic leader in christ s day many would have considered his movement \( christianity \) a cult by definition and now it s the largest religious form of worship in the world so let mormons do their thing there s upwards of 12 000 000 of them now so i guess they re not a cult anymore,negative

updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development as other have stated you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab a truck and a bomb the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else perhaps excellent writing interesting character development or original insights updike fails to deliver on all three counts one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad when ahmad speaks it is in the voice of an intelligent thoughtful foreigner his phrasing captures very well the cadence vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non native speaker of english curiously ahmad is an american raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother so what influences created this stilted phrasing updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character s life is grating updike also relies heavily on ethnic religious stereotypes sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature however in updike s case the stereotypes make little sense at all for instance a high school counselor s entire personality is attributed to his jewishness both by himself and by others who opine on his personality this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and in fact his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier so where does all the jewsih influence come from likewise ahmad s mother s personality is often linked to her irish heritage yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background \( which could have been many generations ago \) has influenced her one bit the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype other than simply poor writing and careless character development another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic obviously few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script after all the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind ultimately the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author,negative

i grew up reading harold evan s sunday times in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome \( i m irish \) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland however from today s perspective the paper s foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as what would the world do without henry kissinger indeed this has always seemed to be mr kissinger s view also and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles \( ss 20s \) being deployed in russian forests i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions supported by diagrams of saddam s mobile chemical biological weapons labs which turned out not to exist in saying all the above i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch the book has three sections the first describes some of the episodes which made evan s sunday times great the investigative reports from the insight team and others of malicious cover ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry \( thalidomide \) and the aircraft industry \( mcdonnell douglas \) the publication of the crossman diaries laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet having established his credentials as a vertical journalist evan s term which he describes as seeking to get to the bottom of things and lauding his proprietors the thomson s for allowing him to do so the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr murdoch as owner the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating the thomson s were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of national directors guarantees which if breached were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times one of the free worlds most revered titles in his description of the paper evans reveals an almost po faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment he sees it as the paper of record upholding fair non partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people s educational background almost every colleague is named and then his her school and university are listed for example joe smith winchester oxford to establish both social class and academic \( perhaps intellectual \) credentials he documents the four pillars of the times as its reporting of parliament its legal coverage its obituaries and its leader columns oh dear stolid stuff from the fearless vertical investigative editor nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan s new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which by implication criticise his predecessor as editor \( william rees mogg \) and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution looming behind this story is murdoch s general management style haphazard interventions secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors the text here is well paced and descriptive the tension plays havoc with everyone save perhaps murdoch evan s second in command betrays him various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys the national directors turn out to be paper tigers \( this is too good a pun to delete \) the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken piecemeal the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious double dealing murdoch whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval however by the time i got to this section i had sadly lost a lot of respect for evan s impartiality his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities this was reaffirmed in my mind when on the day that evan s agreed to reign who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor initially at least popular evans though personally engaging and i m sure mercurial and demanding came to represent a set of fading political beliefs the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union the fading indeed failing social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change the rest of the story evans attractive forthrightness murdoch s furtive acquisitiveness while the human interest focus of the story are ultimately a side show this book is well told highly dramatic and engaging however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done,negative

according to charles kimball religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth religion inspires humans to transcend their self interests while at the same time more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution using a comparative religious approach kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil kimball argues the word religion is amorphous and difficult to define as a result the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions kimball next asks if religion is the cause of evil and he answers both yes and no a religion that is arrogant condescending and requires adherents to disconnect their brain is problematic on the other hand religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine the propensity towards evil increases dramatically sacred texts sources of wisdom and guidance become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims christianity and islam have missionary mandates but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims kimball argues for a human view of truth one that is dynamic and relational allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities when a charismatic leader demands total obedience has unrestricted power and has total control religion is unhealthy uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection strict segregation from the larger society combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time the likelihood for disaster increases many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god s agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means when one theological component gets elevated thus becoming an end and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end all religions have notions of sacred space but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space reinforcing or protecting group identity against an other or protecting group identity from within the group are also potentially dangerous signs institutional structures develop in all religious traditions but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a holy war kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990 91 islam is a peaceful religion which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order the word jihad means struggling in the way of god but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense with rules similar to the christian just war theory because of socio economic disparities some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis faith hope and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted against secularism kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time tested wisdom and ethical standards and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity with religious diversity christians have three options exclusivism inclusivism and pluralism but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity finally the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab israeli palestinian conflict then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak,positive

sacred pathways is easy to read plain balanced and straightforward the book surveys 9 different spirituality types for each type it identifies scripture historical characters styles of worship and dangers the book contains an evaluation tool to help the reader identify his or her personal spiritual personality as with any survey tool this book does not go deeply enough into any particular spiritual practice it doesn t need to what it offers is an excellent service to the christian community for those who are trapped in a church that worships in a style predominately different from the their own this book offers the knowledge that the reader is not alone there are others out there that worship in the same way for those who believe that all true worship looks like their style of worship this book offers a broader view of the christian landscape i gave this book 5 stars because it could have a potentially life changing impact on those who have lived in a closed environment,positive

though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs at one point the author actually defends episiotomies she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth it was both infuriating and saddening if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little this is cute if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth this is not for you,negative

i have written software for development projects for 30 years and i have managed several projects martin fowler has extraordinary insight and i enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought i find the main lesson i pick up from this book is break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon refactoring for each of the small projects refactoring works well in some cases i suppose refactoring works well for some people i suppose i m skeptical though fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of refactoring he assures us that refactoring may overload small projects with methodology making it unsuitable for them and it works really well for larger projects i suspect however that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise if i m to risk this methodology on a large project i want to see it perform well on a smaller project first fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples in the case of refactoring the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility,negative
i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women men are to rule and women are to submit to that rule the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read discovering biblical equality it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women,negative

hugh farnham is a blue collar survivalist who likes to play bridge his college age daughter karen her friend barbara his lawyer son duke his alcoholic wife grace and house servant joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit everyone scrambles to safety inside hugh s modern bomb shelter as the bombs fall and his wife is passed out hugh starts up an affair with his daughter s friend barbara right in the shelter as if hugh s shallowness and arrogance wasn t enough to turn you against the protagonist this nauseating little scene will when the shakes and quakes finally end the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible pristine clean world at first glance it looks like utopia but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race imprisoned and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves somehow hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in so that he can be free with barbara of all the apocalypse fiction this book is the worst the protagonist is so lowbrow so arrogant so unlikable so self centered so shallow so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest he s not even a love to hate person the dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant and barbara and hugh s constant prattlings of darling dear and beloved do not fit the characters neither does hugh s occasional spouting of words like shall and shan t along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the n word there is little emotion from these one dimensional characters even though they face the death of hugh s daughter and barbara s friend karen cannibalism castration \( hugh cared more about his boys than he did his real children \) pedophilia racism and exual slavery they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut the entire plot over plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it as if the author himself didn t quite believe his story and if he doesn t believe how can he expect the reader to overall there is no depth or flavor in this story at all other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door i recommend avoiding this book,negative
when john grisham introduced us to bendini lambert locke a memphis tax boutique controlled by the mafia the idea of an in house firm for the mob was hilarious these days no one least of all our hero scott finn is particularly sure that organized crime doesn t just control the firm but also the governor s office the us attorneys office and the boston pd finn who worked and fought his way out of the streets of southie to the thick pile carpets of boston s brahmin legal establishment finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind when a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate little jack who was terrorizing the city finn is drawn into the fray where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying though not very hard to put him away and a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process if it seems over the top it is but it is good fun too,positive
i really didn t enjoy this book i am half italian american and i ve read a few books about growing up in an italian american family in an effort to learn about my roots i have also read several books about 2nd generation americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is normal and their immigrant parents i normally enjoy such books but not this one i know that life wasn t always a bowl of cherries for these familes but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible yet i couldn t find anything about the daughters lives that are really that bad or even different from many people s lives in this country where is all the anger coming from i really don t know this book is dark and depressing some say it is funny at times but i didn t think so i couldn t even bring myself to finish it,negative
when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept i resolved that i would alert other readers generally i enjoy this author s works and anticipated this latest tome i was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it s clues or probable developments everything was telegraphed and nothing was original the conclusion was so lame that i was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue my advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next,negative
i enjoyed this book for the most part i feel the trip throught the stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the mountain the main characters were all there participating in the problem solving there was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode and some food for thought added in as well is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there i don t know but this book presents some interesting questions i await the next book in the series,positive

this is by far my favorite novel by forster and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels period in his first book forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i at least feel that he lost as he got more self consciously philosophical in later books like howard s end and a passage to india he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art bringing them to vivid life undermining tourist cliches and weaving them gracefully into his main themes no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly,positive
i have a hard time understanding what it is that i dislike about the novel i dislike it almost as much as the movie i have been a loyal follower of smiley and some more after that once the cold war was over jlc had to look for a new realm i tried to follow him but gave up with the kaukasian troubles forgot the name of the book maybe it is this jlc s trade mark his usp is the evilness of the other side with the kgb co that worked perfectly his readers were willing to stay with him and believe him now he is transferring the kgb style to all sorts of other badies i think it does not work any more it is not that i trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated i do not what i do not like i guess is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies tess in this story seems to be the normal do gooder who falls foul with the baddies that is more ok in the book than in the movie \( there for my eyes rachel weisz does herself discredit \) what is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way jlc gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations,negative
zadie smith is one of the most powerful authors i have read in recent times she is so subtle about the race factor that we don t get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so she has also captured the emotions of kiki and zora perfectly \( why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments \) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down if you enjoyed the movie crash you will love this one,positive
the author of this book warren wagar is apparently a professor of future studies i certainly hope he has long been fired from that post a short history of the future was written in 1989 but the writer is so ignorant of politics and so wrong to be blunt it reads as if it was written in the 1940 s orwell s 1984 is more on the mark than this he shows barely any creativity in his predictions and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time the fact that he assumes the soviet union will continue plodding along well into the 21st century is incredibly naive the fact that he assumes the nation s socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre did he read the newspapers did he pay any attention to that gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing russia down and honestly did anyone really expect that germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal or that latin america and africa would remain dictatorships forever or that black rule in south africa would not occur until 2014 if this book had been written 30 or 40 ago it would be excusable this book is just sloppy he doesn t even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations like and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose that sort of thing the author is clearly an ivory tower academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague trends the fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future,negative

i ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who s who of public school using this format nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a christian book espousing christian dogma and assumptions i m surprised this is acceptable for use by government funded public schools furthermore there is a lot of non scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition i m very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising some of the parenting tips are common sense that i didn t think needed to be reiterated a person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down i was looking for more than that the advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process there is false logic in some of the parental mistakes an example is always attributing hovering parents to ego issues that a parent needs to be needed some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can t see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger false assumptions leads to false conclusions i gave this 2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book at least could adopt some common sense but it isn t helping my family,negative
malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books he almost makes the process seem easy and maybe it is if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant however much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a plateau ed or downward spiraling church that has been around for 100 years the principles are easy and make sense if you have 100 support of the congregation that s pretty hard to do in most of the churches i ve been in that need strategic planning the most that s no fault of malphurs the book itself is a great book,positive
college stoner cult following aside hunter s thompson s journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say the average wwe heavyweight title match for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide eyed optimism of the 60s but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor s press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting four more years was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while how does the cliche go the more things change the more they stay the same after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern s presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice presidential nominee thomas eagleton just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern s running mate two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press mcgovern s presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover since then we ve seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic mascot will be for the 2008 race perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap but i digress i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book like presidential campaigns themselves can at times seem uneventful thompson addresses this from time to time wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long needed fix other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics for instance hst s extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates reads like hieroglyphics to me,positive
i was quite disappointed by this book i was expecting something with more professional level content it s all very amateur however the artwork used in the examples is sub professional at best i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre press issues relating to comics artwork but the chapter there was frustratingly slight you would be much better to buy a a more general pre press book the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much,negative

spend big bucks and hire the boston consulting group to help you with your strategy and what do you get hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by bcg clients as a result i think this book will be most appealing to mbas thinking about working for bcg and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like for those who are well read in business strategy this book will be a disappointment it focuses on very little you haven t read or thought about many times before skip this book if you are in this category the strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources \( frito lay versus eagle snacks \) adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of \( more variety and better delivery from wausau papers \) threatening competitors sources of profits \( japanese auto makers go after the big 3 s positions in minivans and suvs in north america \) copy and improve on better business models \( batesville casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques \) encourage your competitor to retreat \( attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up \) refocus your business model on one set of advantages \( carmax \) acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable \( masonite international \) and change the nature of competition \( get to low cost sourcing earlier than competitors secure low cost assets sooner and play the wal mart card carefully \) the overall metaphor for the book has its problems if you play to win you are playing hardball al dunlap \( author of mean business \) was a hardball guy but it didn t pay off at sunbeam if i read past the words in the book the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever decreasing resources and advantages keep em down would have been a more accurate title for the book you will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies new forms of technology and new business paradigms this book is about rock em sock em competition among the industrial giants of the world i worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at bcg in the early 1970s and i was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then i do think hardball better captures the classic bcg approach used in the early 1970s than any other book i have read published by the firm or its professional staff bruce henderson would be proud of you from my perspective i graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies \( the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with signaling is pretty risk free \) misstating some of the cases \( did gm really crush ford s ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing it looks more like mutual suicide to me \) and praising more than was due in some cases \( the japanese car companies were very late to come into north america with minivans and suvs \) i also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message rather than enhancing it,positive
i ve been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting well he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting if not spectacular non fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row i won t go into the details of williamson s ordeal but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut and dried book that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers but is still interesting nonetheless he does a good job giving the details of ron s case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues grisham didn t even think about writing ron s story until after ron passed away so there are no interviews to draw upon but he does a decent job of tying it all together i will also say that although he is anti death penalty he doesn t hammer that opinion at you he lets the story itself do the talking i m actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham s next novel as he ll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like the firm or a time to kill not dreck like the king of torts,positive
this book is a standard one for graduate level algebra courses i practically wore mine out over a year long course and came to know it intimately dummit and foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples of course examples are very important however the explanations are often muddled and not clear \( e g see tensor products \) they frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises and the organization is poor consequently it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them also the bindings on this book frequently fail my book fell apart very quickly and i know other students who had the same problem i recommend rotman s advanced modern algebra instead of dummit and foote,negative

when i discovered the existence of this novel i was enthusiastic and intrigued unfortunately my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages kleopatra focuses on the famous queen s early years a period of time of which we have no record and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family \( something she may have compensated for in adulthood \) what i liked 1 \) the spelling of kleopatra cleopatra with a k it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection 2 \) kleopatra s strength of character essex s general characterization is appropriate and it s easy to see what kleopatra will become although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex it just didn t work for me the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far fetched and although i loved kleopatra s love interest \( i won t give away his name \) i felt it was a bit far fetched as well almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something kleopatra s dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe as was mohama there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit unnecessary overall although kleopatra was a strong believable character she was in the minority the novel as a sort of back story to the queen of egypt didn t work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction at least the sequel is better for fiction that works check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george,negative

this book is terribly organized i m not sure what happened in writing this book but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts people events are repeatedly referred to and then only later does jones bother to define them \( i would almost prefer that he not define something at all rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it \) the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me clearly the author publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate first reference to the concept examples are numerous but here are a few robe nobility referenced on pages 139 152 183 defined \( pg 183 \) sans culottes first referenced on page 189 defined on page 231 louis sebastien mercier referenced on pages 11 138 178 189 200 204 212 213 when did jones provide information \( that he was a journalist dramatist and observer of parisian mores \) on just who mercier is page 215 aside from that there are some plain old errors one such is in the text box on saint genevieve jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s she died in 512ad so the negotiations seem improbable \( 470s 480s would be correct but i should not have to figure that out \) the redeeming quality of the book is that if does offer information on paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances and paris is not such a bad subject,negative

the snow goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read set on the coast of england at the time of dunkirk it is less about the strife of wwii itself than about its three main characters one of whom is the snow goose and what binds them it is a story about nature love and nobility of spirit to say more would be to give too much away but it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades and i reread it when i need to be reminded what is important in life,positive

surely there s more to chinese youth culture than descriptions of affairs with tall western men being a fan of pearl buck s books on china i was looking for more contemporary accounts of chinese culture but this book was so dissapointing a goodlooking shangaiese woman gives vacuous details of her affair with a tall german man while her doped impotent chinese boyfriend simple wastes away \( why was he even in the story \) the writing is totaly lacking in any kind of talent i was willing to assume her glow was due to her romance than her shiseido face cream need i say more if you want to read an account of a totally self absorbed woman infatuted with caucasian men indulging in meaningless affairs which probably boosts her self esteem read this but there s nothing worthy about china or chinese culture in this,negative

man oh man i think this is one of the worst books i ve ever read if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars i would seriously half way through i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive i found the book bizarre unfocused and poorly written the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation the physics engineering psychology medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome only to have them dissipate and so on the characters don t even seem like real people for example the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles and only her ankles flashing below a curtain and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are how could someone know a person that well but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood or one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive as though he really thinks this will attract them c mon if the guys a nut \( and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking duck to them is nuts \) write him as a nut the whole way through don t make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book s climax the book s title isn t even explained for crying out loud thanatos means death in greek i believe but i could never understand what the author editors audience thought was dying i won t read this one again nor will i look for anything else by percy walker,negative
what this is an epic adventure it would be imappropriate to review the wot series when speaking of the prophesies of the dragon book it s also not really a supplement akin to say the monster manual for d d the only extra skills feats backgrounds etc are those directly related to npcs in the campaign what prophecies is designed to do is take a party of characters through their first six levels of adventuring which correspond roughly to the first six books of the series of novels the players are allowed to play a key behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have been scripted for many of the book s key characters it s a really ambitious undertaking players have to be given a compelling storyline feel like they re making a difference in a campaign that covers over a year of game time without letting them change what happens in the novels does it work i am currently gming this adventure on paper it looks really good some of the scenes especially in the later parts of the story look exciting moving even faile s cameo is perfect for example in practice though it s been an extremely frustrating experience first the early encounters \( as pointed out by another reviewer \) are unnecessarily difficult and add nothing to the plot as things progress the authors presume too much on the goals and motivations of the players there is one chapter for example where the introduction says something along the lines of upon entering the city the players will want to find \( a certain npc \) as soon as posible and will definitely want to investigate the actions of \( another npc \) the players in my campaign knew they wanted to talk to one of these guys eventually but the other one was off their radar completely throughout i ve had to improvise ways to keep them approximating the plot line of the campaign and by chapter 3 they re feeling very manipulated the campaign assumes the party wants to do nothing more than hunt down dark friends and expose evil plots and will take great personal risk and go through great hardship \( including at one point a monthlong trek through a winter wilderness without adequate provisions \) on the chance of thwarting same characters with any other motivations \( say a character modeled after mat or nynaeve in the books \) will feel forced into situations unnaturally there has been more than one point where one of the players saying i think this is where the plot wants us to go so in conclusion while this adventure is excellent in its dreams and scope and it s definitely better than something i could have designed myself but it will fail often fail as a game if you are intending to run a wot campaign buy this adventure read it so that you thoroughly understand its scope before you even let your players make up characters the characters need to be created to fit the story or the story won t work,negative

this book is poorly written and even more poorly edited the back cover states every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out it is a great statement but it is unfortunately not true page 6 so what formats can a script be saved as there are three main kinds of script files regular compiled script which is the native applescript file format and scripts saved as plain text or as applications on top of that os x added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called bundle bundles are folders that appear and behave as files you can read about them in chapter 23 i guess bundle is not a main format why is there a distinction between main formats and for lack of a better term minor formats i have no idea page 35 every class has a super class page 40 we saw that objects belong to classes and classes may have subclasses and super classes which sentence is correct page 43 when you work with an application that doesn t support the whose clause you have to settle for slower clumsier repeat loops repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book there is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in chapter 11 pages 321 343 i wanted to like this book but i do not i look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book because it does have potential to be great however the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing,negative

there are two different types of larkin poem the first type mostly written before 1955 are influenced by yeats and auden and are mediocre the second written when he found his voice are amongst the most wonderful works of english literature ever written so what was his voice basically that of twentieth century man atheistic obsessed with sex regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties he takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems but here s the really incredible thing he uses ordinary uncomplicated language no tricks no arcane allusions just plain english it can t be denied that the voice is bleak and it is too uncompromising for some however those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives,positive

mr dennett s book demonstrates the ignorance irrationality and dishonesty of humanists discussing the meaning of word materialsim professor dennett says in its scientific or philosophical sense it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial like a cartesian soul or ectoplasm or god the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance matter and whatever minds are supposedly made of \( p 302 \) philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism it is naturalism materialism is the view that all that exists is matter materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena \( in a quote below you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in \) it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist but he is certainly a naturalist concerning the proof of god s existence he trots out david hume s who made god which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof let s look at two quotes the first is at the end of the chapter belief in belief and the other at the beginning of the chapter morality and religion that is isn t it true that whether or not god exists religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy in the rule of law in free will the very widespread \( but far from universal \) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning \( p 245 \) without the divine carrot and stick goes this reasoning people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires beak their promises cheat on their spouses neglect their duties and so on there are two well known problems with this reasoning \( 1 \) it doesn t seem to be true which is good news since \( 2 \) is is such a demeaning view of human nature \( p 279 \) in the first chapter he mentions bulwark of morality and meaning but in the second chapter he leaves out meaning if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven what is our purpose is life whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief mr dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians there are worse things than divorcing your spouse disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said mr dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life the only miracle mentioned in mr dennett s book is the shroud of turin which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man since no one claims to know how the image got there it can be called a miracle however mr dennett does not tell us anything about it the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet,negative

this book is simply incredible a more stimulating book i couldn t imagine it s not that it told me so much i didn t know intuitively but seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home this is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically the world has changed neal gabler tells it like he sees it and has a lot of research to back up his views i love that he doesn t make judgements or try to press an opinion on the reader it s left up to you to decide how you feel about it all i find myself thinking of points he brought up throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in real life the only reason i didn t give it a 5 is because i wish it was a bit more in depth it s so engaging that i can imagine an entire college course being made from this book it is a book that s as entertaining as it is informative and that s the whole point,positive
doctor livingstone i presume is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history very few people however are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of dr david livingstone and henry morton stanley this book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together livingstone one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the nile river through a combination of bad luck poor planning disease weather natives etc livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika henry stanley a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place the perils of african exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader i found this book very similar in style and experience to undaunted courage \( which detailed the voyage of discovery undertaken by lewis and clark \) and river of doubt \( dealing with theodore roosevelt s exploration of the amazon basin if you enjoyed either of these books you will like this one as well if you read this book and enjoy it i highly recommend the other two,positive
the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends they are in fact historical fiction at its best whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy but to weave the stories into historic events the first six novels in the series \( that is all i have read though it appears that there are two or three more \) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend but the beauty of the books is in whyte s prose a scottish poet he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours these books will not insult your intelligence and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend,positive

this book started off very slowly for me i got pretty tired of the gender bending deception how could she be so stupid as to think he was stupid enough to believe his charade for that long in that close of company once the air was cleared the book picked up speed and ended quite well i give the book 4 stars because it did cause me to shed a few tears at one point all in all a very enjoyable read past about the halfway point,positive
i did not finish the book \( i got about 70 of the way through before i realized i could not bear to read one more page \) maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better but i doubt it this is the first time i can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book the characters were flat and plot went nowhere please there are million of books out there spare yourself and find something else to read anything,negative
i read a review of this in l a weekly which said that it was a lot of fun and entertaining in a sort of ironic way despite the fact that it became more slapstick at the end i read it and agreed for the most part except i felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier than i had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than i would have thought from the initial satirical tone the ending was a little over the top but it was an example of the kind of senseless fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives all in all i thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel,positive
i m a fan of dave barry i enjoy his column i enjoyed some of his books in the past and i bought this one with great anticipation boy was i disappointed the story is meaningless the characters are not interesting the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny do yourself a favor do not read this book i can t believe anyone recommends it,negative
the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she s such a boring character she s young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she doesn t enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job \( which she doesn t seem to enjoy \) was just a boring digression,negative
there is no doubt that antonia fraser s the journey is written in the author s usual wry witty and highly engaging style \( although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as lugubrious \) there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marie antoinette s shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable however i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions for one thing why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage what about sophie of anhalt zerbst \( catherine the great \) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land this sort of thing happened all the time it was what being a princess was all about i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi s impotence phimosis and surgery and all that she simplistically portrays him as being asexual which was not true because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed it but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion i must say it is a first fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character but i guess fraser does oh well it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy if the queen had had her way her descendant would be reigning today and that is just the reality of it for a better study of marie antoinette s relationship with her husband i would recommend vincent cronin s louis and antoinette as for better biographies of the queen let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english,negative
do you know how clever alan trachtenberg is i mean do you really really know because if not this book is for you trachtenberg s book is only superficially about indians or americans it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things because he is very clever you know in so far as this book has a thesis that it is it,negative
great book it get s you thinking my kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all i could ask for yes i worked but not until they were in school almost always part time and i did not use working as an excuse to not volunteer at school sports and generally be in my kids lives the point is really about your priorities do you instinctively put your kids needs first it s been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area we have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten now they are seniors you can instantly tell which parents were connected involved and had their priorities straight not all of them stayed home the whole time on and off i used to listen to dr laura frequently agreeing but many times not what i love is that she has an unpopular point of view and she s not going to let social financial or industry pressure dilute her message yes she s frequently abrasive so were many people who have made an impact in the course of events in this world if you are a parent with young children read the book at least it will give you important ideas to agree or disagree with,positive
leonaur ltd is publishing the definitive edgar rice burroughs 21st century editions these usually contain 2 books of the different erb major series in order thus far john carter pellucidar and carson of venus in the future possibly tarzan these books are handsome and my rating is mainly based on this the erb fan knows best about the rest of it this first volume of joh carter of mars contains 2 3 of the greatest science fiction fantasy trilogy ever what is nore remarkable is that these were published over 40 years before tolkien s lotr and over 50 before tolkien became fashionable a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars are erb s greatest work it is sad in a way that tarzan obscures erbs mars novels for the general public these books deserve to be beter known and it is astonishing no movie or tv adaptation has ever been attempted \( which might be a good thing after all \) if only steven spielberg or peter jackson were interested of course genre and erb aficionados have long know and cherised these great stories i wonder how many others were first attracted to these by the magnificent ballantine editions of the 1960s if you are a fan as am i support leonaur ltd s efforts by buying these magnificent books,positive
this book is for the diehard dave navarro fans only the only reason i gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative the text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist neil straus approached writing the dirt with motley crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested this book falls short unless i would have been inclined to want to see things dave s way i grew restless of this pretty quickly,negative

i was barely able to finish this book armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches etc by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of this made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously i might have been able to swallow the idea of cabals \( giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors it s unclear why they don t just take over the world and have done \) but armstrong really lost me during the 20 page extended send up of anne rice s vampires this genre is rapidly sinking into self referentialism and armstrong is the worst culprit in industrial magic she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is on top of that the viewpoint character paige is unfortunately named she s as flat and boring as the pages she s written on her central relationship is with her boyfriend lucas but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors are we supposed to think this is cute and funny take home project for armstrong next time try putting some genuine emotion into your work,negative
this book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security global warming etc as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells the author contributes little to previous books on the subject such as rikin s book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public if anything the book s original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms in doing so the author comes up with some interesting case studies but it s quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of the economist which happens to be the author s employer moreover there was little effort in integrating the various chapters overall a very disapointing book the author should stick to journalism,negative

i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican funny he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement and let s face it he stink bombed george h w bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton i m not saying bush would have won if walsh hadn t indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election but walsh made a next to impossible task unattainable for bush bush got him back of course by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve 1992 the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least as it wore on however it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans let s face it people in power tend to be corrupt they have protection the rest of us don t have this wasn t just true about reagan and bush it s true about clinton and whoever you wish to name about halfway through the book walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time ghw bush i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least i guess when you can t beat a guy at the ballot box you impeach him or at least try to right not worth the investment of time or money but does have some good historical information inside,negative

many reviewers compared this novel to jurassic park saying it was a better book than crichton s what absurdity i am not saying that jp is an awesome book but it was far better than tyrannosaur canyon tyrannosaur canyon is a fairly intriguing story but poorly executed and very poorly ended it s as though preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in and didn t know how to do it the ending is too fast too unlikely and too unrealistic the book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters which i believe is preston s way of attempting to belong to both camps having his science and being religious overall i had high hopes for this book and i am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages i was greatly let down,negative

i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum s book the sigma protocol it says in ludlum s latest an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy well gee that s the plot of this book as well come to think of it that s the plot of every book by the man that i ve read a vast right wing conspiracy is set to take over the world they have small armies a lot of money and a plan this time around a group of military men \( naturally \) plan to foment terror and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world \( laugh not millions in the middle east and far left believe 9 11 was something along the same lines \) enter ordinary man joel converse he s a vietnam vet and p o w who thought he had left that life far behind it s up to him to save the world he will survive certain death several times \( the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger \) he will find love and he ll visit several european cities to boot of course a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels \( how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side \) but ludlum s cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn t write his dialogue writing is always tedious and sometimes just painful to read action scenes are generic the only thing he could do right is character background but that s not enough to save this the aquitaine progression might make a half decent tv movie but to endure 700 pages is just too much,negative
i finished it because a friend recommended it but had she not i would have quit after page 20 i wasn t interested in the story or writing i didn t find the story grotesque i ve read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book but i just didn t find the protagonist very interesting he went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation we learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs to redeem himself his actions didn t seem out of line either during the war or during the plague given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences i know this is a great example of a book written in second person and perhaps for that it is worth reading i wouldn t pick it up for enjoyment or leisure,negative

i had to read this book for a political theory class in college after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with the book is also not organized well in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights to be honest i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her still i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories in short i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure or intellectual curiosity if you have to read the rights of others for a class i extend my condolences,negative

i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d macdonald style just because that s what film going audiences like i do not think this is a bad thing but i like some of the reviewers here are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i e macdonald s cape fear or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof as for her writing style she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown what we re left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents davy his fiancee and to some extent lani who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone challenged the men in this novel just weren t credible when they spoke i kept seeing jance speaking for them so we re left with a high concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker what s the tohono o otham word for 2 thumbs down quot,negative

this is one of the finest popular histories i have ever read whether it is a book about 5th and 6th century british history using arthur as a organizing principle or a book about the real arthur using 5th and 6th century history as a backdrop this book is wholly convincing concerning the reality of arthur and the historical context in which he lived the book may actually be too good the most convincing evidence it cites the so called british easter annals appear to have been called into question by subsequent scholarship and the link between arthur and mount badon is not quite as convicing as it seeme to be when alcock wrote the book in short this masterpiece needs updating but a masterpiece it is no one who reads this book with any care can fail to come away from it without a vastly improved understanding not only of the british dark ages but of the nature of historical evidence scholarship and truth this is a great book,positive
hard to figure why sean stewart isn t one of the most beloved writers in america given the virtuoso performance he s demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic character he s created in will kennedy a combination horror fantasy work which is as reminiscent of a confederacy of dunces as it is ghosts by hynd this novel is filled with so much warmth and life that it s hard to remember that this actually is a story about a man who understands that the past too can be a ghost and perhaps the worst kind perfect circle is everything every other supposed 5 star horror novel featured on amazon is supposed to be well written compelling with rich empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its own it s a wonderful introduction to mr stewart s work,positive
this book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life it combines something of the science the personalities and the history of this field for general readers with some technical sophistication it affords an opportunity to broaden one s horizons without too much of a mathematical stretch for computer scientists who are thinking of their own research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the field and a place to start delving into the original research papers read it and enjoy the future,positive
there s nothing unique about this text all the topics discussions have been well covered in other basic textbooks on corporate finance mergers etc the discussions lack depth the whole concept of corporate strategy has been miscontrued by the authors the link between this and financial markets is very ambiguous blur fyi i m a businessman hold an mba in finance from an international university,negative
this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother s death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is it can never match the perception of others one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice and meursault s response was it was the human justice that put me here no matter what acts you commit whether they be henous incensitive or loving one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change his fate with this i dont even have a chance to survive not even a slim one,positive
unfortunately for all the name brand that this book conveys i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales boggles this readers mind the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book i would be astounded save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation by the way those giving 5 stars either can t read english very well or are shills for mckinsey,negative
first off anyone who gave this book five stars was employed by the publisher to up the rating that simple i mean look at some of them they are so cheesy one of them actually refers to the author as mr miller who is he brown nosing for sounds like a greeting card they are so textbooky and insincere the book itself is almost entirely filler on how to read music \( which half the music books in borders are or they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short \) up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when i asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along the problems with this is everything is assumed in the entire field i recommend the only book that i have found that made some sense to me called fractals in music by charles madden much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning working into more and more complex shapes and structures,negative
the author is a journalist but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right wing think tank like business elites the author basically does not particularly like democracy in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas even authoritarians if needed he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism based on laws rights especially property rights separation of powers with much of that power being held in unelected bodies and most of all free market capitalism he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits most in the west do care rights and legal systems are not neutral the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment though the author s real target is us society he looks at the results of democracy over the world and of course he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn t work a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us in the us the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years in actuality he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism in this era elites in finance business law banking health care various media etc have likewise been swept up in fact are the driving force in a money first culture he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal mart and the like represents democratic empowerment the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal mart juggernaut he especially decries direct citizen actions he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets however he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes it s hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century and their heirs should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums if citizens had actually been democratically empowered such distortions of the political process could have been prevented the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites no rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy not buttressed it if the author put journalism first instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process actually foiling democracy first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system distorting and muting all challenging ideas it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez faire free market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free trade agreements worker visa programs massive immigration out of control energy policies broken health care systems huge cutbacks in various safety net programs massive redistribution of wealth upwards the gutting of our manufacturing base etc the list could go on informed empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy but is in the throes of democratic failure which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book americans are supposedly fiercely democratic yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule even anti democratic generals if need be the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment,negative
i haven t completed the book yet but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable it begins in genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read bible sections to the not so often or seldom read sections he ends everyday with a thought provoking question to think on through out the rest of your day i always look for to the next reading,positive

this book has a lot of information about how protecting wild areas works in wa and and an overview of the protections offered by the united states government it then provides the inspiration to get people started through true stories of grassroots projects while the book doesn t list 1 2 3 what needs to be done to start a grassroots movement that shouldn t be expected because all people have different motivations and this book should be used as a tool to help you understand the basics of how these sorts of movements work a must for anyone who wants to further understand washington state for all of its great wild places or anyone for that matter that is looking for inspiration on why wild areas should be protected plus all of the proceeds go to a great cause,positive
it was just that dry and boring i never really connected with any of the characters i gave up reading about 3 4ths of the way through,negative
this is a very thorough very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states and while it may not be as easily readable as say david mccullough s truman it is certainly less dry and slow going than most scholarly works if you re looking for a full life biography of monroe one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure s life this is an excellent choice if you re looking for light reading with a historical basis this is definitely not what you re looking for,positive
deyoung begins by relating how bush pushed powell out at the end of his 1st term without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him making matters worse was the fact that bush didn t even know why powell was at the white house when it came time to say good bye colin powell came from jamaican parents \( often called jewmaicans by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education \) and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little if any racial prejudice later on unfortunately the insults were quite aggravating but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny \( majored in geology \) however rotc piqued his sophomore year interest and he soon became a standout powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet and top graduate \( or very close \) in every military training setting he undertook as well as a top mba student at george washington university he also was top ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment leading to his being offered a white house fellowship which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs national security advisor and secretary of state one of powell s secrets of success was to enthusiastically implement all orders even those he considered silly powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others unfortunately powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney \( a bit of a problem during gulf war i a serious problem when cheney became v p \) between cheney s far right bias \( out on the looney fringe per powell \) and bush ii s disturbingly disjointed decision making per treasury secretary o neill \) powell s contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded often with don rumsfeld s help in addition he was often left out of important decisions especially when out of the country ultimately powell s credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u n speech attesting to saddam s wmd the big question still debated is why didn t he resign his supporters believe the reason is that powell s nature simply didn t allow anything less than 100 support bottom line if cheney had not been such an ideologue \( telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v p ignoring powell and then sliding into the position himself \) powell would be v p today possibly president in 2008 similarly if bush 41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in 92 powell might well have become first v p and then president,positive
if you want to read a book that s exciting happy and mind blowing you should read small steps from the author that brought you holes louis sachar is at his best this book is sort like a sequel to holes the main character armpit is stuck in a situation which he can not handle he is in the heat in austin texas and i think it is making him do crazy illegal things at first he did not know what he was doing was wrong but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail i think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above both boys and girls would enjoy this book i think they should make a movie out of the book it would get outstanding remarks this is one out of few books that i could read over and over again,positive

what a chore this book was to read if it weren t for my ocd about finishing books that i start i would ve read the first couple of chapters and then given up it seems like a wannabe suspense but it s not it seems like there might be a love story in it but there s not it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it but there is not what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she s going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy she tries to make a connection but falls way short read vinegar hill that one was worth it pass midnight champagne by,negative

first off this book is very entertaining to read unlike many political books it is never tedious or redundant thieves in high places is an accurate portrayal of what is wrong with both parties in america it is also informative and insightful on the roles of big corporations in american politics and local economies this book is a call to arms against large corporations that put locally owned businesses under companies that use child labor overseas and the entire americal political system this book empowers the common man in his fight for an egalitarian society fair wages for all and a real equal oppurtunity at an education i loved this book it was a pleasure to read and confirmed everything that disuades me about america today it is worth a read,positive

lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president this book shows that this is not even close to being true under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle class while giving the rich more money it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency,positive
piglia muestra que es un explorador de nuevas formas narrativas pero la lectura de este libro y de otros suyos nos deja ver a un autor que no se deja leer con facilidad que es cr ptico debe ser leido con mucha atenci n con papel y lapiz en la mano para seguir sus tramas y personajes y eso no es un virtud en un escritor,positive

i assume the plot of this famous tale is well known so i won t spend time on it but in recently re reading this book for the first time since ninth grade english class in the 90 s i was repeatedly struck by a piercing question how exactly over time does drama become melodrama will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred forty years hence how does this happen and is there ever an end point to it dickens was by any standard a literary master and if typifying one s age is a virtue then he does this to perfection yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time \( as other writers have done \) is a limitation then in this one sense alone charles dickens has an achilles heel,positive
i first picked up this book because i ve always been interested in what young writers have to say but i have to admit even i was a little surprised this story mind the mythicism is a real representation of what young children s minds sometimes go through that idea of a person you fabricated gaining more reality than necessary congrats to ms oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about she is one i ll keep in my mind for a while if you like young writers you should check out charles hedji s fields of discovery i m an avid reader once again,positive

pest control is a light hearted book which uses a fast pace and off the wall humor to make up for any depth problems standard story upstart assassin bursts onto the scene creating mayhem in the world of professional killers problem upstart assassin can t even fulfill a contract to rid a restaurant of roaches let alone kill some of the most guarded men in the world the story of bob dillon s flirtation with contract killers is a page turner not really out of suspense because you can t imagine that fitzhugh would subject his characters to anything other than a fairy tale ending but out of unabated curiosity you want to know how in the heck dillon and his cohorts will survive to breed another strain of hybrid bug eating bugs of course fitzhugh answers with simple and hilarious solutions which are towards the end of the book more and more absurd and predictable overall i m slightly embarrassed that i like this book as much as do nonetheless i would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy and humorous read,positive

this very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book it chronicals the life of a young scottish woman forced to live first in china then japan well written and historically accurate it s obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture customs history and life style of japan this makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story for all who ve ever lived in japan it s a believable tale that literally makes you feel you ve stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern japan for those who haven t lived in japan believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind because of this he s able to focus on his character versus scene setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind the timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life a gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her when the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue but even good books must end be prepared to sit a spell once you start reading you ll find it hard to put down,positive
the text gets 5 stars for the orientation organization and the on line resources for the text it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course unfortunately i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make this has been frustrating for my students as well as myself however i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market i strongly recommend a new corrected edition,negative

i read this book 2 years ago and still consider it one of the most compelling and important books i have ever read besides being completely absorbed by this man s life and experiences i learned so much valuable information about cambodia from it that i wish it was required reading for anyone traveling there blended seamlessly with the narrative you will learn of the history and culture of the cambodians the groundwork for the rise of the khmer rouge the horrors and fallacies of life under a communist regime and the story of pol pot i also gained an insight into buddhist thought and daily life in cambodia all of which prepared me well for my trip there haing ngor s life story also helped me understand the damaging psychological consequences endured by the victims of this holocaust and of the difficulties cambodians have had in trying to adjust to life in america there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this book and many which can give us a better ability to analyze current international events if you read no other book about cambodia read this one,positive

i ve read and enjoyed all the starfist novels this is one of them in name only it starts like a typical starfist novel and even ties in some references to charlie bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends i never did figure out what the author s point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash the men of the fist are hard working hard fighting marines who trace an honorable history back to the us marines of the 19th 20th century these force recon marines are a ruthless bunch of screw ups who could trace their ancestry back to the waffen ss rather than root for them i soon found myself rooting for the opposition they invade a fellow member of the confederation screw up their primary assignment fail to get the info they were sent for kill allied soldiers and airmen murder helpless civilian prisoners and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state someone should remind the authors that recon is about getting accurate timely information it s not about blowing things up i really wasted my money on this book i definitely won t be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle,negative
john updike s literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written every one of his non fiction collections is worth reading but his novels have from the very first been precious over written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation when he writes fiction he s like a dog doing tricks for reward and certainly the rewards have come but for readers outside the us at least it s all a little mystifying john cheever was a far better writer yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by americans as the lesser canon time will correct this mistake no doubt but in the meantime updike pours out ever more cloying and over heated work like this if i still have your attention let me recommend the collected stories of john cheever updike could only dream of writing prose like that,negative
the sun shines planets orbit corporations lie voraciously humans consume mindlessly and noam chomsky the pre eminent intellectual of the modern era churns out knowledge elucidates the times and refutes the notion that it is our manifest destiny to perpetually suffer indignity in a wide ranging series of question and answer sessions chomsky tackles a myriad of seemingly disparate topics which ultimately pertain to and concern the economic and political system and the welfare of humanity unlike books authored by chomsky himself which tackle specific topics understanding power the indispensable chomsky is the transcript of sessions traversing a decade during which chomsky takes questions from the audience on a number of topics ranging from us foreign policy imperialism trade and the third world to propaganda corporate media solutions to the collective malaise and the march towards a more just system and society expounding on his legendary encyclopaedic knowledge and command of logic professor chomsky manages to offer the questioners and by extension the readers a radical approach distinct from the boilerplate and mind numbing discussions of the corporate media refuting the suitability of handling our problems by working within the system and nibbling at the edges chomsky offers an alternative to the broken system without resorting to the expected customary answers like a broken record as thoughtful and brilliant as the discourse is the book s editors also deserve much praise not only for the compilation but also for the easy to read format and the lively pace of the book understanding power could easily have been entitled understanding the system and is a brilliant book based on the profound teachings of a brilliant thinker,positive

time to pack up my luggage \( wouldn t it be nice to have a suitcase like rincewind s \) and take off for discworld while the rain and gloom of a january thaw engulf the northern hemisphere guards guards is the eighth book in the discworld series in which captain sam vimes of ankh morpork s night watch gives up drinking and gets married \( just the opposite of most folks \) i don t read the discworld novels in order any more just pick up a favorite and start in the blurbs on the back and cover pages compare pratchett to charles dickens \( pratchett is better \) chaucer j r r tolkien with a sharper more satiric edge and p g wodehouse i think any author who garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in a category by himself heck pratchett is a category by himself so on to ankh morpork where the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren decides with a little prompting from its supreme grand master to conjure up a dragon the dragon will cause enough death and property damage \( including a vegetable stand and a brother in law s shiny new carriage \) so that when the supreme grand master s nephew rides into the city with his sharp shiny sword and slays the beast the grateful citizens will proclaim him king this plot works rather well except that the dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would be slayer its requirements are simple and traditional one well bred virgin per month and all of the gold silver and jewels in ankh morpork for its hoard the new regime fires sam vimes from his job as captain of the night watch how he wonders could things get worse well at least he s not a virgin and no one is talking to him in capital letters,positive
the only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle the rest is just quotations from other books there is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half the author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said i read it to the end though probably because the author has a very nice writing style he is probably a good playwrite though i have never read any of his plays he just didn t have enough material for a book here i m surpised it got published,negative
what could have been a hilarious informative account of breaking outlandish old fashioned laws and getting \( or not getting \) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young british guys \( i think the author is around 23 \) wryly making fun of america s perceived backwardness sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and when they couldn t they outright gave up on some great chances the swedish girls in frisco why include it if it didn t come to fruition and furthermore involved no lawbreaking i m still wondering why they included their 2 page tour of hearst castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log \( cool hearst had greco roman statues in his poolroom \) they don t get arrested and they don t really accomplish anything too bad,negative

the story walk across the sea by susan fletcher takes place at a town near the ocean white people thought themselves superior to others especially the chinese chinese were often looked down upon and shunned mainly because of their religious beliefs the lighthouse keeper s daughter however was different from other white people believing her father s talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story the girl eliza jane meets a chinese boy around her age after the chinese boy saves her goat eliza becomes interested in the boy s behavior soon she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed this story was rather interesting in a way the time of the story show how the characters act and think the story also shows how different some characters are such as eliza s father and mother \( something moved inside me like a sudden shift in the wind \) eliza was also in a way different from other white people she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy \( you ll do him no harm i have your word on it \) i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy of all of the stories i have read i have never found one that was perfect this story is no different when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt the story however has a few more bad parts one boy amos accidentally broke eliza jane s nose while trying to find the chinese boy afraid that he might get in trouble the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza s nose to make matters worse amos blames the fault on the chinese boy \( i had a mind to shout at him to tell him to put her down \) on the other hand i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met when the boy yelled a warning eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat therefore when the boy was holding the goat eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave even so that was not the worst part of the story \( get you from me he said i can t be near you now get out of my sight \) as a father eliza s father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend and maybe even understand why she was protecting him as a result i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her thankfully there was nothing worse than this part of the story \( terrible things can happen in this world things you can t explain away it s not safe here andrew john i can t promise you ll be safe but there are miracles too like you and love and glories well beyond our knowing \) the ending where eliza talks to her baby brother about life and the chinese boy was my favorite part it ties everything together and concludes the story about friendship,positive

the book jacket for the ruins offers a can t miss premise a group of post grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger it s the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach but 319 pages later the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket almost immediately you ll notice that smith s writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting however despite the endless stream of words his descriptions are often threadbare plus there are no chapter breaks which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue next the characters themselves begin to fall flat there are only really two couples to keep track of and yet it s difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them there is little to keep you interested in what they re doing or why they might be doing it smith s attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts this seems obviously haphazard and hurried the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam by the end of the book the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them and for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as mayan mythology or archeological lore forget it aside from language barriers with the locals there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn t have been set in the wilds of the rocky mountains the saharan desert or anywhere else the danger posed has nothing to do with mexico archeology or mythology at all ah yes the danger posed well i can t say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation that s how thin the plot is the numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is \( and you ll realize it well before any of the well educated characters do \) it s a real eye roller as if to say i read this many pages for this by the time the story concludes it s more irritating than suspenseful the characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you ll start rooting against them eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action but even aside from being misdirected it s too little too late this book could have been an adventure a supernatural thriller a survival tale or a horror screenplay it could have even taken the high road as an examination on people s reactions to situations of extreme stress some take the lead even enjoying the challenge while others whither into a shell of hopelessness but none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort,negative
that about says it all bill bryson is a hilarious writer i like reading grammar books anyway but i was always excited to read this book as it s so entertaining besides that it can teach \( or remind \) you of a lot of good rules of writing the main problem is that several entries are unnecessary and some necessary entries are left out,positive

i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you re facing in your own relationships are commonplace they re not dysfunctional every family has its share of issues and you don t need to feel overly guilty for yours the book s underlying theme is that families that honesty consideration character belief and perhaps above everything else resilience can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it s probably \( though not always \) worth the effort stories include resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead \( and the effect on kids \) dealing with the families of your in laws and family objection to marriage how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you dealing with the death of a child how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing etc although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life \( with all it s frustrations and headaches \) and balance it with everything if you have any relationship friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration resignation about then i strongly recommend this book it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time it could change your relationships and your life,positive

i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others hoping to learn about america s prison system i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic unfortunately in the first twenty pages of the book elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10 000 citizens if you do the math that equals 7 of our population 7 of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york according to this author there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york before you get too worried let me reassure you that this is not the case america imprisons 736 people per 100 000 citizens \( as of 5 06 \) or 736 of the population this is the highest rate in the entire world so there s no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic for comparison stalin had 771 of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges again there s really no need to exaggerate america s rate of incarceration what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page but is repeated several times apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7 of our population and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover personally i can t take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out on the first twenty pages no less if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 how do we know the rest of the book isn t off by a power of 10 elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine don t buy this book,negative

i didn t discover the delight that is the artemis fowl series until a week ago when i read artemis fowl in one day so of course i had to pick up a copy of the arctic incident right away to see if it was as good as the first it definitely is and in my own humble opinion i think i liked it even better than the first book there are points throughout the book where artemis now thirteen shows a softer more vulnerable side that i truly enjoyed don t get me wrong he s still an evil genius but he s an evil genius with heart and you can t help but love him now that angeline fowl is out of her depression thanks to some fairy magic from captain holly short she s sent artemis back to saint bartelby s school for young gentlemen in ireland artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school s counselor dr po when he gets an urgent message from butler his bodyguard butler majordomo it seems that artemis fowl the first is alive in russia being held for ransom by the russian mafiya young artemis of course immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father it s been almost two years since artemis senior was last heard from and his son is most eager to bring him home before he can work out a devious scheme though he s visited by none other than captain short and her superior commander root and brought down to haven city and into police plaza it seems the goblin triad the b wa kell have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling and artemis the second is quite justly i believe suspected of being that human the fairies soon realize however that this time artemis fowl isn t the bad guy in this problem but now they d like artemis and butler s help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the mud men and artemis is quite willing to help them out in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father what follows is an action packed story of good versus evil below ground with deceptions backstabbing and revenge taking center stage as holly root butler and artemis race to save haven city from being destroyed some of the same characters from the first book make appearances foaly mulch diggums cudgeon and captain trouble there s also a new foe in the arctic incident opal koboi to be dealt with i highly recommend the artemis fowl series to anyone and everyone highly enjoyable thoroughly entertaining and not soon forgotten,positive

this book was given to me by my cousin who thought i might find faith after hearing the eulogy i gave at my father s funeral a year ago in which i professed that i do not know if there is a god or not but that the best we can do is be good people i am agnostic in that i am fully aware that there is no factual evidence that god exists and that there is no evidence that god does not exist to be clear if there was i am pretty sure it would be widely publicized the gift was a loving gesture and i am sincerely appreciative of it however i have several issues with the book more than i can possibly iterate at this point this book does not even mention agnosticism as the author was educated at yale i am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book i can only presume that it was omitted with a reason perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for god \( see below all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith \) without getting into too many specifics the evidence he uses in the case for faith comes from obviously christian sources which are surely biased this is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists certainly one s reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities to be clear i am only drawing this distinction to make the point a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion had strobel intended to provide a balanced view he would have used non christian scientists and believers of various faiths strobel s statements portend to be fact but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect a couple of examples are 1 \) his statement that buddhism says there is no god \( various sects of buddhism believe in gods state there is no creator god or do not take a stand on the matter \) and 2 \) his statements on lack of evidence for evolution specifically macroevolution \( which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation and believed to be accurate by 99 of biologists \) regarding evolution there is actually evidence for macroevolution although he claims there is none this is where i have serious problems with the book in my opinion the book is more for current believers who need desire to strengthen their faith which i believe is a good thing however his information lacks factual support and evidence which to me is a bad thing i believe that most of the people who would read it would not get to the point of questioning the information in it if one were to question it one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true \( and which subsequently was the basis for faith \) is found to be false he states that there is evidence for intelligent design however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense i e a guess the theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense i e supported by on observation and evidence another example is when strobel quotes when it comes right down to it the only person or thing i know of worth my faith the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience is jesus the buddha \( meaning one who is awake \) or siddhartha gautama \( his real name \) was an actual person supported by all of the above listed proof of jesus mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above his 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation \( for regular people \) 1 \) if james loses 3 pounds he is still james if he becomes a grasshopper he is not james because he is not human 2 \) support for past lives such as memories are explainable by psychological explanations lucky guesses or demonic possession 3 \) the only expert on this question jesus of nazareth said it doesn t happen to respond 1 \) to believe in resurrection one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our earthly form it is not tied to being human but to existing 2 \) how do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists there is factual evidence for neither 3 \) to be in line with this reason one must already accept the divinity of jesus and that the resurrection actually happened his arguments for the truth of the resurrection \( below \) are weak and offer no support for the fact only that people claimed it happened we should not confuse the fact that jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of god and specifically that he was reincarnated here are his proof that god exists 1 \) god makes sense of the universe s origin 2 \) god makes sense of the universe s complexity 3 \) god makes sense of moral values \( his argument is if there are absolute moral values then god must exists god makes sense of the resurrection \( see proof below \) 4 \) god can be immediately experienced to respond 1 \) theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality but are not truly an explanation of reality one still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion while it may explain questions about the universe how do we know it to be accurate put another way there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe additionally one presumes he is speaking of the christian god and discounting other belief systems 2 \) see my first objection same point 3 \) science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions the basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone to take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of god requires faith he gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values he omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving while i do believe that things are wrong one can easily recognize that they are not always absolute for example it is not ok to kill unless you are in danger or the other person killed others \( presuming you believe in capital punishment \) 4 \) his example here is that you cannot prove the world exists fair enough but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again for example we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results \( barring psychological conditions \) while we may not be able to prove that the world exists we can confirm common experience which is essentially what the world is the ground on which we all interact whether or not that is created in the mind \( the example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of the world may only be in our mind \) proof jesus was resurrected 1 \) the location of jesus burial was widely known and agreed on 2 \) the sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty which is agreed upon by many \( or all \) 3 \) various groups of people experienced appearances of jesus alive again 4 \) the original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that jesus was risen from the dead even enough to die for this belief to respond 1 \) this is fact and jesus did exist not sure how it relates to his divinity 2 \) this could be explained in several ways hard to use this as proof of his divinity one can suppose it is but it takes a leap of faith this book is supposed to explain how to have faith but continually requests we make leaps of faith 3 \) writings of people who claims to experience jesus can hardly be taken as fact other religious text would claim the same about their prophets gods etc 4 \) the disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of jesus this is not actual evidence this is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true additionally strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical in dealing with objection 5 strobel notes that the descriptions of hell in the bible are metaphorical it is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical it is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding i am not sure how you justify doing this he states that only one religion can be right or god is schizophrenic one supposes his assertion is that christianity is the one true religion or god is schizophrenic this again is a leap of faith one must also presume that the various religions are not human error in interpreting god s message my stand is this we do not know and to have faith is great however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false biased information a false faith is created faith should be born out of one s desire and belief system one should not need to discount others because of their faith to me doing so indicates weakness in their faith not strength,negative

i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted even this was sparse at best he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it however it became too watered down and even lost me lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments pushing the envelope of science should be award enough for these reasons i can not recommend this book,negative
i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe then another meanwhile fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose ninety percent of the books i ve read have been secular but i m starting to read more christian novels but to me this book fails for three reasons the marriage conflict between mark and allie isn t believable the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing mark and allie s marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn t convinced her otherwise seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery but it is grounds for suspicion yet allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight instead mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie throughout the book references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie allie refers to mark s act as adultery and recalls him lying his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie their marriage is struggling but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book mark says he didn t have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies later in the novel blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late the serial killer story is poorly done and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book when they book a suspect at the end it seems ridiculous the police work feels like it was written by an amateur one line in the novel as much as the evidence pointed to xxx stan didn t want to believe it in my opinion the evidence didn t point to that person and stan the detective seems foolish for believing it there isn t any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story there is no sense of setting in the book there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other finally this book talks about god and prayer and being saved throughout the book and that s great with a serial killer on the loose a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way at one point a conversation goes like this how can the murder be part of god s plan maybe it isn t that would mean god isn t in control he is in control but he allows some things to happen then at another point mark says to allie i m going to be fine it s time to trust the lord he s taken care of us so far then allie says but i don t know what his plan is i don t know how he wants this to end i don t know what he wants to teach us at other points in the book characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god s plan and that through god s plan all things can be used for good this line of logic is infuriating bad things happen to everyone including god s people god doesn t allow a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife that s a horrible message to send to a non christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck telling them it was part of god s plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians but like above where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson god doesn t willfully kill people it comes down to the simple fact that all people including serial killers and christians have choices to make and have free will i m surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book,negative
i wanted to like this book i enjoyed the first two in the series but this one left me a bit dry babylon rising the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips this continues the story of michael murphy a college professor teaching biblical archaeology he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of the handwriting on the wall from the days of daniel he s falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him and there are a few attempts on his life mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon murphy for someone who s pretty much a small fish in the large ocean finds himself in the middle of all this as i said i really wanted to like this book the murphy character is likeable and i enjoyed the action but the plotline was spotty and over the top murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him \( highly unlikely \) everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time \( over the top \) the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel and they didn t do either one especially well murphy s growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the she s so beautiful and could she be interested in me interludes and finally none of the plotlines wrapped up you got to the end and thought so fine if you re ready to read the next installment but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one part of me wants to be nice give the book the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 3 but the authors are better than this and i ve come to expect more from someone who s been doing this for a long time if you re committed to the series you ll want have need to read it but just don t come in with your expectations very high,negative

this book contains the childhood memoirs of peter reich as the son of psychoanalyst wilhelm reich peter led a bizarre life he lived with his parents on the family estate of orgonon in the backwoods of maine not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy as wilhelm s only child peter was one of the first recipients of reich s therapy methods which involved special forms of touch energy channeling softening the stomach and inducing vomiting \( in peter s account \) peter was also made lieutenant in his father s defensive squad that protected the earth from ufo attacks through the use of accumulator guns the elder reich eventually got in trouble with the fda for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness the court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court not long after being sent to prison he passed away apparently of heart failure upon his father s death peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father s legacy of brilliance and madness up until the time of his father s death he had believed everything his father told him not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father s version of reality was from most other people s nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father s explanations and standard scientific approaches in this book peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not what is his and what is his father s the book reads like the proverbial onion chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another sometimes it s hard to tell if what peter is describing actually took place or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head by the end of the book the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in peter s mind but like peter may not be capable of saying what really happened in any case this is very much a book about peter reich and not wilhelm reich although readers who want to learn more about wilhelm reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son who experienced them first hand and without question,positive

american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he couldn t let go of his sense of responsibility for her,negative

his fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow there is some wisdom here and there but not worth the headache you ll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head here is an example if you say your own name to yourself at such a moment it will seem utterly alien you will then understand the sacrament of baptism huh at first i thought his writing may just be over my head but after re reading most of it i realized it was just bad it s like the whole book was written when he was high or something some very good ideas but most can be found in other better written books,negative

the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation why could the equation not be solved there is a reason for this fact and the mathematical theory explains it well but not this book perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book but apparently not in this one,negative
written in cartoon format i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight dry biography of scientists however it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known so using it as an initial reading is impossible further some content is offensive on the second page of cartoons a scientist is walking along a bridge thinking when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump saying no woman is worth committing suicide over the pictures show a scantily clad woman \( with bare bottom in one frame \) that he is now picturing in his mind irrelevant and inappropriate plus i didn t have to go far to find swear words in the captions yikes my kids will never see this book it is not even appropriate for high school age kids \( in fact it isn t even funny to adults,negative
thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we re reading a story we like to look for clues in what we ve read to help us unravel the plot and find out who did it and why the crime was done john grisham cheats us out of that fun the villian of this book isn t introduced until there less than 75 pages left which means that when you get that far you realize that everything you read before then wasn t valid to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings that s bad read another thriller instead of this one one that plays by the rules,negative

first off i loved the book cover spine and all one of my all time favorites it s what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward facing covers on the store s front table then the title i loved that just as much both share the characteristics of being straightforward to the point and revealing both are perfectly simple i read most the essays and came to think that a this guy really does his homework and b he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi i constantly begged for my dictionary it s probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up an intellectual snob i guess he got that from the oprah incident but i also guess that there s lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career what s up with this culture that it s so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon the attraction to franzen s work is that he investigates and reveals in a binary way he s researching facts he s listening to feelings he s processing both to give an opinion the best example of this is my father s brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father s brain there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss reading it you sympathize you empathize and you learn equally as insightful are lost in the mail a look into possible reasons behind chicago s underperforming mail system the reader in exile a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading first city a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities meet me in st louis a piece that shares the two sided feelings in a trio of situations \( including the oprah incident \),positive

i haven t done this in awhile but i don t think i could review this piece any better than the other reviews i ve read about it it s pretty average however filled with nice bits of knowledge they didn t seem well researched in some areas here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other critics that i agree with they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences would be enough john gallant biased against superheros \( sic \) christopher ritter i found this book to be tedious lacking in charm badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas c p halliday i picked up this book lawrance m bernabo their belief seems to be that donald duck was the best comic book ever m g bloedorn pretty boring bernardz a black hole is hypothesized lending a faint respectability to the premise behind green lantern s abilities peter vinton jr this book will not satisfy full on fans james n simpson gave it five stars a chance to laugh about the heroes i still love and that mean so much to me reviewer man there s a whole 200 pages of this pooh poohing cranky old maid kind of stuff mark alfred they were even putting words into c darwin s mouth aaron spriggs mildly entertaining but not great reviewer when the man \( dean koontz in this case \) writing the introduction says he doesn t read comics i began to get worried ivan a wolfe i agree with an earlier poster reviewer almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible plastic larry the authors give us a more plausible \( given what we know now \) origin for the hulk involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification j draper carlson this book is not mean spirited or nasty reviewer superman s powers break the laws of science ooh stop the presses interesting rick hunter the science of superheroes reviewer,negative

if you don t know much more about woodrow wilson than an overview of the important events of his life this book isn t going to help much there s very little political analysis almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties wilson needed to overcome and no passion at all in the writing actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade auchincloss talks a bit about the two wilsons \( one good one bad \) and hints at wilson s dependance on women but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently maybe woodrow wilson s life is just too large for a book this small,negative

the setting of this book is beautiful exotic and interesting the author unfortunately does nothing to take advantage of this i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year which i doubt the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else as far as i am concerned i can t imagine it being done worse tuck s writing style short vignettes or episodes one after another is terribly ineffective and disjointed i felt completely detached from all of the characters i didn t feel like i gained any understanding of who they were and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies another thing that completely irritated me were tuck s sexual references throughout the novel tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter \( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest for example \) these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader all they did was gross me out they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story i don t know what tuck was trying to do in this novel i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level it is not entertaining it is not profound it is not educational it is not beautiful at only 248 pages i can t say it was even a quick read utterly forgettable once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it,negative
the author has her narrator \( cinnamon \) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett in a game of wish fulfillment one upmanship even though she s calling the shots as it s her book scarlett still comes out miles ahead perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism even if misplaced just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies such as ivanhoe presents the story may have been one sided but it s the side mm chose to tell and there s kernel of truth in the myth of the old south as in all myths margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so called parody which is really a subconscious or not so subconscious in fact effort to knock from her pedestal that epitome of heroines katie scarlett o hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought he was obsessed with scarlett that s why he turned to women like belle watling and to imagine mammy killing the male babies when she had been devoted to ellen o hara from ellen s childhood thank goodness this book isn t a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw because what it is a a travesty and not even a well written or engaging one at that gwtw will still be read and loved for all time like the classic it is when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales i didn t even pay that thank goodness the woman gave it to me and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash i d give it a negative star if there was such a rating ludicrous and laughable try again ms randall and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co again margaret mitchell need not fear lol,negative

having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series the following are my suggestions 1 read all five books in order the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3 500 page experience 2 read the oxford university editions there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events when you read 3 500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter 3 if you really like any one book in particular go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable along with sir walter scott alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel i have been reading these types of novels my entire life beyond a doubt alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre,positive
janet browne s far reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th century s most controversial biologist geologist the first volume of a two volume set voyaging begins \( as you would expect \) with his youth in the english town of shrewsbury under his father s care we meet his father a doctor and businessman his brother intelligent but unfocused and his late grandfather erasmus darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views from his early days browne depicts a darwin struggling to find himself first as a medical student in edinburgh then as a student of theology in cambridge though we know better what darwin is to be browne s portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options but the story often returns to darwin s love of the outdoors and of biology a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis steps at life he is seen as a frequent hunter and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles despite this and despite the benefit of hindsight at times i felt some tension finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for we finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard the beagle a vessel bound for south america on a surveying mission i won t spoil the rest other than to say that browne does an excellent job of building darwin showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature and yet even then darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed victorian society in tenor it s clear that browne a professor in the history of biology greatly respects her subject but she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station and held certain prejudices that the author doesn t hesitate to point out such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery she also reveals what some may find darwin s less endearing traits such as his anti social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science \( when approaching the subject of marriage darwin s priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who he feared might place demands on his time \) she does seem to soft pedal darwin s poor treatment of his companions on the beagle many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized \( for those curious this theme is well explored in robert wright s the moral animal \) also it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him more my failing than the author s i think as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on darwin s life if you do decide to read it it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes \( although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book \) certainly the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution \( and the legend of charles darwin \) was born i ve read few biographies better,positive
i m sure most people will come to fitzgerald through her novels so i have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories i still haven t decided if i enjoyed the collection but they are unique i thought the first story was by far the best but after that the quality varied widely unlike a classic short story writer \( someone like guy de mauppassant \) these stories have no resolution for the most part in fact they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the major key discordant is the word i m looking for the settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries i suspect most would enjoy her novels more \( i am certainly heading in that direction to read them next \) but i can t say since i haven t read them myself overall i found this collection a bit unsettling but still well written i m sure her fans will enjoy them more than i did on this first encounter,positive
i couldn t read the whole thing in order to know for sure it was dry i didn t get the imagery i know it s supposed to be a classic and i really wanted to read the book i did but it was long and boring and i just don t get why it s so classicly popular sorry but it s how i feel now that being said i read a condensed version of it and i discovered the story was a little bit interesting but that s as far as i can go even with the condensed version it was only a little bit interesting,negative
the title of this book is rather deceptive in that you certainly don t need to be adventurous or daring to find this book helpful i do sedate landscapes and found his book an excellent guide basically if you do the least bit of original design in your work altering an element or two changing colors around or if you do whole original works \( but haven t actually gone to art school \) this book is extremely useful it covers the basics of design and color with a focus on the embroiderer or fiber artist you can do all the suggested activities in the book in order as a complete design course or pick and choose sections as needed if you wonder why some of your works look great and others look well not as great this book is for you,positive
i echo the comments of the previous reviewers don t waste your money not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual u2 fan it can t even get those facts right the book states that bono s father dropped the family off at a catholic church before driving himself to another church this contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that bob hewson was catholic while bono his mother and brother were protestant in the same paragraph the dublin neighborhood of glasnevin is misspelled asnevin the hearing aid shop from which bono took his name is misspelled and perhaps most galling of all the author can t even get the full name of larry mullen jr right and this is just chapter one i have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing i would suggest skipping this one and purchasing bono in conversation with michka assayas which includes a pretty good account of bono s life from the man himself,negative

don t get me wrong i really enjoy neal stephenson s books the historical content he winds into his plots is engaging however i have been working with the micro computer since before the command line neal you have the title wrong in the beginning was the monitor no doubts in my mind my right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed the command line came much later more like the coalescence of matter in the universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity the monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches address load and register load momentary switches the monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all so 2 stars because the title is just wrong,negative
for a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment this book was a pleasure to read the concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation however i specifically enjoyed how steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports from establishing values to finalizing the contract this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process also at the end of each sub chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading winning with integrity isn t easy in general let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book,positive
this collection of poems tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson s works is in final assessment a crime against the poet s great talent as is freely admitted in the introduction the editor mr higginson worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter changing the line arrangements and rewriting the dialect of the local area this is a free admission of the book s guilt having adulterated dickenson s original poems in both content and form gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems meanings and worst of all gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist as thomas h johnson says in the introduction to the complete poems of emily dickenson a representative mid nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman which he was not equipped to estimate do yourself a favor and avoid this text instead find one that is true to the original poems one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson,negative
if you re looking for a good story with plenty of action and a great plot and you re not really concerned with the difference between so so writing and good writing \( this book is so so \) then this is an excellent book i couldnt put it down i gauge the rating of a book by one thing am i able to truely come into the story i am able to do this if the writing and word usage is at or above a certain level i was able to come into the story when i read this book and to me that provides for a good read bad writing can prevent this experience but i didn t think this book was too badly written,positive
despite early promise marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self reflection this effort fails to deliver on the author s experience and acumen the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of united states rhetoric and policies on africa i had hoped for more given the fine record in newsprint of this well traveled journalist,negative

when i was 21 and in my first year of graduate school paul fussell s poetic meter and poetic form was one of the first text books assigned to me when i bought the book and saw how slim it was i snickered grad school s gonna be a walk in the park yeah right this densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading on and off over the last 20 years i have come back to this book to refresh my memory and usually to astonish myself the book s real strength besides professor fussell s obvious command of his subject and his ability to convey that command is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry even at this late date in my life i can t pretend to understand the entire book but what i do understand i admire and respect poetic meter and poetic form is not recommended to anyone studying poetry it is urgently required,positive
i m not a huge fan of this genre of music but as a very part time musician this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician i liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining even if the subject matter was not of immense interest this is definitely not the fault of the author who did a fine job of making this subject engaging thus i found the read illuminating to no small degree i learned alot about the roots of punk how it spread and rose and the end of it by correctly defining the terms of the book the indie years we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years once they sign with a major label their story is ended this was both a good idea and frustrating one as we see the birth and growth of bands but not what happens to them \( in most cases \) once they hit a major label frequently signing with a major label creates expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and i would have liked to have known what happened from there regardless this book is well written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book,positive
an excellent short introduction to the philosophy of logical atomism the lectures should be read along with wittgenstein s tractatus logico philosophicus russell s logical atomism differs significantly from wittgenstein s version of the theory but both share certain key features which make the theory distinctive those who enjoy mathematical philosophy will not be disappointed,positive
im not sure where to begin with this review its not that the book was poorly written quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal it was quite infact extremely boring by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series they were all very good from front to back there is way way to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again im giving this book 2 out of 5 very poor story line poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did blown away rather than tired and exhausted,negative

as a student of urban development and politics i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that by employing simply economic analysis does not allow for the intricacies of the city s problems class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel,negative

firstly let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature his data sources are vast and highly informative the major limitation of this publication is that the central argument is biased lardy selects those data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view as a result major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over lardy s view is the typical western dare i say american argument primarily he uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china s state banks this methodoloy is extremely poor particularly in the context of china s trannsitional economy financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency if anyone would like elaboration on this point feel free to email me in summary lardy s book is informative and makes for interesting reading however as a piece of economic analysis its usefulness is limited the major reason for this is a total lack of economic theory \( as indicated by the previous reviewer \) which has resulted in a poor methodology,negative
i had to take a look at this book just like i did rachel shteir s previous book striptease to see if the online reviews were true sadly they were like striptease this book was full of typo s and appeared poorly organized and written one would think that ms shteir would have learned from her previous book which also had similarly poor reviews i wonder why gypsy rose lee paired up with her i can only guess at ms shteir s fascination with this topic my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself \( or maybe she is \) i base this in part on a meeting with ms shteir a year ago when i invited her to write about a professional conference i organized and presented at she wore a very low cut blouse as she interviewed people i m no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me on top of that her article was chock full of misquotes errors in fact and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to oh well i can only hope that ms shteir s next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter gypsy rose i guess we both made the same mistake trusting someone like ms shteit to help us tell a story who didn t have the heart or the skills to pull it off,negative
i bought this recording with high hopes what better complement to reading shakespeare than hearing him right well not with this recording the cast is made up of distinguished actors the insert proclaims but it s obvious that these actors haven t done shakespeare since they were in junior high school nor have they improved since then none of the actors has any feel for the shakespearean line the speaking is stiff and mechanical and half the time it sounds like a monty python farce when there are no visual effects to distract us low quality acting really sticks out for audio recordings you need the best voices too bad arkangel didn t realize this my advice grind up these cds and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums,negative
the best out of three guide books i looked at and a must for the first trip to the big island,negative
i am so sorry that i bought this book it is unfortunate that you do not have a penguin or everyman s library edition first of all the book is too large to read in bed secondly whoever did the proofreading should be fired there are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading if the postage were not so expensive from israel i would return the book to amazon,negative
i purchased this book at walmart which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology it was cheap and on the clearance rack i should have know better when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one after borrowing and reading the first two i realized what a sham this series truly is first i realize they are supposed to be fictional however when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate additionally when usurping a mythical name such as shambala one should know what the actual mythology entails instead of making up one s own notion of what is involed shambala is not the same as shangri la shangri la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield s imagination also beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures but they must never be mixed together it just doesn t work,negative
