george sluizer s original dutch french version of the vanishing \( aka the man who wanted to know \) offers one of european cinema s most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you ve seen that version you probably still can t get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its lady vanishes plot \( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive \) and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that no one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from dok tah e ville no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they don t even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they re given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the high low mood shifts in the couple s relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he s probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame let s end on a joke like a tv cop show moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score can t do anything for this one,negative
a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and can t cook and doesn t have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about \( she writes a very popular domestic advice column \) she succeeds until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby problem is she doesn t have any of those things she borrows the house \( from a man who wants to marry her \) she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house and she even borrows a baby the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it s really a girl then the mother of the baby takes it back and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one then the woman is falling in love with the navy man \( and he with her \) while the man from whom she s borrowed the house still believes she s going to marry him and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding it s a delightful movie very funny and rich in both plot and character development unfortunately what probably makes it not a classic by today s standards it is a bit plodding it does not move at the same pace as for example the movie casablanca with which it shares some of the same supporting actors,negative

saw this on the box last night i sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve it didn t i kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film the dialogue is wooden the plot is pathetic the whole set up is unconvincing it looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole vegas craze which ranges from csi to the cooler \( incidentally the cooler is another one to avoid \) i would give this zero stars if i could,negative
i look at the average raiting for this movie stars now thats supposed to mean its ok well ppl this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves i read some review saying the musicwas good and well from my perspective it seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment and i would almost barely knotice if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense it was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here save your money i bought this after seeing the first which was lame but i though it was ok and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something well this was in 6th grade huge mistake i hated it when i first saw it it seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it and about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play good considering its live but lame as far as movies get oh and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing i really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made but that was untill i saw reptillian which is kinda depressingly awfull,negative
a terrific documentary even if you have seen it on pbs you need the dvd to view the great extra material,positive
i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by living in oblivion the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener one of our most overlooked and under appreciated hollywood actresses she once again did not disappoint but the entire cast was extremely good you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason i m glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem,positive
as some of the other reviewers have mentioned this us release has replaced the original source music but the region 2 version has been released without these cuts so for everyone with a multiregion player i d suggest using amazon co uk to buy a copy there instead,negative
one of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again maybe i m hoping the movie will get better with time unfortunately judge dredd does not i m a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre cgi an action hero star a comic relief and a beautiful love interest but please don t mess with the storyline maybe thiis is the case for future shock and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person s humanity and dredd forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary in fact i feel two stars is gviing this movie too much,negative
a pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family you can count on me tells the story of sammy \( laura linney \) and terry prescott \( mark ruffalo \) siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young years later and sammy is a single mother of 8 year old rudy \( rory culkin \) she works hard at her job at the bank now run by over critical brain everett \( matthew broderick \) and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is \( josh lucas has a great cameo as rudy senior \) when terry shows up after months of no communication sammy is immediately thrilled but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw up and is just using her again terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend s abortion but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with sammy and rudy over the course of a few weeks terry has made a deep impact especially in the life of young rudy who idolizes him this film follows the changes each of these siblings make changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make it s a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it shouldn t be missed the performances by the two leads are outstanding and young rory culkin is adorable and mature as sammy s son but the real shock to me was matthew broderick who played the demanding philandering unlikable type brilliantly and he s not one i m generally impressed with,positive
ils se mari rent et eurent beaucoup d enfants \( happily ever after \) is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love lust marriage infidelity and the single life writer director actor yvan attal has come up with a winner an entertaining funny and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering three men work together in a car dealership vincent \( yvan attal \) is the apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife gabrielle \( charlotte gainsbourg \) and child georges \( alain chabat \) on the other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with nathalie \( emmanuelle seigner \) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and negatively influence their child fred \( alain cohen \) is single bedding every lovely woman he encounters balancing trysts between mornings afternoons and evenings and is deeply envied for his don juanism but fred actually longs for the sense of belonging that married men enjoy the men s lives intertwine on many levels most important we discover that vincent has a lover \( angie david \) despite his idyllic married life and while it is georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover he remains faithful to his nagging wife gabrielle senses vincent s affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop \( johnny depp \) who begins to preoccupy her thoughts she is a real estate broker and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains faithful all the while she daydreams about her brief encounter with depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily decides to leap into the married fray the only adults sharing advice here are vincent s long married parents \( anouk aim e and claude berri in very welcome comeback cameos \) and it is this standard that adds the final humor to the film the manner in which all three men deal with their living situations asks as many questions as it gives answers attal finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what provides them happiness this is a smart movie with terrific twists there is just enough slapstick \( an all out food fight between vincent and gabrielle real life husband and wife team attal and gainsbourg that proves to be one of the fun loving bits of silliness that binds their marriage \) to keep the mood light not a profound film but a joyous french comedy handled by total pros in french and english with subtitles recommended grady harp october 0,positive

i can t wait to see the original film again i remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea thus was born the inspiration for the great pc game lemmings yes i know that the lemmings were manipulated into suicide nevertheless i love this movie i hope that they don t cut the lemming sequence disney has promised a full restoration other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an arctic blizzard the hardships of an arctic existence were beautifully photographed,positive
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity s two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he s awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then,negative
they don t make films like this today it s a scathing smart funny and thought provoking look at tv news but more importantly it s a great film about complicated people and their relationships,positive

what a mind numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror comedy of all time the re animator continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re animator series for his own and to convince us that he can direct producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite beyond re animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna directed bride of re animator that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story as with dagon yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film unfortunately the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast this is a story set in massachusetts for crying out loud why would the warden of the prison the reporter coming to cover the story the guards and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents it wouldn t be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act but they can t simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast but their acting is so bad and their adr afflicted lines so glaringly off that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes \( witness the gratuitous nurse nipple scene in this film or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re animator \) and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry based on yuzna s shoddy history with actors one might be tempted to blame it on the director but the fact is that in this film jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment basic elementary acting his every internal and external beat rings false his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre most high school students do better than this jeffrey combs as herbert west seasoned pro that he is gamely plays along but the script puts west s character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit inducing pataky andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film on a strictly technical level the cinematography looks good the score is all right \( though often too serious minded for its own good \) and the film doesn t look low budget but when the story is such a mess and the actors so inept no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film yuzna really should stick with producing because on the stuart gordon directed dagon at least there were some good moments but beyond re animator is beyond salvaging possibly the worst film sequel i ve ever seen and way up there in the list of worst films i ve ever subjected myself to,negative
i actually didn t mind kiss the girls because of morgan freeman he saved the day in that movie plus i m always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos that always peaks my interest but ashley judd s performance was just terrible in that \( not that i think she s very good in anything i ve seen but whatever \) that s why i was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with morgan freeman still playing alex cross but thankfully without ashely judd \( a better name for her would be ashely dudd but that s my opinion \) along came a spider was not only an interesting storyline it was also very well acted there s some twists of course which i won t spoil but one i did see coming and the other blindsided me all in all very enjoyable especially for the low price i found this at the little girl who is kidnapped in this played by mika boorem is terrific it was kind of neat seeing her in this as i had just watched the movie sleepover recently \( also reviewed it cute little movie check it out \) where she s more grown up hopefully we ll be seeing more things with her anyway i found this engrossing enough and most times you can t go wrong with morgan freeman \( except if ashely judd is in a scene with him but that s not his fault \) as he s an exceptional actor obsessed with serial killers psychos and the like just as i am then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of along came a spider,positive

so why give justice league the full 5 stars because it appeals to every generation in my family i bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with superheros as we hung out together watching the shows i was as engrossed in the story as my son then i noticed that my wife was intrigued and so were the grandparents the characters and plots are very well developed for a cartoon so it is more like watching a dramatic series watching the series allows you to pick up on sub plots too like the attraction between batman and wonderwoman jean jone s struggle to find a place as the last of his people and the entire groups struggle to work together as a cohesive team another excellent buy to consider would be the spiderman the new animated series,positive
the military courtroom drama a few good men is one of those films that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it s own but even with countless viewings it retains it s emotional power and speaks to us about issues that have become more important than ever in the film we meet lt daniel kaffee \( tom cruise \) a young successful military lawyer who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases that supposably he s never even seen the inside of a courtroom he is assigned the cases of pfc louden downey \( james marshall \) and lance cpl harold dawson \( wolgang bodison \) they are accused of murder and a host of other charges when at the guantanamo bay military base they performed a code red \( an illegal form of discipline within a military unit \) on pvt william sandiago which unintentionally resulted in his death while the two accused marines admit they did the code red both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors which includes base commander col nathan jessup \( a brillaint jack nicholson \) a powerful highly decorated officer who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command with both time running out and a lack of legal evidence kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy through a brilliant script \( based on the play by aaron sorkin \) rob reiner s steady direction and the cast s dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as code honor discipline should a soldier always follow orders no matter what whats more important our ethics principles \( on which this country was founded \) or our need for security is col jessup right can we not handle the truth it s hard to believe that this film was made way back in 1992 in this post 9 11 post abu grebbe world where our country is on a war footing the questions that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever the film is filled with great performances while i am not normally a huge tom cruise fan i have to admit that cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer the same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from demi moore kevin bacon and kiefer sutherland but what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant dynamic performance that comes from jack nicholson when cruise puts nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on you just watch in awe as nicholson just continually builds the character s palpable anger until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous you can t handle the truth speech even though the speech and nicholson s performance has been endlessly quoated parodied when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance if you are interested in seeing a well made movie courtroom drama that is both thought provoking and entertaining then i highly recommend a few good men,positive
if there s a worse movie than this i haven t seen it looks like it was made in a day the quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits sort of like it was copied from a vhs tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6 000 times the actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad twilight zone episode if you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes the musical performances are obscure little known doo wop flops \( except for frankie lymon \) look i wasted 14 99 plus tax plus gas to run out and buy this bomb the only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in swedish send it to a greenwich village art house and pass it off as a foreign film come to think of it don t bother to dub it the sound is so off it looks dubbed already important update please read this i later discovered after i wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50 s i understand that it is used constantly at the international institute for sleep disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi comcious near sleep state for incurable insomniacs and so as i write this update i ve been watching the flick again and i must admit i \( yawn \) oh excuse me where was i oh yes i must admit that i \( bigger yawn \) oh my goodness i m so sorry this is so rude of me \( yawn \) but it seems like \( snoring \) i \( snoring \) i just can t seem to \( intense snoring \),negative
this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it s a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one,positive

this is one of the great biopic films ever made more often than not film biopics are too rushed they try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives this is not one of those films it just covers woody guthrie s adult life from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer and his passionate defense of the working man the look of the film is deliberate in that it s washed out the hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film they re really lively where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves the film has a real genuine feel to it like you re actually watching real people david carradine is amazing as woody guthrie he makes you think you re actually watching woody himself he did his own singing and stuntwork on the film ronny cox is excellent as well and he does his own singing too \( remember cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in deliverance \) randy quaid and melinda dillon offer great supporting roles as well this is a fabulous film and it feels short at 2 1 2 hours,positive

i had the distinct pleasure of seeing richard jeni live a few years ago and i gotta tell you that i really almost peed my pants he was astoundingly funny this dvd definitely captures his comic genius although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed it was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which from what i heard was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get which is itself really sad he developed what i think is the best comedy which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are ultimately pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world he will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do and by doing so how we should and can be a lot better than we are,positive

this is an imaginative take on the jack and the beanstalk story while it was apparently made for kids the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested \( i m 19 \) plus as a female i appreciate the fact that it s one of the few stories where \( possible spoiler \) the damsel \( who s in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women \) rescues prince charming well acted it features some great chemistry between sara and modine but i still can t give it 5 stars here s why \( spoilers ahead \) 1 i m no math person but why couldn t the writers be consistent with when jack s dad died one minute they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when jack was 14 since jack is 37 it shows that the writers can t do simple addition couldn t they just take two seconds to do the math 2 how the hell does siggy know about goose and harp i got the impression from wilhemina that jack s dad didn t believe the story of the original jack but apparently jack s dad told siggy not to tell him about the family s dark secret until he was ready i wish there was a more believable explanation for siggy knowing a lot more than he should 3 if siggy is smart enough to know the all the robinson secrets i think he should be able to catch on to the fact that jack is in love with ondine fairly quickly i always wondered why he didn t try to kill ondine when he was so against jack having an heir i understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones don t get me wrong i don t want ondine to die i wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and jack but shooting her \( or at least threatening her \) would have been a great way to kick up the tension suspense 4 siggy s accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that completely fell flat it was not funny and was a bit gratuitous but if you re a fan of romance adventure or just feel good movies in general those things shouldn t keep you from enjoying this film don t think too much about the plot holes you ll go insane if you do,positive
i loved the artistic topics of art music in this particular little people dvd and i have to say this is one of our favorites but i do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each dvd if you have other lp movies then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there i also agree that the menu setup could be better with all 10 episodes playing back to back rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are otherwise this is still a great dvd much better than the lp storytime collection,positive
as i stated before i have a fabulous thing called digital cable one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off sometimes that happens with digital cable but it usually it will right itself in the end as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore i tried everything to fix it including switching channels turning on and off the tv and things of that nature i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining but even that was a wasted effort i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs width away from haymakering morris well even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this because it might not be completely his fault for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices or it might be because it s his first movie who knows but howard s mind was made up rumble in the bronx was to be rented from what i saw so far on digital cable i possibly found a person i could call my mentor when i enter the world of stuntmen when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what the dvd was messed up as well the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on digital cable i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy telling them this dvd was broken i returned home again and tried to watch it what the heck i yelled is the world against howard tuttleman you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window \( i rented it on my father s card so there is no recourse to me \) after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica i was still determined to see this movie i ran up to best buy in troy and i found a copy i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version hoping that it was a new pressing i was happy with his answer and purchased it well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights finally tuttleman will have his moment well to keep this clean and short let me say that that night ended with a baseball bat three \( 3 \) stitches in my hand a broken window and a hefty grounding sentence \( we are talking weeks here \) in conclusion some movies can t be good no matter how cool the stuntman this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot later,negative
what is it with the british film scene and its distinctly gritty style it seems that if we re not producing trashy ealing comedies it s a shocking reality drama with the likes of ray winstone in it well ray winstone isn t in this one but he could well be as the rat catcher is another one of those you either enjoy challenging films or you don t pieces i personally love them i guess i must be a miserable bugger of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate but it is unique \( well probably not unique \) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy played by william eadie who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him we learn that no matter what environment children grow up in they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow without wishing to give too much away it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since i watched it in 2000 worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things,positive

i ve seen several pretty funny comedies this year but none of them could touch what i watched saturday night this dvd had it all slapstick funny costumes hilarious sight gags geeky dancing and more there were times i was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt i just couldn t stop laughing and in fact spent most of the show with tears rolling down my cheeks it was so funny that i felt at a couple of points i was going to lose control of my bowels yes it s that funny i highly recommend this one as it s the closest thing i ve seen to the classic monty python days of english humor i don t know when i saw a movie that was non stop hilarity without a single moment of serious content over two hours of complete madcap behaviour and a near fatal dose of cheese the name of the dvd castles dreams by an english comedy troupe called blackmore s night these guys are like a combination of monty python benny hill and marty feldman my sides are still aching those crazy f king brits,negative
my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school it wasn t until years later that i saw it and i was horrified this was a movie aimed at children what does a children s movie need a sexy bunny for the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and strutting her stuff on the basketball court in a very provocative manner until the male characters were panting drooling and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick depraved perverts this scene was highly innapropriate for children and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls not only that the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities this movie should be kept far far away from children and was truly deserving of zero stars,negative

i think be my valentine charlie brown was fine the only sad things were when charlie brown didn t get any valentines until a day later and when linus missed giving valentine treats to his teacher i would have felt the same way as violet when charlie brown wasn t getting valentines i would say charlie brown should have gotten as many valentines as the others everybody is too mean to him a charlie brown valentine was swell because it wasn t as sad on this one charlie brown seems to go after the little red haired girl through most of it he wanted to dance with her but couldn t what sounded odd to me was that peppermint patty sent him a valentine this time it would only sound like her if she really loved charlie brown,positive

this is an amazing dvd i read reviews online all the time saying anyone will like this but seriously i even showed it to my mother who laughed that s a big deal this dvd follows these four comedians on their two week tour their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city also throughout the episodes it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in america during her time of need interpersonal relationships and anything else they could think of this dvd makes me laugh to tears every time literally,positive
melanie griffith rachel leigh cook and hugh dancy star in this straight to video film about one female transporter who gets into trouble because of someone plotting against her well that s all about it apparently but the film tries to give something unique to the otherwise unoriginal plot i mean the slightly original character of sarah by melanie griffth who plays that smuggler in trouble given a special job by malcom mcdowell with his customary i could be very baaaad smile sarah agrees to carry a pack hidden in her bag but as you know someone also wants that package and well that s nothing new but she is attacked on the way don t expect any thriller however the film s focus is not about that it is the relations about sarah and jack \( dancy \) who live together in a fancy paris apartment but while sarah is away from paris on business jack is attracted to a younger lady jenny \( cook \) who also falls for him thus the film makes an effort to include both love and crime nice try considering this interesting point about the character of elder lady sarah but if the factor is taken away from the film the end result is nothing but a flat tired suspence suspence as to its relations and its crimes alike either way the film is emotilnally very void ok two fatally bad things one too incredible characters see sarah is a professional courier who must know the rules of the job which could be dangerous but instead of renting a car \( and it s europe where that could be pretty easy \) she takes a train \( and a night train \) in which she becomes an easy target in this way the film misses every chance to make it more suspenceful when some character \( s \) must die they die like characters in old video games they fall that s all the other one acting let me be honest it was painful to watch the one dimentional performance of melanie griffith who was very good in another day in paradise maybe she is not the greatest actor but certainly she can act but as far as tempo is concerned no i don t think so only the location of paris saves this film from utter forgettableness forget about this one,negative
i really tried to come to this movie with and open mind i m a huge fan of jane austen and i thought the 1995 bbc miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel still i was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story jane austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst this film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of austen s humor for example an unmarried man and woman would never greet each other in their pajamas a man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown when these rules of propriety are ignored by the film how are we supposed to understand or believe that it s a big deal when lydia runs away with wickham another example is lady catherine this is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions yet in this film we see her barge into the bennet household in the middle of the night and wake lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning \( when lady catherine wouldn t have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark no streetlights remember to the bennet household \) because no one adhere s to societies rigorous and for the most part arbitrary rules the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things another weakness lies in the casting granted these actors had big shoes to fill colin firth and jennifer ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries but as i said there are other ways to interpret and play the characters unforunately here everyone seems as if they re reading lines with dramatic inflection not acting you can almost imagine keira knightly s script having notes saying insert spunkiness here while the scenery is lovely the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a bronte adaptation more than a manacured austen setting overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity,negative
this is an adorable movie it s low budget and the acting is not spectacular but nevertheless it s a cute story with sexy characters and an impressive unique plot conrad is a successful attractive man recently heart broken venturing into the unknown he hires a sex worker for the night as it turns out his hired man ian is quite the catch a young charming sexy australian trying to save money to stay in the country soon enough ian is in conrad s life every day though not as you may think as ian moves into conrad s social life everyone s issues come to the surface love stories unfold and redevelop problems at home collide with life at work the truth behind ian s need to do sex work comes out and everyone is in for a wake up call about life and what they need basically it s genuine it s cute and charming and it deals with real life problems most of which just happen to be gay a definite plus in my book so give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film well worth seeing,positive
the only good thing in this movie was ms howard s performance she is innocent and believable i can t understand how good actors like weaver hurt and phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this the plain dialogue among the elders is painfully numbing choppy and stilted and the directing drove me crazy especially since m night insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through or following them without ever bothering with close ups these scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera if you like the back of william hurt s head you ll get plenty of it in this film the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague which is too bad since when he finally has a good speech we are deprived of the anger i imagine was in his eyes i agree with others i would have worked better as a 30 minute twilight zone episode rent it first before you buy and save some money for a classic thriller like psycho,negative
this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the lonesome dove the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering small talking yammering blah blah blah from the first second to the last minute just like mcmurty s novels all the characters were just kept talking talking talking in meaningless small talks almost talked your ears off it s so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in lonesome dove gus talked and talked but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic dead man s walk and the comanchi moon the more logic one is the real sequel the street of loredo at least gus was dead and call remained not just silent but more quiet by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book scripted by the author the whole movie was doomed to be horrible because mcmurty simply couldn t omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel page after page blah blah blah and we have to find the storyline among those conversations dialogs and dug them out of those garbage like paragraphs watching this movie was no different those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut blabbering day and night even during the comanchi attacks what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in lonesome dove because from the very beginning everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens drive me nuts how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the lonesome dove once a moron a coward an idiot always would be a one no matter how old you have become adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron coward or an idiot how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me at least the lonesome dove movie adaptation was close to what the novel read like and the street of loredo movie was also an adaptations from the novel,negative
this effort shows it s age in addition there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo scientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele i suppose it s possible for it to be taken as tongue in cheek by those at the post graduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology however i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing,negative
born in steventon hampshire in 1775 jane austen was one of two daughters of the reverent george austen and his wife cassandra she was educated in oxford and in southampton finally attending a boarding school in the abbey gatehouse in reading berkshire the environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth jane austen s works are imaginative full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time jane austen wrote about society about propriety and about etiquette she was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters jane austen wrote pride and prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world the first time i read this book i read as a child back in cuba orgullo y prejuicio the writings of jane austen shaped my perception of true love as i identified with the love between elizabeth bennet and her one and only mr darcy with this bbc adaptation completed in 1996 i have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic one of the best books ever written with this bbc miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book for the adaptation faithfully follows the author s writing the filming is magnificent offering us a view of gorgeous scenery magnificent castles and locations that bring the book to life for we can see what we expected after reading the book the love story presents the struggle of the times as two individuals fall in love regardless of class differences or status and yet the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences darcy is a wealthy single man who upon meeting the family of elizabeth boisterous non polished and simple believes her to be beneath him the meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with elizabeth sister but darcy thinks he knows jane s heart not to be true to these emotions elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant darcy keeping her distance and yet without her awareness falling in love with him jane austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of elizabeth family make the wrong choices the dialogue is almost verbatim to the book making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work jennifer ehle as elizabeth and colin firth as darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives as with most dvds that we own we watch by selecting english subtitles which enhances the viewing by allowing us not to miss a single word said by the characters who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the english language there is a documentary as an additional bonus where interviews with cast members are included simply awesome interviewed are jennifer ehle elizabeth colin firth darcy we also get to see those who played mary bennet lucy briers mr collins david bamber mr bingley crispin bonham carter and mr wickham adrian lukis,positive

i m not sure why i never watched ghost before until last night for some reason i didn t pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on tv i m glad i gave it a chance because this is a good movie what makes it good is its skillful mixture of suspense romance comedy and the supernatural that would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance i was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where i couldn t wait to see what was coming next there were a few convenient capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work i m a rather pragmatic person but by the time these things came up i was so caught up in the story that i wanted these things to be possible obviously the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well i wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching ghost i was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with whoopie goldberg so i want to confess that i thought her best supporting actress oscar was well deserved i figure that i was one of the last persons in america to see ghost but if there are others of you out there who still haven t seen it give it a look it s well worth it,positive

perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln s various works such as the sacred place the messianic legacy and holy blood holy grail or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books however it is simply not successful as a stand alone video or as a video about the da vinci code the narrator mr lincoln takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the languedoc home to the cathar heresy and the albigensian crusade and points out some interesting details in his wandering yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture as well he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals \( many inspired it would seem by lincoln s books \) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions i finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark i cannot imagine what else mr lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour,negative

small town america only this isn t the pleasant and white picketed small town america of film noir fame it s the gray and colorless small town america of neo noir and there s the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it a bum who s being approached by that famous man in a black trenchcoat hard eight \( aka sydney but i ve yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title \) is a debut pretty much as promising as blood simple to the brothers coen paul thomas anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want \( or expect \) them to do but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout anderson also uses neo noir color to great effect allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir that said anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies and despite the long takes and steady cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies he focuses most of his time on the characters faces and just lets them be if he hadn t already done the amazing and always stunning later work of magnolia boogie nights and punch drunk love i d say that this is a promising debut that makes me impatient for the next anderson picture to come out but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt i must say see this to see anderson at his roots and man i can t wait for his next feature polarisdi,positive
this thoughtfully prepared collection of 3 buster keaton movies 2 shorts from early and late in his pre feature period and the feature seven chances show a wide range of comedy styles from slapstick to more refined visual humor to what we would today call situation comedy where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters the earliest in the collection neighbors from 1920 is in some way the most satisfying of the set although keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with fatty arbuckle the backyard love affair for example that opens the film resembles arbuckle s 1915 classic fatty s plucky pup in neighbors there is more story revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents and the eventual need for the couple to elope there is sweetness youthful energy and innocence in the entire movie as well as great acrobatics including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men the balloonatic \( 1923 \) near the end of the period in which buster was making short films is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film there is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props and this film is full of them still for once keaton seems uninspired perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story the feature in the set seven chances from 1925 is based on a single theme buster the rich boy down on his luck must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million dollars this absurd premise induces for much of the film a hal roach like situation comedy rather than the visual acrobatic style that is more associated with keaton as buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers the variety of embarrassing rejections that buster must endure has funny moments but may not satisfy all of buster s fans the climax however returns us to tried and true keaton formula the lone man being chased by a thundering herd in this case of angry women in full wedding apparel fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by buster s colleague unbeknownst to buster the chase has satisfying moments including buster dodging large bolders although worth seeing the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature the result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with keaton s genius,positive

no spoilers we had enough of lame japanese films this new wave of horror movies like the ring pulse and now the grudge 2 doesn t seem to have an end the genre is played out but that didn t stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow up of the decent 2004 first version to understand this film which is nearly impossible until the end you would have to see the first movie brief story the film has basically three plots but in a way they are connected to each other the first plot is a follow up of what happened to karen davis \( sara michele gellar \) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house mrs davis \( joanna cassidy \) asks her other daughter aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister karen she travels to japan to bring sara home now in japan she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house but something terrible is about to happen the second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house one of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don t know about suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child she tries to get out but the door jammed they all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost unfortunately they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited the third plot takes place in the us where a new family moves to an old building a young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the strange lady that lives next door has something to do with it people are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence review less scary and sillier than the original the grudge 2 takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience the movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them we have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other this time around the ghosts are outsourcing from japan to the us they don t care whether you visit the house or not now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason these ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way even a young little boy just to show their rage the so called scary moments are not scary at all they are lame mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version what s sad is that this time around the writers have to make the actresses show some skin to please the male teen audience this is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie in the technical department the movie doesn t do a good job either the editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion we have three plots that are poorly mixed together sometimes we are in japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the us the photography of the film is identical to its predecessor but that s the only thing that resemblances the original in the sound department the movie will make you laugh we hear sillier noises than the original instead of getting scared you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make we personally like the angry kitty sound the verdict a terrible sequel of a decent horror film the grudge 2 could have been a straight to video release if it wasn t for the beautiful sara michelle gellar no scary moments but many funny ones unintentionally of course,negative
this dvd teaches the history of tai chi and the history of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form it explains that these two tai chi forms were originally a martial art style and that now they are usually done for health improvement then it shows the 24 posture form from the front and the back and with breathing instructions im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements but when i am this is a great guide it then shows each of the 24 postures and their original martial art applications which helps you have a strong intent during the posture and keeps your arms and legs in proper position then it teaches the 24 posture form step by step with very detailed instruction this is a much more expanded version of this video by master liang than the original vhs the dvd also shows the 48 posture form which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form and has other movements from other styles it has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average it has also improved my confidence and people keep saying i have a glow about me i just feel healthier and happier too this dvd is easy to learn from quickly the chinese bamboo flute music is nice oh actually my favorite part is at the end it shows a slideshow of photos of the master doing each posture move by move with great music i like to do my form along to this section because it is a bit slower than the actual form and you can exactly match your movements to the master its like having a one on one class with him i find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly i remember the form now without having to think so i can try to turn my attention inward a great dvd,positive
director denzel washington cast denzel washington derek luke joy bryant salli richardson malcolm david kelley cody hodges leonard earl howze novella nelson running time 120 minutes rated pg 13 for violence language and mature thematic material involving child abuse based on a true story and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from his own book antwone fisher is at heart a study of psychological disturbance laced with reasonable amounts of hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit it s a peculiarly american medicine swallowed less willingly in some markets than others which probably explains why criticism of the film often confused denzel washington s directorial talents \( which are generally good \) with the various workings of his film s plot which can be argued about antwone fisher s story starts in the navy where after a particularly vivid nightmare he slugs a fellow shipmate and is hauled up before the captain sent to navy psychiatrist jerome davenport \( washington \) he begins to work out issues of anger that it turns out stem from an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead friend at the same time fisher \( played exceptionally well by newcomer derek luke \) struggles to establish a first adult romantic relationship with the inviting cheryl \( joy bryant \) in a parallel plot thread washington s character the ever reasonable dr davenport is having marital problems in due course we discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and fisher is a catalyst for his own change fisher s screenplay reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route after his stint in the navy and with little writing experience he was hired by a sony executive to write his own story a process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was acceptable most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to the uncertainties he brings to his new craft although washington s direction papers reasonably well over many cracks the most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve around the main character these include the psychiatrist s ironic domestic problems as well as fisher s tentative love life one is tempted to see these narrative distractions as rather manipulative bolt on elements leavening the appeal of a central harrowing personal history the fisher cheryl romance for instance while in context necessarily clumsy is also ultimately gauche and once consummated it is left to languish without further comment as if further exploration of this side to fisher s maturing was unnecessary perhaps sensing this central weakness fisher s script introduces another element into the young african american s tortured life as a foster child during flashbacks he has to deal with slave nation justifications from mrs tate \( novella nelson \) suggesting a link between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done to the whole black race a reasoning which is frankly unconvincing and none too interesting significantly such issues are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself and soon disappear from view on the plus side is the central performance by derek luke as the hero a perfectly judged acting job that neatly balances inner rage and confusion i don t know what to do with lack of self pity washington s role is also well done given the difficulty of the actor director role he is to be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without fuss either in front or behind the camera this is washington s directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a thorough picture of antwone and even though the film could have benefited from some tighter editing it s still a film that delivers all the emotional goods arguably the most impressive thing about this film is the casting of luke who was a total unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his resume and obviously washington knew he possessed the right goods to pull off the role despite its flaws antwone fisher is an intriguing look into the real life of an estranged enigmatic individual it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make you wish that small children didn t have to endure such horrors,positive

there are some good things about this film it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the nazi propaganda machine was for one thing it also shows the main character antoine moreau a \( fictional \) famous french mime having his eyes opened to the reality of the nazis final solution to the jewish problem brought to a czech town that has been given to the jews by the nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the swiss red cross delegation hopefully persuading them that the germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed moreau changes his original idea for the performance hoping to get a silent message to the red cross that will let them know the true fate of jews \( and other undesirables \) at the hands of the nazis i ll briefly mention a couple of less than positive observations and then get into my main problem with the film the production values reminded me a bit of a made for tv movie and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture the image quality on the dvd could have been much better as well also the shanachie dvd release is version of the film that has been dubbed with english this is in the case of this film not very well done the cabaret singer for instance comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn t match her face or ethnicity in the least everyone in the film winds up with an english accent which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children stella \( portrayed by linda jablonska \) her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl she develops a bit of a crush on antoine which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show with her as one of the leads who is kind and supportive and friendly to her who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect the problem i had was with one scene in particular stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police she bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence in the process of getting away she gets muddy scrapes herself bloody in a few places and tears her clothing she goes to moreau s hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window when he opens it he is shocked at her condition lets her into the room and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes asking what had happened he then draws a bath for her so she can wash herself as moreau sits down still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her she steps into the bath just before she pulls her dress over her head she says to him no looking he shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says of course then repairs to the adjoining bedroom where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy a moment later he hears a noise and looks up to see stella emerge from the bathroom completely naked in a full frontal nude shot moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers suggesting that she warm herself she climbs into the bed he covers her up and steps away to the other side of the room there is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred he has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy this shot only lasts a few seconds but i feel that regardless of the director s reasoning for shooting it in the first place it could have been left out if the point was to show that moreau has either had morals all along or that he has acquired them it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways earlier in the film stella had witnessed one of her caregivers semi nude in moreau s hotel room \( stella saw this from outside \) given her schoolgirl crush on moreau it seemed natural for her to become upset over this as a result however the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour this combined with the adult voice dubbed over stella s makes the scene even more disquieting there are some viewers who might argue that in europe standards involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the us in many instances i would wholeheartedly agree with them there is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of american culture and moral values and not a little bit of neurosis however the sexual objectification of children is something about which i feel very strongly and i think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that don t get me wrong i m not so prudish that i turn away from even full frontal nudity in a film if it s not gratuitous and it s an integral part of the storyline but here it involves a prepubescent girl and could have easily been left out it worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can t recognize an instance where it s not only unnecessary but potentially harmful i m glad i ve seen the film and i d recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations as noted above with all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the holocaust never happened i think it s vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen the czech film all my loved ones is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves seek it out n b this is the second time i have posted this exact review i noticed today \( 6 april 2006 \) that it has for some reason been removed from the site i ve re read what i ve written and i don t see anything objectionable or offensive the issues i have with the film are discussed straightforwardly if anyone objects to anything i ve written here i d like to know what it is,negative
while the dubbing may be a little annoying i still love this movie the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book don t expect the deepest movie in the world but do expect a quality martial arts film,positive
this is a great movie and i got it sent to me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you very much,positive
uhmm yah this is a low budget film but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck i ve seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art it s impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing sideline secrets for even untrained actors this is bad it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn t supposed to be someone in the backgroung i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom a garage into what was supposed to be a club and at the end of the home movie i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive \( quite so too \) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever so hard to be a soft core porn thriller in all seriousness this thing gave me a horrible migraine if you are stupid enough to actually buy this \( thankfully my roommate rented it \) invest in either a bottle of advil or a sledge hammer you ll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins,negative
i m not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre however most of the drills that i used with my team were effective this video is for the first or second year junior high coach \( like myself \) or any coach on the recreational level \( ie cyo and or pal coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter \) they are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough the narrator uses the expression dual purpose drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills for instance a drill with 3 players one shooter one rebounder and one passer a simple drill but after the shooter shoots he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot the timing is such that when he gets back to his spot the passer is already passing the ball thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when i tried it it worked great other drills also worked well like shots across the lane and a few of the rebounding drills the explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the x s and 0 s added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video the drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long the sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach the video could have been more detailed with more theory \( which i like \) but in truth it gives you just what it says some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy,positive
the only reason i m reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on so no let s be fair i did enjoy analyze this i really did though it wasn t a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life or even for the rest of the day and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie i didn t have very high expectations though because i rarely expect too much of sequels once again i was proven right analyze that illustrates perfectly why sequel sounds like such a dirty word the original film had a spark of originality the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again but of course that could never work it s the same problem with almost every comedic sequel those who haven t seen the original wouldn t understand the jokes and those who have already heard them before and that is why they fail time after time so what does this movie have a great comedic duo a couple of really funny guys yeah and fathers day had an even better pair look what happened to that a couple of good mafia jokes sure sure i even cracked a smile on several occasions but that isn t enough there are thousands of comedy films out there not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable and producers think they ll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas newsflash think again nobody watches these movies there s no reason to when you can just watch the original again,negative
just look how many are for sale thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is it has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting i fastforwarded about 70 of the movie and what got me was on the back it says family friendly im still laughing about that what has this world come to i would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn t buy or rent this movie im embarassed that i rented it please turn away now,negative
okay i gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it didn t play right but after viewing it without the technical problems i would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter a good addition to any collection ancient muscle conditioning not many dvd s out there on the subject i ve edited my original review and it won t allow me to give it more stars but i d give it 4 sorry mr keen if i cost you sales on this i commend you for putting this out,negative
i really forgot how good some of those first season early episodes were until i bought the season 1 dvd skin deep is probably the most entertaining episode of the series other standouts are china doll and j digger doyle what i enjoyed most was the 1982 crossover episode as the featuring gerald mcraney and jamison parker from simon and simon from season 2 also the simon episode emeralds are a girls best friend and although not as big a fan of later seasons the 2 part season 5 opener w a young unknown sharon stone playing a psycho big surprise there i found it neat with the discoesque theme song for the first 10 episodes too you could see how the 4 main characters found their niche as the season progressed,positive
i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series,positive
i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at it includes some great interviews with johnny shines robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r j s the parts where keb mo re enacts segments from r j s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features however that doesn t stop me watching this film again and again a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen,positive

great casting but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film it s so aggravating i want to chew my own leg off half way into it i know part of it is everyone is a talker of a various sort they re all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell i just don t think it works otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived the best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves it gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name mamet s an extraordinary genius writer but this did not belong on the screen,negative

first of all let me tell you this is not a date movie this is the most brutal graphic rape movie i have ever seen and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over for me that s exactly what i want when i see a movie one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be i loved this movie because it is very very well made and the acting performances are incredible yes the rapes are unforgiving in every respect and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times this is not a gory movie except for the last ten minutes it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity however it really needs to the untold story and ebola syndrome offset much of the carnage with humor but red to kill has absolutely nothing to smile about it is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending the story is pretty simple a psycho rapist is on the loose and he s going after a mentally retarded young dancer in the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality her plan succeeds to a certain extent but not like she planned it and the rapist comes after her full force the actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational and i might add the musical score is perfect the music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts the actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing one of the best performances on film you will ever see to end this this is a must see movie for fans of this genre and i m just getting started myself not the gore associated with the two previous cat iii movies i watched but something even more terrible and unrelenting and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it red to kill is flatout a good movie even considering the subject matter i highly recommend it,positive

i admit that my expectations were totally wrong concerning this film i was expecting a spanish reworking of noel coward s famous play about the dead returning to humorously haunt the living the advertising for volver in the local media certainly led me to have this expectation maybe this is why i found this film to be so perplexing and disappointing but even on it s own terms i found volver a difficult movie to enjoy others see a celebration of strong women i see a movie about murder incest deceit and theft every main character here is a criminal raimunda her mother her daughter all commit one crime or another some truly monstrous who is there to admire this is empowerment i m trying to avoid spoilers here but suffice to say there is not one truly likable character in this whole film aside from the overall unpleasantness of the movie a director as experienced as almodovar should have produced a tighter work than this there are numerous loose plot threads here the whole subplot concerning the jerry springer like tv show didn t really make any sense the restaurant owner seems to like raimunda but nothing comes of this in fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out with no resolution when the movie ended my first thought was what that s it it s over people might say well life has loose ends but this is a movie not life it should have an ending i know i m definitely in the minority concerning volver my wife thinks i m nuts for not liking this film but i really think the emperor has no clothes here,negative
is larry an actual redneck or is it all really a joke inside larry s mind i sometimes think that dan whitney \( larry s real name \) knows what he s doing i think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him he is openly mocking them and when they might get a tad uncomfortable but then he ll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine and they love him again dan larry started out as a normal comedian \( there s footage of him on youtube before his larry incarnation \) and wasn t really getting anywhere with that so he became a redneck and is a multi millionare now but all his redneck fans think of larry as a regular guy despite the fact that larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only nycers live in \( for the record nycers don t all live in fancy houses there s a lot of working class people in nyc who live in regular houses and regular apartments \) so larry is taking advantage of illiterate easily amused rednecks just put on a flannel shirt fart wear a confederate flag and say you hate liberals then fleece the rednecks i don t think larry really has a redneck mentality \( even though he s originally from nebraska so he has some hillbilly cred so to speak \) i think he s just making a ton of money off of easily amused people,negative
intimacy isn t about titillation or tanned toned hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays instead it s about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely physical relationship both are empty individuals and briefly find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding the relationship and the film only falters when the film moves outside the seedy flat that the liaisons take place in the wordless arrangement can only work while everything is strictly anonymous and once jay \( rylance \) delves into claire s \( fox \) personal life their apparently simple relationship becomes more complicated it s also here that the film briefly slumps jay encounters claire s taxi driver husband played by an uncharacteristically off form timothy spall speaking nonsense and totally over the top his scenes are almost unbearably dreary i can certainly see why claire would want peace and quiet and intense sex after listening to that intensely boring man twitter on still it doesn t make his scenes any better to watch despite that though the film regains it footing and ends strongly even timothy spall s character shows some hidden depths however intimacy works best as a comment on the relationships people trap themselves in it s easier to stay in an unhappy relationship than walk out and starting something new takes courage jay and claire are unable to escape their empty lives except in their sexual relationship really both are cowards neither is happy but neither makes a serious effort to change their circumstances sex is a temporary answer to a permanent problem and until they reach out for something more neither will be happy the film had an increasing energy which i liked and i m sure you would like it too if you let yourself inside the film,positive
let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers weren t the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year s supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it s absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character s interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it s now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still didn t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they re cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language,negative

this would be a steal at twice the price i don t know what possessed spike lee to offer five of his best movies at such a low price do the right thing is a brilliant movie capturing both the rhythms and tensions of lee s beloved brooklyn which he would return to time and again lee is at his best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character driven movies jungle fever and mo better blues stand out in this regard because they are first and foremost about people jungle fever introduced the great samuel l jackson as well as launched wesley snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an inter racial love affair jackson stole most of the scenes however as the drug addled brother who simply couldn t get his act straight no matter how hard he tried mo better blues exposed lee s love for jazz moody and atmospheric with denzel washington delivering a solid performance the film tries to recapture the spirit of the harlem renaissance clockers was his crime drama with plenty of tension crooklyn revolved mostly around amusing family disputes with alfre woodard as a strong mother figure it was probably the least satisfying of the five but fun to watch just the same lee embelishes his movies with such rich cinematic color and offers numerous fascinating camera angles such as his now famous walking scenes in jungle fever not since gordon parks had someone done so much for black cinema rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70 s,positive
wow i had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful haunting score to match i m glad our pleas have been heard with new high definition equipment coming down in price i can t think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema update is this the region 2 4 version that was released overseas if so we are in for a real treat,positive

overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal s performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it wasn t making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing didn t like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it s normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one,negative
absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen i saw it first in 1995 on video i believe never saw it or heard of it on the big screen anyway it s proof positive that a great directorial job with actors \( human and animal \) who believe in a story about real human failings lightheartedness and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life i had to see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as good as i thought it deals with real suffering \( including death revenge and anger \) and then redemption don t look for the classic happy ending but an ending which is consistent with the themes in the movie and is very satisfying after a little thought the movie completely pulls you in \( without your realizing it \) and works its magic on your mind but don t expect it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently throughout the movie often unexplained at first fluke also seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and compassionate toward my family especially i sort of got it the next day and you will love fluke the dog the movie is about a dog but it s really about so much more even though the dog scenes are great the subject matter at times is rather charged and there is violence and death \( human and animal \) so please be prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with you,positive

this is a typical \( semi slapstick \) gaiday film it is corny well produced and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy the subtitles are just fine you do not have to understand any russian to laugh at this movie buy it and enjoy,positive
seriously the sound is the worst i have encountered on any dvd release a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles there is a lot of video jittery things going on it all adds up to my conclusion that the dvd version is transfered from a very very bad analog copy on top of all the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled dont buy this unless you are a fanatic wkw fan who already own all other releases,negative
don t know about anyone else but the dvd i purchased had lousy video the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either i know the concert was indoors but i ve seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem,negative
this movie captures faithfully what is in my imagination when i read the book even though it was made several years ago it s still a fantastic movie timeless,positive
the hand of fear is not top notch all time classic who even producer philip hinchcliffe doesn t like it very much the only reason it was likely selected for dvd release over such classics as the seeds of doom or terror of the autons is probably because it s sarah jane s farewell story many stories during the hinchcliffe holmes years of who sometimes referred to as the golden age of doctor who sometimes referred as the gothic horror period were based on movies the seeds of doom was based on the day of the triffids horror of fang rock was based on and then there were none if not based on an actual film many were inspired in general by the look and feel of the hammer horror films the hand of fear was inspired by the hands of dr orlac the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer the story starts out great beginning with a fantastic in joke rock quarries were very frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets here the doctor and sarah land in a rock quarry on earth and sarah thinks they re on an alien planet after an accident with a detonation sarah finds eldrad s hand and starts saying she he it must live a lot eldrad must live \( high note on must \) she takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating the story thus far is excellent and sarah jane possessed by eldrad is genuinely creepy though why she s dressed as andy pandy i ll never know extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core also extremely effective is eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant s core and then slowly emerging the show goes downhill quick once eldrad doctor and co head to eldrad s planet producer hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch i agree for some reason once eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge furthermore sarah s farewell seems entirely forced the hand of fear overall is still good stuff though and is well worth owning it is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the tardis interior \( why they didn t stick with the awesome jules verne ish interior i have no idea \),positive
i was delighted to see more than one shower scene all natural different body types you will not be disappointed,positive
the movie is one of my favorites works on both a romantic level and a comic level but where s the widescreen todays consumers are more educated \( thank god \) and they ve almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen you lose the top and bottom of the movie they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd it is for all intents and purposes incomplete who s going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible,negative
one only needs to watch ball of fire to realize the depth of barbara stanwyck s incredible talent i d match her up against any actress of her era or any other era here is a woman who can rip your heart out even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi dimensions of her characters sugarpuss o shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive good looking gentleman but she also shows her love to the other professors 1941 was stanwyck s greatest movie year she made meet john doe and the lady eve in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything from drama to comedy to musicals and of course westerns while stanwyck s singing is not on a par with her other talents \( her singing was dubbed in ball of fire \) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film \( this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer \) bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting she couldn t sing or dance \( as barbara did in ball of fire lady of burlesque this is my affair and banjo on my knee \) katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical she couldn t sing \) joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she couldn t sing doris day was brilliant in comedy musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy the same with judy garland rare is the talent who could do it all i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all drama comedy westerns musicals heroine or villainess stanwyck s work is always first class even when applied to material that is not she was simply the greatest and i m sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in 1941 for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses the movie ball of fire is great fun from beginning to end stanwyck and cooper are unbeatable and the other professors are hilarious to watch as well there is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch,positive
this dvd d ok it has the original program in it and some new features although i was a bit dissapointed as the new features only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters and the t mac ending goes for like 5 mins and the quality isnt that great,positive
i hate to admit i actually own this thing on vhs and unless my mind is going more than usual i have this cut of the movie too double \( and more \) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of dvd we get at least four issues of terminator 2 but none of robinson crusoe on mars i personally am sick of it director s cuts unrated editions and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet no wonder i ve taken to borrowing nearly all my dvds from the public library no you generally don t get them the day they come out but honestly when was the last time you purchased a movie from hollyweird that was worth keeping don t do it,negative

we purchased this dvd because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it s a great supplement to reading books he loves this dvd and we love the variety in it s approach we didn t realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years,positive
whenever i think of the second world war the two places i usually think about in terms of carnage is the eastern front and the war between nazi germany and soviet russia the other is the pacific campaign between the usa and japan one of the reviewers wrote i m glad the russian won so am i and what a bloody war it was the number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe except asia seem pale in comparison the russians suffered greatly at the hands of the germans and the german army paid one hell of a steep price also it was in the east where the germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind it was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of jews the german program of the final solution everything i have ever read about the second world war concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind boggling it s as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last this documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies from barbarossa to berlin it is one of the best documenatries out there at least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front i don t believe this is the definitive documentary as more and more information is being released now that the soviet union is no more but for now i highly recommend this film stars 4 5,positive
travolta was great in saturday night fever but this country version just didn t work although he s a good actor he just was wrongly cast in this film,negative
this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film s mood i m not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition s music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition,negative
i thought the movie was alright but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus i am sure it is on purpose but i just don t get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price,negative
the only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it the writing was terrible the plot so unrealistic and the special effects horrible this is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made why haley mills agreed to star in it is beyond me,negative
dracula how dare you call yourself a horror fan without even seeing it you don t have to like it but damn it you should at least see it you can thank dracula for all the gothic imagery that s been used time and time again in movies throughout the years right up to this very day you can also thank dracula for all the goth chicks running around and that s either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes dracula s not my favorite movie from universal s golden era but i ve seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before i buy the farm lugosi managed to create the dracula they even discuss this in the documentary on the disc but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of lugosi s dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of dracula up even with all the different actors who ve played the role over the years \( some turning in wonderful performances some not so wonderful \) they all seem to be in lugosi s shadow somehow coz he just was dracula lugosi gave a voice to dracula ever do a dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one what voice did you \( or they \) use lugosi s of course however i don t think i d like this film half as much if it hadn t had been for dwight frye as renfield frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle he is to the character of renfield what lugosi is to dracula sorry tom waits just didn t cut the mustard for me this film is many years old and probably wouldn t be considered frightening by a five year old kid in fact it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with lugosi s exaggerated stares hand movements and dialogue not to mention frye s overacting as well but the fact of the matter is this movie scared the pants off people in it s time when was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them who knows and it s not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society in fact i doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film anyhow you owe it to bela dwight and yourself to check it out as for the other films in the set it s kinda hit and miss but none of them are bad by any means apparently somewhere along the lines dracula fathered two kids \( \) coz we have dracula s daughter and son of dracula neither movie is all that bad dracula s daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse dracula s son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle chaney makes a decent enough vampire but this son didn t inherit his father s suaveness and charisma the spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version house of dracula s kind of the odd one out as it s really a sequel to house of frankenstein which itself is a sequel to frankenstein meets the wolf man house of dracula is best viewed as a double feature with house of frankenstein like the frankenstein and wolf man sets this one has an interesting documentary tracing dracula from bram stoker s novel right up to the frank langella film version also sliming his way into this set is stephen sommers flapping his gums again about how dracula influenced his piece of crap van helsing movie don t ask me why i watched this feature maybe i was looking for a reason to get pissed anyhow with a price tag like this and five universal classics it certainly sold me,positive

i had higher expectations when i purchased this dvd i was not disappointed technically but i was extremely disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of rachel york she couldn t seem to decide whether she wanted a pop jazz or traditional musical theatre sound her voice was all over the place furthermore i found her character very annoying she was screechy and not at all vunerable i preferred kathryn grayson s performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable witty and charming as well as screechy demanding and somewhat tyrannical truly i could barely watch this entire video and at the end i could have cared less if fred and lilli got together i think that was the most powerful statement for me the production was acted \( or directed \) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top can today s directors please leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves everything need not be a commentary i wish i had seen marin mazzie because i heard she was incredible rent this before buying it or better yet do what i did and buy it used it hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth,negative
in america is a near perfect movie dealing w grief and learning to live again after tragedy it is also about hope the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks besides a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child s camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see if for nothing else than the performances of mateo and young kristie just amazing,positive

alright own up which idiots are responsible for the release of this musicals collection since when have pinky and island in the sun been musicals these two movies are hard hitting dramas with a similar inter racial relationships theme would someone please tell them that just because harry belafonte sings the title song over the credits this does not make island in the sun a musical i suppose in their book because shirley bassey sings the title song over the credits this makes goldfinger a musical too it makes me so mad that we have idiots in charge of releasing these great old movies who have no idea what they are doing it seems to be a case of oh just grab six movies off that shelf and lump them together if they don t know which are the best titles to release in a certain set why don t they ask someone who does know,negative
the wolf man legacy set a no brainer like all the classic universal legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone jack pierce s make up and wolfman creation are still the best this set along with dracula and frankenstein legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with you still need abbott and costello meets frankenstein to truely complete the series,positive
i can t believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd take advantage of the low price and buy this now i m no expert on the hot rod scene but this was very enjoyable the footage of pinstripe artist skratch is worth the price alone i would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this you get to see the creative process of some great project cars as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members i will definitely be watching this one a few times,positive

it s difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of alfred hitchcock s masterworks especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950 s until the 1960 classic psycho but 1946 s notorious is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film first there is a sharp intensely plotted script by the estimable ben hecht that focuses on alicia huberman the daughter of a convicted nazi spy and t r devlin an american agent hired to convince alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo nazis based in rio de janeiro this means she would have to seduce and eventually marry alex sebastian a key group member who has never gotten over alicia in his heart this triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers a primarily poker faced cary grant portrays devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance in a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism devlin falls in love with alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her claude rains on the other hand imbues sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a nazi war criminal a year after wwii ended quite a daring feat within the film s historical context at the vortex though is ingrid bergman who probably gives her most accomplished performance as alicia at the time she was deified as the chaste mother superior in leo mccarey s harmless the bells of st mary s with bing crosby bergman turned a smart corner here as a loose woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for devlin at which point she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the na ve sebastian to her alluring charms ethereally beautiful and constantly pained she conveys much of her character s feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and grant portray two people who can t admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it their failure to communicate leads to alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy the chemistry between the two legends is palpable especially in the then controversial three minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy however above all this is a hitchcock film the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at sebastian s mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into alicia s hand clasping the cellar key which she passes to devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles there are intriguing performances on the sidelines with louis calhern as the head of the american agency in rio and the intimidating madame konstantin as alex s ice cold mother both displaying a machiavellian spirit to get what they want the criterion collection has done another masterful job with their dvd package including an alternative audio commentary track featuring renowned hitchcock scholar marian keane providing insightful scene specific analysis and film historian rudy behlmer as was common with movie hits of the day the movie was recreated in condensed form for radio and the 1948 lux radio theater adaptation starring the voices of ingrid bergman and joseph cotten is included as well there are also lots of still photos a collection of trailers and teasers and even production correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and alternate endings for the more anal retentive among us this is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of hitchcock bergman grant or rains,positive

we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me it is one of the best films ever made now with red dragon i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is anthony hopkins the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter i don t think this movie would have been as good if hopkins wouldn t have played the role of lecter i own the original manhunter which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role this is a great thriller film edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham when a series of serial killing style murders start graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as the tooth fairy he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is like silence of the lambs we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence this movie holds true to the book with the same name we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s o t l without going further into all the details of the movie i ll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s o t l and the movie hannibal also ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon for anyone who hasn t seen this movie it s a must see,positive
first of all the trailer was the best part of the movie had me expecting a totally different story second the story i got turned out to be the grinch who stole christmas crossed with it s a wonderful life \( the latter of which was even more boring than this hokey remake \) doesn t that therefore make santa clause 3 so cliche so done before third the kids in the audience seemed to enjoy it but man was i bored \( i actually enjoyed the original santa clause so i can t blame the boredom factor on the fact that this is supposed to be a kids movie \) fourth i found the christmas council to be extremely offensive \( read inappropriately pagan for a movie that is ostensibly about christmas \) whoop whoop whoop spoiler alert spoiler alert read no farther if you haven t already seen the movie fifth i found jack frost s conversion to be zzzzzzzzzzz whazzat oof i must have dozed off for a minute sorry now what was i saying oh yeah poor pitiful evil jack frost \( ho hum \) wouldn t it have been much better to kill him off than convert him i mean come on is the converted jack frost supposed to be an improvement yucky he s disgusting i liked him much better as a villain better hair better duds i say just freeze him off next to a wooly mammoth be done with him or bring him back in next year s sequel \( because you know there s going to be one \) for goodness sake do we always have to embrace our inner icicle \( hurl \) sixth not only jack but there was so much about this movie that just didn t make sense \( yawn \) okay i m done with it it s not even worth the time i took for it,negative

this a dreadful example of what jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat husbands lovers the only reason to watch it would be because mamie van doren was also in it but be aware \( and i read that in a biography about jayne \) that in their contracts was specified that they would not appear together in any scene whatsoever so you see them separately in different scenes also be aware that if you blink you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties conclusion get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ol south or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl,negative
this film is boring so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop this is a soap opera about politics oil companies it s weird jump around style is confusing pointless do yourself a favor and don t bother w this garbage,negative

this thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours characters weren t given clear introductions or motivations they react in ways that don t make much sense and the accents come go and change into new accents altogether while the format reminds me of a primetime soap the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved,negative

pick any house on any street pick any random two people \( man and woman \) give them a script and let them go wild i promise you could make this movie work better than the producers nothing in this movie stood out and everything about it was boring the acting and settings in this movie are just horrible by the end you want everyone to die just to become interested now i don t usually give bad ratings and i really like b horror films but the lack of effort here is unbelievable just nothing to interest me,negative
i liked this workout the first time i bought it as her fatburning workout the second time i bought it re packaged i thought it was a fluke this time i bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training so it must be different nope i have 5 kathy smith videos all three with different titles and covers only three different contents i feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company one month later and i have yet to receive a response,negative
this is an excellent film which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor i was very disapointed in the quality of the release the picture quality is poor inter titles appear to be missing and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don t match the action on screen it s a shame because a film like this one deserves much better,negative
better than submerged but that s not saying much my wife and i have seen almost all of stevies movies and next to the foreigner and submerged this movie ranks up there in the horrid category what is up with the voice dubbed over when stevie was mumbling we kept trying to guess whose voice that was \( burgess meredith the guy who played the other terminator on t2 etc \) that was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film i can t see why blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe maybe there are more of us die hard ss fans than i realized even so save your money do not buy rent steal vie,negative
this is a wonderful show and very true to the band s recent live performances albeit with a condensed songlist i give it only 4 stars because i had the pleasure of seeing mr winwood and band live and the sound stage gig seems just a tad below that experience which is admittedly an unfair comparison nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso \( actually a band of virtuosos \) consider it 4 5,positive
as the reviews below indicate arthur has a lot of fans when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful screwball comedy \( although over time times readers perhaps more discerning than vincent have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars \) and bravo listed it 10 on its list of best comedies \( see below \) i first saw dudley moore in foul play thought he was very funny based upon that i bought 10 and arthur as it turned out a downward trajectory what i dislike about arthur is moore playing a loud obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes and minelli playing a salt of the earth working girl who loves arthur for himself not for his 750 million fortune even john gielgud who was great in the loved one a much better comedy can t resurrect this turkey okay folks start casting your negative votes in the meantime here s the bravo 100 best comedies list 100 anchorman 99 the birdcage 98 school of rock 97 happy gilmore 96 four weddings and a funeral 95 harold kumar go to white castle 94 waiting for guffman 93 the aristocrats 92 father of the bride 91 revenge of the nerds 90 clueless 89 slapshot 88 team america 87 the kentucky fried movie 86 zoolander 85 dirty rotten scoundrels 84 silver streak 83 sister act 82 tootsie 81 half baked 80 lost in america 79 three amigos 78 bananas 77 flirting with disaster 76 ghostbusters 75 dumb and dumber 74 trading places 73 city slickers 72 moonstruck 71 roxanne 70 the nutty professor \( eddie murphy \) 69 the blues brothers 68 broadcast news 67 kingpin 66 dazed and confused 65 office space 64 this is spinal tap 63 manhattan 62 the pink panther 61 election 60 when harry met sally 59 police academy series 58 private benjamin 57 swingers 56 young frankenstein 55 bull durham 54 ferris bueller s day off 53 dr strangelove 52 meet the parents 51 national lampoon s vacation 50 the princess bride 49 american pie 48 american graffiti 47 9 to 5 46 the incredibles 45 raising arizona 44 sixteen candles 43 what about bob 42 harold and maude 41 austin powers 40 monty python and the holy grail 39 mrs doubtfire 38 best in show 37 dodgeball 36 good morning vietnam 35 beetlejuice 34 rushmore 33 clerks 32 groundhog day 31 the big lebowski 30 the 40 year old virgin 29 legally blonde 28 annie hall 27 a fish called wanda 26 wayne s world 25 meet the fockers 24 bill ted s excellent adventure 23 big 22 beverly hills cop 21 shampoo 20 the jerk 19 wedding crashers 18 stripes 17 m a s h 16 old school 15 fast times at ridgemont high 14 napoleon dynamite 13 naked gun series 12 the producers 11 pee wee s big adventure 10 arthur 9 ace ventura pet detective 8 blazing saddles 7 the wedding singer 6 airplane 5 south park bigger longer uncut 4 there s something about mary 3 shrek 2 caddyshack 1 animal house my suggested additions the loved one leap of faith used cars eulogy and drop dead gorgeous,negative
this dvd was the first one released by michael buble and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances there are segments of performances but the editing and fast wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect the performances get largely lost what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking clubbing gambling womanizing and generally acting like rowdy frat boys if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like i highly recommend caught in the act this dvd lives up to it s name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster caught in the act is slick glossy flashy enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience i ve seen buble perform live twice and i can attest that caught in the act is just about as good as being there,negative
i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness but this movie is not in the same league first of all the plot is slow and boring bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move this really hampers the action aspects of the movie the dialogue aspect is not much better if you like bruce my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of jack of all trades episodes it is a lot more fun and has the real bruce,negative
while i absolutely love the show on pbs this season was mispackaged the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1 2 unfortunately i didn t try watching this disc until several months after i bought it if you buy this be sure you view it promptly to be certain it s the correct series,negative
back in the 1980s back before every television show was csi city of your choice and law order crime division of your choice there was a veritable plethora of well written clever hour long mystery programmes magnum p i murder she wrote moonlighting hart to hart the a team to name just a few and this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from \( not counting pbs \) but far and away the best of these mystery shows \( and perhaps the most under rated \) was remington steele in which pierce brosnan \( with second billing \) and stephanie zimbalist fought crime with style dash wit comedy and a bit of romance the series with its rat a tat dialogue vaguely deco feel \( a slight deco revival was the only good thing about 80s d cor \) and occasional zaniness at times harkens back to the wonderful preston sturges esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and 40s indeed it s clear from the moment that brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of classic hollywood but he was a cary grant for our times devastatingly handsome in dapper saville row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as grant s \( as an aside it s also clear that brosnan was born to play james bond truly who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor albeit belatedly we won t get into the infamous season five vs bond debacle \) in the entertainment field there are actors with a lowercase a \( pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays \) actors with a capital a \( truly impressive sorts such as judi dench vanessa redgrave and anthony hopkins \) and then there are stars brosnan is clearly the lattermost bright and luminous zimbalist as sleuth laura holt is spunky and makes a valiant attempt to be rosalind russell to brosnan s grant but somehow she falls slightly flat nevertheless there s no denying the chemistry between the two which is what really makes the show \( this is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously didn t get along whilst filming the series \) references to classic hollywood are constant and amusing remington steele the \( sort of \) reformed con man with a heart of gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film \( joseph cotton orson wells the third man british lion film corporation 1949 is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series as are cary grant films and ironically the occasional bond reference \) the show was scored by the wonderful henry mancini he of charade \( a grant reference yet again \) the pink panther and breakfast at tiffany s fame \( among many others \) which of course adds to the caper romantic feel of the show \( by the way i ll take the somewhat chaste clinches of remington and laura over the sordidness of sex and the city to daydream about any day of the week \) i m so pleased that remington steele has been released on dvd i was seven years old when it debuted and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time \( i was a sophisticated child \) but i hadn t seen it since and once again have found myself charmed by each and every episode for those who are too young to remember the series check it out it s much more worthwhile than anything on the air now and for those of you who do remember it revisit it s worth your time and money,positive
i am a sci fi space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley the cast was solid the director has talent and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well right nope this was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense the formula kept repeating over and over something goes wrong houston advises astronauts do something all is well lather rinse repeat boring very boring i never once flet any real tension except for the initial problem which obviously was not that bad because everything went well in the end the problem is that all of the issues the men faced were handled so matter of factly rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked it was just yeah attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be ok i never felt that the astronauts were really threatened maybe a few times but only for a minute or two some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting how so i must ask nothing really happened it was not emotional at all since the struggles of the men were so poorly portrayed to each his own i guess but 4 1 2 stars geeez just because tom hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks the family interactions were pretty standard crying wife kids asking questions annoying media attention etc etc yeah i could feel for the characters to some extent but again this movie needed a lot more real tension and panic to be meaningful i will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and star trekkish special effects too bad i had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored not recommended,negative
i grew up with the original ds i also saw the two spin off movies house of dark shadows and night of dark shadows needless to say i was extremely excited about the revival and i wasn t disappointed i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera i looked forward to 3 30 every day after school it s too bad that the gulf war killed it yes it did i was there after the sunday monday miniseries that friday was to air the first episode however it was pre empted by coverage of the war too too bad i taped it but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over i am so glad to know that i can order it now in it s magical entirety i m ordering it right now thank you amazon if you are a fan of things that go bump in the night you will love this series,positive
with the new year just more than six hours away i must tell you that no matter a full moon half moon quarter moon or no moon at all please avoid the flick darkwolf for many moons to come what a joke what a silly stupid insult to one s intelligence the script could have been written by my dog stan and even then i give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine let s put it this way have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much you simply didn t give a if they got blown away i was hoping the entire cast got mulched by mr wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser go darkwolf take a few chucks out of this cast its director producer writer and editors as quickly as possible and don t wait until the next full moon darkwolf is an insult to motion pictures more so it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as the wolf man wolfen and the howling not to mention the tongue in cheek horror classic an american werewolf in london need i say more darkwolf has no bite it s claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion the box claims this flick to be half man half wolf pure evil in reality it is half whole stupid half whole worthless and pure get my drift at midnight as we turn another page and the new year unfolds i promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of mary hartman mary hartman much more than darkwolf i m off to watch yet another new year s flick before dawn i need to make amends to lon chaney jr before midnight bottom line it was a film you didn t really care where the wolf came from or where the werewolf was going pitiful embarrassing i ve seen the bad moon rising but this one makes me wish it would set,negative
truly his greatest film i have seen thus far not only is one taken in by this movie but it allows one to forget that it s filmed in black and white the boy elvis of course is even more beautiful in king creole which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture the soundtrack is admirable he delivered it with such effervescence such pride one can t help but fall in love with him and this movie too bad elvis was so loyal to col parker he could have been the great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be this film certainly promised it,positive
let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie 1 it is incredibly beautiful animation 2 the music is amazing 3 i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i don t like about the movie 1 the characters are not developed at all 2 you get the feeling your only skimming the surface like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3 it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 well that is becuase of the story line and plot the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end i just kept thinking there has to be more but there wasn t the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn t find its parents this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don t buy it rent it first i m not saying its a bad movie by any means just a bit empty for me just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good don t let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series,negative

i was watching cinemax one night bored out of my mind and unable to sleep when this movie came on the acting made me laugh the premise made me laugh everything about it made me laugh hey at least it was fun to make fun of anyway just kinda mad that i wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap,negative
i give it 3 stars for porn and 2 stars for a movie therefore collectively you have your single star by all means i suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn beat off and then watch a real movie caligula blows literally and royally it is a little under 3 hours which seemed like 3 days and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film the small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn the most triumphant scene in the movie is where the roman soldiers attack the phallus humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro this movie is ridiculous in order to enjoy this one must be completely perverted and dimwitted,negative
this minnesota filmed movie reportedly has a cult following and the reason is not far to realize joe mazzello joe is a 1990s and 21st century motion picture phenomenon his presence in this movie is so realistic and life life that you forget that he is acting he was pivotal in carrying this movie how so may i add that joe s axiom for acting is simply just make it look real he achieved this to a stellar degree in the cure and also in the later fare simon birch incredible acting and i know good acting for i was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical score for it no i am not going to name drop the cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social geographical educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly forged and may i add that it is a friendship of rare mutual concern honest caring and warm affection no matter how many times i watch it tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film joe is the best,positive
this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you d expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a special edition,negative
i m making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back the performances are thin and uneven the plot is inconsistent and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of friends to be fair this movie does face several major obstacles it has the misfortune to depend on the acting of glorified ken doll freddie prinze jr and the vastly overrated julia stiles and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges it also attempts to survive the intrusion of ashton kutcher it fails on all counts i do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre nor do i hate the teen movie sub genre under which some would place down to you \( in fact can t hardly wait is one of my favorite movies \) i simply hate bad movies and this movie is a true abomination if you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull then by all means buy this dvd if however you value your sanity then please do not make the same mistake i did stay far far away from this movie,negative
in 1973 director nicholas roeg took a daphne du maurier story about a strained family situation added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction cast wonderful talented actors such as donald sutherland and julie christie and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror the unmissable don t look now six years later cronenberg obviously oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared down imagery and understated elegance of the roeg picture decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme with disasterously boring results to synopsise the plot frank carveth s estranged wife is crazy and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist s controversial institute suspecting her of abusing their daughter he removes her from his wife s care to the strenuous objections of her shrink several people connected to wifey s emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead and carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother s other set of kids so it s david cronenberg so what performances and direction as well as screenplay are all simply mundane there s barely a shred of the sleek polished talent we have come to recognise as david cronenberg and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic american horror movies as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer director it s almost got the sense of isolation of the shining but there are too many incidental characters it s almost got the same sense of murder by numbers as hallowe en but lacks the decisive action of that movie it s close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood gone awry as carrie \( and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to piper laurie \) but samantha eggar s performance is too overblown makeup effects too are over ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama in that they just look silly of course you could say the same for the exorcist nowadays but where that film still has the incredible strength of ellen burstyn s and linda blair s performances all the brood has to go on is some deformed alien figures that hiss a lot it s not good in short where a movie matters most the brood fails wholly to deliver instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema a note on the subtext it s difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein sure topics like the state of the nuclear family and the negative effects of a mother s love are riveting things when handled properly unfortunately when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone who could care less about subtext i couldn t,negative
i had heard about this flick being talked about as the chinese charlie s angels it took me a while but i finally popped it in wow this has to be on of the coolest movies i have seen in a while i was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why i liked it so much the story is about these 2 women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living sweet i am not going to lie i wasn t paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever all of these girls know martial arts or at least they can put their legs up really high and director corey yuen puts in some of the best wirework i have seen this movie certainly isn t going to win any awards for it s high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that i wish i could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot posters so on top of this being an amazingly fun movie yasuaki kurata shows up for the finale corey yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie if you have seen some of coery s 80 s stuff like yes madam or even the newer fong sai yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema \( example ninja in the dragon s den \) kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever legend of a fighter which was made in 1981 well at 56 years old he looks just as good i was so amazed by this movie i have watched it 3 nights in a row and i will continue this routine for a while \) the picture quality on the columbia tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles also good 5 1 sound cantonese track the original mandarin track and a horrible english dub,positive
this movie is typical hollywood anti war anti military anti american trash the show biz liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the left wing tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as baby killing drug crazed monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers a much better and far more honest film,negative

very short game took about 2 hours to finish it \( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it because as always their system is unavailable please try again later took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy \) as to the game you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary gameplay was average for a shooter it seems episodes basically translates to really short game which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something,negative

i stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago having nothing better to do i watched it my first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens i was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot you don t have to be stoned or even a stoner to enjoy this movie one reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film like your actualy there scrapping through life with the characters i guess i can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie not enough bells and whisels but if your up for something differnt give it a try by the way the movie was based on a book of the same name also very good and differnt,positive

all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn t like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious and the ending won t cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic which i found utterly depressing more to the point though who cares about the problems of these rich kids not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film check out less than zero another gloomy but solid \( underrated \) 80s film the worst 80s film is bright lights big city don t say i didn t warn you,positive
i heard that the nfl was releasing the past superbowls on dvd i was excited to say the least then i found out these are only highlight films a real dissappointment to say the least the films are available in their entirety why not release them i was willing to pay well over one hundred dollars for each box of ten super bowls as were several of the people that i was at a super bowl party with this year too bad the nfl fell short again,negative
this is a great show and very entertaining the story isn t the greek classic but it s a fine riff on it the songs are good and they grow on you as you watch i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character it s just a cartoon for pete s sake like some other reviewers i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing go the distance over the end credits but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version no importa la distancia sung by ricky martin and it is killer this one is well worth the money,positive
crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a true story of three australian soldiers in the boer war accused of killing prisoners and a dutch minister the british command is obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the germans who seem eager to join the war on the side of the boers to stay out the men claim they were only following orders orders which went against normal military practice this is a new type of warfare the boers fought as guerrillas not in uniform not by the rules the australians on trial felt they were engaging them on those terms the morality of war itself therefore is just as much on trial as these men they all lose in the end the trial scenes are well paced and the use of flashback creates just the right amount of tension also there are enough shady gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting well worth a watch,positive
great movie delivery of the order came in good time this 2 disc collector s edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions,positive

hey angry young man if you re going to just sit there all smug mr yeah i used to have a tv but i busted it cuz i just don t care doggie and make fun of this nation s fine secret service why don t you just go to an axis of evil nation and see how funny it is then when you re sucking on rocks to stave off the inevitable side effects of dehydration when if you want to go to the market to buy more rocks to suck on you have to whip yourself with metal shards tied to the end of long leather straps as you walk and just because you saved the sorry excuse for a young lady who will become a drug addict bag lady once she gets old enough to lose hope of realizing her dreams earns you no points in my book freedom doesn t come for free so quit whining about the draft dick trickle the moonlighting tie in is cute but quickly turns sour as bruce willis seems to have been off working on another die hard installment while the episode was being filmed and it s just not the same without those sarcastic wing dingers bet you didn t know lou ferrigno was scorsese s first choice for the lead but he wasn t willing to thin down for the role and he kept firing his language coaches,negative
a star is born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons by failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star s tragic downfall the film displays a schizophrenic quality there is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen this is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors it s the nature of the material itself perhaps if we were to see the james mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living the audience would understand what the garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters instead we see garland s character despairing over a not very likeable washed up drunk and we re left feeling as empty as the film itself,negative
this was a hugely disappointing film i did not see it on stage nor do i want to if it is ever resurrected it trivializes illness death god heaven range of human emotion and love in all forms i have grown up in a post aids world and can see so many problems far worse than aids i am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits while america focuses on such banal subject matter larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality,negative
the truth about cats and dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable refreshing movie janeane garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical depressed miserable pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want of course she s not really acting that s really her lock stock and barrel the miserable pessimistic vicious act isn t an act at all the fly in the ointment to this movie is that uma thurman is not a knockout of course some men would prefer the tall thin blonde over the short brunette but the basis of the movie hinges on uma being the gorgeous woman and janeane being average but it doesn t work when you believe it s the other way around uma thurman has certainly looked good in some movies but she looks haggard here bottom line a good film about the ugly duckling getting the guy based on the classic cyrano de bergerac story just like roxanne starring steve martin,positive
this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don t look now back in 73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense,positive
this movie was both entertaining and at times hilarious charlie sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist denise richards is funny as his ditzy shallow girlfriend and angie harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper also jon lovitz is hysterical as sheen s plastic surgeon best friend this movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor i highly recommend it,positive
great movie and it was a pleasure buying it through amazon,positive
i will make this short aykroyd candy two men who are hilarious together is of course hilarious the story is about a man who loves his family and is a middle class man going on vaction his relatives decide to join him without letting him know the relatives are totally diffren t from the family they join and seeing them mingle is a riot i say get this movie because everyone i know who has seen it all say the same thing i love that movie it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen,positive

i am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio i would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that i have enconter with two copies of this dvd the first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement so amazon promptly shipped out another the second copy didn t have a scratch but the movie hung up in the exact same place as the first annoying i am currently waiting on another copy but if it s bad i m giving up important consumers take my review very seriously because i suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the dvd they re just fans of the film and what an awesome film it is,negative
i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is what a waste of time maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in 1973 that time is past \( even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new \) now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated,negative
i remember going to great lengths to fit a matin e showing of heaven s prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera our little filmgoing party of detective film fans and alec baldwin groupies \( a k a my mom my stepfather and me \) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment baldwin who also served as co producer brought james lee burke s new orleans ex cop recovering alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke s characters and have some tangy tough guy gal dialogue they re hampered by two things 1 \) the film s slo o o ow pacing maybe the louisiana heat got to everyone not just baldwin of all the actors long island native baldwin sweats the most so much that it began to remind me of the sweating bullets gags with albert brooks in broadcast news and robert hays in airplane 2 \) a plot that as rendered in the film \( whether it s the fault of the screenwriter or the editor i can t be sure \) never quite follows through on any of its elements it s too bad because these elements could ve made for an exciting movie drug dealing illegal alien smuggling rival crime bosses \( one is played colorfully by eric roberts before he became a parody of himself essentially playing a southern fried version of his character from director phil joanou s 1992 thriller final analysis \) an adorable little salvadoran orphan girl \( named alafair by the robichouxs after dave s mom late in my pregnancy at the time i liked the name alafair so much i nearly changed my mind about naming my then unborn daughter siobhan \) and a bevy of beautiful beguiling women including earth mother kelly lynch vampy teri hatcher in a full frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time and mary stuart masterson looking like a young jessica lange in what was then a change of pace role for her a troubled stripper who loves robichoux despite the sexy promises in the movie s ads none of the ladies share anything with baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and or embraces maybe the climate was already so hot the filmmakers didn t want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor baldwin collapsing from heat prostration as my mom put it at the time i thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy dashing alec baldwin but he came up sweaty rumpled tired depressed and moving as if he was in slow motion if he d made love as many times as he got beaten up it would ve been the sexiest picture of 96 to be fair there are a number of strong characterization and action scenes but there s just too darn much talky molasses paced lag time between them and yet oddly some of the scenes end abruptly just as they re about to become intriguing perhaps joanou baldwin co could ve dredged a tighter more involving thriller out of this if they d whittled the 140 minute running time down to 105 minutes or so as heaven s prisoners is now well read james lee burke s books instead,negative
if you must see a cannibal film stick to cannibal holocaust the grindhouse release is well worth the money however the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful the picture quality is horrendous the movie is lacking any redeemable quality there are a few violent moments but just a few one of the absolute worst italian horror exploitation films made if cannibal holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films then ferox is the plan 9,negative
my first viewing of this film was a great disappointment i expected another jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy film with chevalier substituting for eddy and i emphatically did not like the film then i viewed the film a second time this time with the play by play voice over analysis by miles kreuger which comes as a extra bonus on this dvd suddenly i was seeing the film in a completely different light and absolutely loving this film this dvd is an absolute gem and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by miles kreuger not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s it is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming \( because he s talked to those who were \) kreuger s commentary alone is worth the price of this dvd after seeing this film for the first time you must go back and see it again through miles kreuger s eyes,positive

denzel washington is probably my favorite actor even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate he shone tom hanks well lemme quit hating the guy this is a well intentioned movie tom did a creditable job and we had extreme close ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy a passionate one though since he s still a latino after all actually this is a hollywood message movie and you know what that means it s about as subtle as michael moore those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie those who don t agree with the message stay as far away from it as possible there s a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy the way they stared at him reminded me of lao wei in china experiences denzel s character was reminded of segregation even though he s too young to remember it and started to care about tom hanks character aids discrimination is bad actually any discrimination at all is bad and that s the movie s message i agree with the message but still that s all we ve got as a totally irrelevant non sequiter if the name sam francisco means anything to you you ve seen subtle commentary on discrimination i love a great courtroom drama this one was merely good with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two hour film they had to take a few shortcuts here sad ain t it but even so a well intentioned film that i m glad i saw once not twice once is enough thank you,negative
sure this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics but the question you should be asking yourself is will it appeal to the average person the simple answer here is a loud and resounding no here are the reasons 1 \) unless you re a well bred blue blood who knows all about edward ii and loves shakespeare this is extremely hard to follow not just because of the archaic olde english speake but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence result if you re not lost you will soon will be and worse yet you won t care 2 \) don t be fooled by the lure of annie lennox she is an itsy bit of a bit player in the overall run of this movie and is for all intents and purposes inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an mtv commercial rammed in the middle of your programme 3 \) let s be clear about what you re getting for your 10 15 dollars it s not a movie at all but an arty pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie further the period is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short not what cutty edgy trendy theme within a theme are they trying to promote who knew such a tantillizing heart wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull,negative
those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been material for vh1 s the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple and when she does have more than 3 lines at once the complete lack of feeling expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang nails that is all i can say i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again,negative
i bought this because i was familar with the space ghost show and liked it and the fact that this was 50 off it is strange in an uncomfortable way and tends to be very long in parts,negative

this dvd is amazing perfectly puts the blues on display through the high points and the low points of the season the best thing about this dvd besides the flying is the respect they show the crew yeah the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff but they are faaaar from the stars of the show the maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide this dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do they truly go through the mill but they don t do a single thing with those blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly this is finally a dvd that shines the light on the pilots but makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots great job unlike the retired one who reviewed also \( great review by the way \) i would not like to be a pilot after seeing this i would rather get faaar more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it,positive
i have watched this film on my local pbs station at least 1 2 dozen times because it is soooooo good i have a mental vacation each time i find that my stress just goes away while watching this awe inspiring movie i highly recommend this film for the whole family,positive
i was very disappointed with this show having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd now i feel cheated the jokes are weak his inaccurate depiction of africa and his off the mark african accent were more annoying than amusing jamie was crude disgusting and even more disappointingly not funny at all he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn t his best performance he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly i do not recommend this dvd at all,negative
i was so pleased to find this movie on amazon com i had watched it as a child and pinned over it when i could not find it in stores over the years this is such a pure love story with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real there are too few unpretentious untampered romantic movies around these days most reveal too much literally but this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre,positive
it s strange this just came on fx and once it was on i was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing even though i ve already seen it \( in the theatres during its initial release run \) and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around even for all of the bad press that this movie got and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror this truly is one of my favorites from m night shyamalan this along with lady in the water \( another must have for me \) is a movie that i feel compelled to add to my collection as the other reviewers state it s not truly scary but more a suspenseful film as i actually find all of shyamalan s movies to be in my humble opinion he s not trying to provide movies best suited to halloween scare fest marathons but movies that are suspenseful and thought provoking as annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers there s thought put into each of his films unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like hostel and those damned saw movies \( enough already \) at least after seeing this in the theatre i felt that i d gotten my money s worth for the ticket price and this is definitely a movie that i feel i could watch repeatedly in my opinion the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film don t buy this if you re looking for a horror like the exorcist if that s what you want buy and watch the exorcist if you re looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen buy this movie even if you know what happens in the end i m sure you ll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time,positive
i ve been doing this dvd workout for two years and i still can t make it all the way through the level 2 workouts this video is incredibly challenging but i like that i can do the level 1 workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd,positive
the quality was good and the stories were also good i am on the list when the first season comes out this is like a tease,positive
this original version is much funnier than u s version the humor is dry and intelligent and the characters are very complex at times you feel sorry for them other times you love them and laugh with them and mostly you think they re idiots what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience it s not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over but this is one that i ve enjoyed each time,positive
this movie is basically about 12 yr old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 yr old worries about never getting out of this small town i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie,negative
this movie is definitely one of the better thrillers to come out since it s release it s action packed and full of tension in it s 90 minutes of right on time kurt russell always good does a great job and this is no exception the late great j t walsh in one of his last performances plays one of the best bad guys i can t recommend this film enough for those seeking thrills action and suspense i can t really say what is wrong with the film but i just felt that it didn t belong in the perfect category although maybe it should because it does answer on every call a movie to watch again and again,positive
maybe i loved the original one too much but this version of the story did not work for me i especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas stick with the first one it was perfect,negative
this is a fantastic movie the acting is superb and it keeps you guessing until the end nicole kidman deserved her oscar,positive
i was also disappointed with this dvd as is seemed to be a popular choice among amazon shoppers i think the title yoga for beginners is misleading as this dvd contains many advanced yoga routines also on the back of the dvd it said it contained a core workout 20 min but no such workout is actually on the dvd i purchase the pilates for inflexible people at the same time as this dvd and i much prefer it although i wish i d known that two of the workouts from the pilates dvd were on the yoga dvd before i bought them both,negative
i really loved this dvd there is some information for everybody beginners as well as advanced there is also a nice presence from paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album i was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing this dvd without being too personnal made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man i also enjoyed the discovery of the south african music their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country the many footages of the countryside were a pleasure which worked perfectly with graceland songs the anecdotes are meaningful witty funny deep depending on the situation none of them self indulgent or egotistical this dvd is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer s i would rank this dvd up there with the clash west way to the world and u2 the making of the joshua tree,positive
i could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety i think i made it about 45 minutes in despite many fine actors esp the always interesting jeff bridges who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles i simply could not connect and did not care about these people it was this huge budget american movie shorthand we re supposed to care because we ve been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else but it just doesn t work for me if i don t care this far into the movie it just won t happen visually beautiful and sky high production values on costumes and sets it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of but why don t we get faces like that in the major characters of course chris cooper has that kind of face but many others \( esp all the size 2 women in the supporting roles \) seem to have stepped out of a commercial the chicago tribune called this film sleek and beautiful i will completely agree with that but so are music videos i kept asking myself what is wrong what is misfiring i really wanted to like it some of it is the short hand story telling but the look was almost too pretty when the cinematography is this gorgeous you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger a mini series ultimately i began wondering if the original length was much longer and it was cut down so much that it became fractured and if that is the case my apologies to the director this is the kind of film that makes me ponder what is it that european film makers get that we lose in our big budget studio films is the system itself hurting some films by sanitizing and conforming them when they need to stick out like an unruly horse s nose at the starting gate very beautiful but no connection and not satisfying well that s a lot of things in hollywood in a nutshell isn t it there are lots of special features on this dvd but if i can t sit through the film i don t care about the extras so glad i borrowed this instead of buying it i hear the book is something wonderful,negative

even though tsui hark is one of my favorite hong kong directors this movie did not at all show his skill the story was poor along with the actors performances i may be a little biased since i love john woo and tsui hark killed their friendship by making this movie worth checking out but i would nt buy it if i were you,negative
die hard fans of writer director david cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in this sci fi horror tale that accounts for so many 5 star ratings by other reviewers that was not my reaction to this film it was slow uninteresting and the ending was a disappointment i give it only 2 stars the characters stumble through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are gamers duh cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles william defoe is completely miscast as a gas station attendant jennifer jason leigh s wardrobe looks like retro 1980 s jude law does well except for a couple of unexplained accent changes beware of the tag line that says existenz makes the matrix look like child s play this film is no where near the caliber of the matrix if you are not a cronenberg fan i recommend that you pass on this dull film,negative
ok this definately looks very promising i saw a version of this on the flix channel about three nights ago it was good if that is any indication on how good the show is then this collector s edition box set of the older series should be better i am going to purchase this soon once i purchase it i will let you know how good it really is i ll give another review once i purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes a month ago is when i really learned of this series so i am truly looking forward to watching this series goddess anjanee,positive

in this movie based on a true story we see jerry stahl played by ben stiller jerry is a geek hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing jerry has it all a hollywood mansion liz hurley a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some heroin jerry s heroin habit costs 6 000 a week but he is only earning 5000 \( \) per week one does not need a phd in advanced mathematics to realize this this spells trouble jerry eventually gets clean with the help of maria bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book one can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the drug scene i give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has maria bello in it although i still can t figure out why she finds jerry the geek so interesting his story is the same as any street junkie they all look the same to me when they are injecting heroin into their veins on the street,positive
saw the knock off series jeremiah when it was the classic star trek episode miri in which all the adults past puberty were killed by a virus originally meant to prolong life also saw it as the canadian tv series the tribe in which all the adults are killed by some sort of plague also read it in the kindling by jennifer armstrong a novel in which teenagers must care for the younger kids after a virus wipes out their memories and kills all adults i laughed when the amazon reviewer called the premise of jeremiah intriguing well the other works don t have luke perry or pretty f x maybe that s the intriguing part of this latest adaptation of one of the most overused themes in science fiction,negative
even though amanda is quite attractive the camera work is bad the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga dvd a bitter disappointment there are few close ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window a bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better if you are looking for an accidentally soft focus dvd of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost this is for you,negative

charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly played role as england s king henry the eigth who infamously married six different queens divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty capacious king laughton as ever is a marvel skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly cariacatured lout and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point this is all about the cleverly rendered script which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads and on the classy ensemble acting which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print \( i m writing in the year 2003 perhaps criterion or some other class act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon \) still fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot,positive

overproduction and heavy use of repetitive special effects \( such as rothbart s enlarged and projected image flying over the heads of siegfried and odette \) make this version of swan lake funny anorexia survivor evelyn hart s role as odette odile makes watching the video painful she is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing i was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second not worth the money in my opinion,negative

patton oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance it s because of comedy central mangling the dvd version the show was originally broadcast on comedy central and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one hour time slot with commercials the dvd has the original show and then in the bonus section it has deleted scenes which are the parts of the full length concert that were cut for time so you can watch the time edited show or you can watch the out of context segments that were taken out but what you can t do and what i have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do is see the original full length show in its entirety so cheers for patton boos for cc i won t be buying the dvd and that s why,negative
an exact copy of ang lee s wonderful eat drink man woman frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i d already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i d seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you haven t seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman,negative
as the other reviewers make clear this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ruined her so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation problem is having just watched the movie i am not convinced there is anything below the surface prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy \( as fantasy it is \) is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility not that i can see,negative
dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless,negative
the film seems to focus on 70 s punk exclusively anything post 1980 is glossed over clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this documentary i think the film does well documenting the roots of punk seeing as how letts was steeped in the scene at that time \( although the misfits weren t mentioned which i found odd \) the interviews with henry rollins and jello biafra were great as well however in order to claim to be a documentary the evolution of punk rock is just as integral \( perhaps more so \) as its origins i think basically letts based the film on his own opinions likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk i was disapointed,negative

i was stunned by this movie i learned of it and purchased it in 2003 for various reasons it remains for me the best most emotional movie i have seen about musicians and their music the producer chose well he found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years townes van zandt rodney crowell steve earle guy clark steve young john hiatt charlie daniels and a tribute to the late skinny dennis immortalized in guy clark s la freeway i wish david allen coe had been left out but no film is perfect the songwriters are shown at their best and worst a drunken funny tvz falls into a rabbit hole and silent night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics this movie was made when i was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in tampa at the university of south florida the difference is that most of my friends and i got straight jobs we still tried to make a difference but these musicians changed the world just a little i married the singer business major i met at usf and divorced 30 years later i still play guitar write and record at home and dream of making it in music but mostly i learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me when tvz sang waiting around to die he brought tears to the eyes of his 70 blacksmith neighbor while cindy comforts him it was magical tvz does a medley of my hit and sings pancho and lefty and rodney crowell sang bluebird wine both covered by emmylou steve young s alabama highways was wonderful too it was a look into my past and the past and future of the intelligent emotional music i love best,positive

leather wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper because you know a dvd makes good toilet paper \( maybe it s why he s so grumpy \) i would suggest purchasing it and watching it michael moore may be more to the left than some but god hasn t anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye it s less biased than the news is he reports you decide and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion but weren t michael moore is far more honest than the republican talking heads \( rush coulter hannity \) watch enjoy investigate further,positive
i enjoyed this wholeheartedly mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula instead of mimicking the one time use of the flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around all the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable then every wrestler gets their own match some of which overlap which makes things interesting although we do see some perennial best of favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage who would have guessed sal bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000 s if wwe continues releases with rarer footage i think they ll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase,positive
first of all who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds this is terribly anoying especially when every third shot is of the same audience members this may be fun for a home video but not for a mass marketed commercial release the dance hall crashers are an awesome band much of the fun of seeing the dhc in concert is their highly kinetic stage presence it would have been great if this dvd had concentrated on the band as a whole and not just different extreme closeups switched at a dizzying rate and since the dhc are supposed to be the focus why does the director insist on featuring so many shots of the audience it gets on your nerves i love the dhc their live cd has a permanent place on my playlist but this horribly made dvd only made it through three songs perhaps if i had been at the front of the stage that night i would appreciate it more,negative
the strange and baffling career of cuba gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of denzel s training day unfortunately cuba s not denzel and this movie is way below the quality of day filled with enough foul language to fill the pacific ocean the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie filled with bad cops where s the good ones clifton collins jr so good in capote is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of cuba who is going to testify in internal affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust all though this cuba swaggers like a rap star and collins has to try and act tough with him there s an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film,negative

1 2 when it was released in 1967 guess who s coming to dinner was acclaimed as a breakthrough film for its lighthearted yet serious depiction of an interracial romance in the years since society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so called mixed marriages that any remake is bound to feel at least to some extent superfluous and anachronistic and that is exactly the case with guess who a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the stanley kramer original the screenwriters first alteration involves switching the race roles so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in law rather than the other way around bernie mac assumes the spencer tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a caucasian boyfriend \( ashton kutcher as a white sidney poitier \) home to meet the family on the distaff side we have judith scott taking over for katherine hepburn as the understanding mother and zoe saldana replacing katherine houghton as the freethinking daughter since interracial marriage is no longer the hot button issue it once was the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non race related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama thus we have kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may in fact be the target of a securities and exchange commission probe indeed with kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father in law guess who feels more like a remake of meet the parents than of guess who s coming to dinner the real problem with guess who is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn t pass muster even on a third rate sitcom for every scene that is incisive and daring i e kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table there is another that is pure hollywood hokum \( mac and kutcher sleeping in the same bed together mac and kutcher having a go cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo etc \) all of the performers are fine especially mac and kutcher in the lead roles however they just haven t been given very sophisticated material to work with here guess who might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine hard edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality still it s been 38 years since guess who s coming to dinner first shocked the nation with its in your face defiance of miscegenation laws and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition which is why in the year 2005 brokeback mountain was a breakthrough film and guess who was not,negative
i am from india and megadeth is one of the few metal bands with a huge following here from the few bootlegs of live shows that i did manage to get hold of this seems to be one of the best gigs ever mustaine s singing is as good as it gets live \( if you think it is bad then you have nt heard him elsewhere \) but such minor foibles aside the gig is f in awesome the setlist is almost perfect the biggest pro is that most songs have been improvised i love that i used to hate the fact that megadeth played cd perfect versions of their tracks which was not fun i d rather listen to the cd with better production and singing but here they have really streched quiet a bit and given the audience a stellar musical show jimmy de grasso \( tho he looks a bit nervous in my opinion \) is unbelievaly tight he looks like he is appearing for a test when he s playing the solo on she wolf \( you can see the tension on his face \) but wotta solo the sticks alsmost blur out the sound and picture quality is great too my only grouse is that the band has almost no audience interaction and there s very lil bonus stuff on the cd some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would have rocked they need to learn a thing or two from the tallica guys about this but that apart brilliant gig a must for any metalhead,positive
this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it isn t what a shame it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense buy or rent on your own if you dare i wouldn t,negative

there s nothing you can tell clearly about this movie because from the very beginning to the end i ve just heard lota f words f this f that typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness or if they thought by simply using this big f word and they could kill thy kingdom come then america might not look like what we re seeing now maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what they re just using that word to kill each other or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big f word to talk the talk i don t have any clue man,negative

wow this movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time i watched it last night and i woke up in a bad mood everything about it sucked except for the nudity \( hence the single star \) i understand it was supposed to be something of a comedy but without a touch of reality i found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it the acting is awful the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke michael caine s goofy appearance was accentuated with some ginormous glasses there isn t a teen girl alive who would find that sexy when i saw the blame it on rio reviews on this site i felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than 2 stars \( many gave it 5 \) strangle them then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor,negative
i m not a big fan of bruce campell but i was appalled while viewing this film i know it s a b horror film but there was no orginality in this movie i know it s suppose to be funny but come on people was it really the only part that was slightly funny was when campell s wife was going after the gypsy for the first time needless to say i think it s interesting that this movie was a book going off subject however on a late night talk show bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a pg 13 horror film i ll conform with that,negative
it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment considering the makeup of the cast nicolas cage bridget fonda and rosie perez among others the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the ny state lotto decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day the acting is surprisingly \( \) below average the dialogues are way below average while the plot is not bad at all nicolas cage s character is too naive and too slow and that was just sad pitiful bridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland rosie perez s character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing they don t seem to belong subsequently they are not convincing in their roles at all finally somebody shoot the narrator please though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here if nicolas cage is what you had in mind check out the amazing movies city of angels and or the family man,negative
for me this movie is very different than other holocaust movies in that it explores the issue of what happened to jewish spouses of aryan women the story itself is based on a true occurrence and the movie begins with a wake the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime berlin shows disapproval at her daughter s choice of a non jewish fiance the daughter then discovers there is more to her mother s past than she was ever told and travels to germany to discover her mother s past the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences and basically focusses on the plight of aryan women in berlin whose jewish husbands have been confined in a place called rosenstrasse i won t give too much away but i must say that for a slow paced movie it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the jewish spouses as for the acting the characters from the past did an excellent job their performances were very realistic and heart wrenching especially the actress who plays the main role of mrs fabian fischer the aryan wife in the present day the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother s past wasn t very convincing but all in all the story itself makes up for other lacks in the movie and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot,positive
the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame like bergman s scenes from a marriage fanny alexander von trier s the kingdom fassbinder s berlin alexanderplatz kusturica s underground and petersen s das boot the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers attention on the large screen via a limited art house run unlike these other series kieslowski s was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block \( and characters from one episode may pop up in another \) the stories of the dekalog are morality plays but they are not re enactments of the ten commandments but rather inspired by them and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two kieslowski piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves \( instead of contracting 10 of poland s best up coming director s to do each as was initially planned \) and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories i won t comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them so i will comment on kieslowski s style kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature his films often tackle issues of political import however he intentionally avoids making issue films but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected as he feels that politics solves nothing that films do not really change the political culture his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before during after the solidarity movement initially he started as a documentary film maker but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film making has an impact on the lives of its subjects he switched to his unique fictional style this facets 3 disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2 disc version previously available in that the picture quality is a little better however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series first facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu to add to that you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch after the end of each episode very annoying then the picture quality isn t as good as it could be not only is there evidence of flaws in the film \( scratches and blotches \) but the film isn t a true digital copy of the original series but rather a copy of someone s pal tape of the broadcast so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape the picture is also cropped from the original especially on the bottom the picture at times jitters especially during the ending credits the english subtitles are minimal at times missing dialogue and can not be turned off there are some nice extra features particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub use subtitles instead apparently all of the other \( imported \) editions of the dekalog are of better quality offer more extras than this edition which is inexcusable given the price,negative

filmed at new york s improv in 1971 we see a young pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous more polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album craps after hours however witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother s prostitution then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said this scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come,positive
in this cynical day and age it s truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant \( not to mention amazing \) but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage this film works as a eulogy to arthur killer kane a synopsis of the dolls early years and a buoy for rock n rollers lost at sea it s all things to all people but it s never boring or condescending i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not simply because it s a great story well told and stands up to repeated viewings,positive
we must thank the director and salute sigourney weaver s beautiful performance this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle yet ferocious giant mountains gorillas it is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of rwanda secluded from the world she lost much of her sanity as well as her life in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas without her work who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction thanks to her work and dedication a lost cause had been heard at last the struggle for the survival of the great apes is not totally over though one must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders that happen with or without government officials approval in each country involved and the continuing deforestation and fauna s loss of habitat can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved one must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like diane fossey conservationists around the world and the rwandese people in particular who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures all hope is not lost,positive

wow i just viewed spun the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous this is sort of a guilt pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards spun has an impressive cast of recognized actors the film is essentially about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts there is the cook \( mickey rourke he truly makes this story worth watching \) who makes the drug \( speed \) and sells it to spider mike \( john leguizamo \) a dealer with a junkie girlfriend cookie \( mena suvari looking infinitely less attractive than she did in american beauty \) one of his clients is ross \( jason schwartzman \) who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend nikki \( brittany murphy \) i was surprised at how funny the film was at times it doesn t drown us in anti drug messages nor does it become one of those equally tedious drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party the humour is dark certainly but funny nevertheless a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee patrick fugit who is caught by a couple of tv policemen \( peter stormare and alexis arquette \) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get spider mike i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead this is a film with a lot of energy that seems like its characters not entirely sure where it is going but determined to get there and quickly although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too the director jonas kerlund has directed music videos in the past and it shows in his impatient filming style as he plays around with animation speeded up camerawork and such like i m not recommending the film for its style though although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen i am recommending it because i liked the main characters which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki or spider mike and cookie or even just ross who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours days what makes spun better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community and we feel as if we are watching their everyday speeded up sleepless lives simply amazing,positive
this is one of the best movies starring children i have ever seen ozu embraces their viewpoint often litterally from their eye level often in other ozu films like tokyo story and early summer we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and often times humerous perspective now in good morning we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family like all ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions it is not as masterul as tokyo story of floating weeds but it gives us a better understanding of ozu and how he saw the world very charming film,positive
this series represents the second attempt to revive tz and is vastly inferior to its predecessor the series began with some built in problems particularly the choice of forest whitaker as host narrator mr whitaker is a fine actor but a poor choice to host the series and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes often walking around while delivering his opening lines after watching some of these episodes one can understand forest s discomfort he probably regretted accepting the job another major problem is that this series came out on upn which has never been \( and never will be \) a leader in quality programming although there are some interesting story ideas they usually fall flat in the end it s still a good life is a noteworthy example intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series and featuring original cast members cloris leachman and bill mumy \( with the addition of mumy s daughter liliana \) this episode gets off to a good start but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn leading to a rushed nonsensical and unsatisfying conclusion this sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing this series resembles the original in name only and even the worst of the mid 80 s episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly poorly written lame stories the kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged enjoy it for what it is but as andy taylor once told gomer pyle don t over expect,negative

feeding the cat those girls shold put on a sweater love this movie 50 s detective noir set in 70 s california the beach the hospital mexico the supermarket it s all great and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over final scene pays homage to the third man beautiful a bit of violence but that s how i treat someone i love and i don t even like you never seen an elliot gould movie i like more than this it s my favorite altman as well,positive
quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time clive owen is really cool but not in this movie angelina jolie s polital agenda totally fueled this film what a waste of time,negative
the movie is a piece of art one of my all time favorites the extended edition dvd is very badly compiled the bonus features are sub par with bad video quality the alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film and do not have the bi look and feel other special features are small and without much substance the extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended it is not a director s cut \( the dvd states this upfront in the opening credits \) so it not fun to watch don t get this if you are looking for a lotr style extended edition,negative
i found this movie to be almost unwatchable if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes then this movie is for you the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it altman can pull off such greats as mash and godsford park and then stink up the joint with this what s up with that,negative
this movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage i have ever seen aniston s character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him that is total nonsense i expected them to get back together in the end real people do not behave like this or maybe they do it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country,negative
one of the worst van damme movies of all time this one and derailed and replicant and knock off come of van damme baby make good ones and have good directors too this one has van damme after mickey rourke who rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him then van damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians \( corny \) he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child \( who van damme and rodman almost indanger the poor kid bastards \) van damme gets help from puke and choke rodman and they have awesome adventures and eat lots of candy no wait thats what i was thinking and then no but there s some i said some good action but then it dies and sits there the end with an oiled up shirtless rourke and the tiger lets the suspense and action down strickly for fans of the movies van damme was crappy in this is repuked up snot on a seseame seed bu,negative
this jet li movie is thus far the best movie since shaolin temple as younger jet li its awesome surreal fighting creates this epic feel to the whole genre of martial arts fighting jet li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie it has laughter suspense compassion and innocense the most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the witches pawn this film is highly recommended to those who love jet li and crouching tiger hidden dragon an excellent movie to add to the jet li collection,positive
i think i just don t like pilates because i really didn t care for this workout plus you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you ll have a round hard belly this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes so that s the main reason i just didn t like this video,negative
the dead zone is still one of the best shows on tv and while i agree with some of the other posts the stillson story arc was handled well strangely as for the dvd s the box reads closed captioned as a feature sadly they are not hopefully usa knows about this and will remedy the situation,positive
i was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one star someone even accused them of not being young at heart well i don t like this film and i m young at heart i m just not immature so try not to confuse the two some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing having said that on to the film julie and friends are simply dying to be included in the in crowd their first year of high school so on the night julie has a sleepover they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a scavenger hunt which is basically one huge dare game the group that fulfills the dares first get to be popular by \( drumroll please \) sitting at the popular lunch spot that is a picnic bench by the school fountain that s right popularity is not guaranteed by who you sit with but where you sit pick the right spot and you may just magically become queen bee for the rest of the year in case you couldn t tell by my sarcasm the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times we all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick flicks but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it granted a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film in fact the movie s beginning surprised me with many clever and well written clips however there is such a thing as going too far the movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like well the dumbest scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet not that all the boys are like this mind you there are a few of the god like types that the girls practically kill themselves for it got worse however when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes if the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time it might ve worked instead the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction for example there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says julie i know you can do this i believe in you in a tone which implies that they re talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game the worst serious scene however is when julie attempts to get into a dance \( therefore fulfilling the final dare \) and the ticket seller won t let her in because she doesn t have a ticket suddenly inspired julie gives the ticket seller a sickening i know who you are speech telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now because of her former nerdiness she s become a poor ticket seller julie ends her speech by wailing i can see myself being you in four years if i don t go to this dance the ticket seller leaps to her feet but instead of punching julie suddenly breaks into a smile and says go ahead and go in um what whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity isn t everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans \( not to mention that nice sock in the mouth i was hoping julie would get \) is this what we want to teach our kids that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life i personally think the nerds are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything it was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion i m not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange i recommend never been kissed and mean girls far more than this film they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor oh before i finish here s one more valuable lesson from this film girls if you want to win a guy who s never noticed you all you have to do is strike a cool pose hop on a skateboard and ride it directly in front of his car \( don t forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you re at it \) do this and he will be so in love with you that he won t even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear the things we learn from movies huh,negative
henry fonda leads an all star cast in this great classic when good men do nothing evil prevails watch the drama unfold and see one young man s life on the line one hot and humid room one clock counting the hours twelve men from different backgrounds twelve heated opinions one verdict,positive
this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives not unlike our own but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity it avoids going too far into the subjective it doesn t try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute stagey displays of animal interaction instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments but by the sheer genious of editing and writing one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama the movie wisely lets the animals behavior do the talking and doesn t try to push the viewers judgement one way or the other it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals emotions and the nature of our \( and by our i mean all of god s creatures \) existence,positive
the great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes the plot is easy to follow and all is the action and i think jj abrams did a great job as director this dvd is worth looking,positive
first let me say i love koyaanisqatsi the original film in this trilogy koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth the second film in the trilogy powaqqatsi wasn t as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war instead it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation nothing more if not for philip glass music i would not have given this film any rating at all i write this criticism in hopes that godfrey reggio sees it he should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us as clearly as he did with koy why war \( the topic of naq \) is so horrific if you want an effective critique of violence try clockwork orange naqoyqatsi is simply a mess,negative
sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie but peter sellers did many better films than this dr strangelove was the masterpiece being there is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington the world of henry orient \( at last on dvd \) is priceless but virtually unknown with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors finally the pink panther series is much better slapstick than after the fox which has many famous talented participants but is mostly silly unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau co one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations as if we might not notice them otherwise i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted and martin balsam does okay with his stuff too when watching this film i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money,negative
this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices he hit the time the place and the kids perfectly this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday its a great movie and i d recommend it to anyone you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn t as bad as it sounds plus great script dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950 s over this era,positive
i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i wasn t surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much once he did start playing gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in by the time things settle down the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface the mix is horrible the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the concert experience there are high points in the show but the low points are rock bottom comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart two versions are provided on this dvd from the concert and in the bonus section neither of the guest singers \( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff \) know the words have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience the very best thing on this dvd is oddly enough in the bonus section screamin jay hawkins i put a spell on you a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland almost makes the dvd worth buying almost watch jonathan demme s beautiful treatment of neil young heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show that is the gold standard,negative
the original candyman sucks so bad but everybody praises it and i kept wondering to myself am i missing something so i tried watching it again and it still sucked as i could not even get through it so i figured maybe i should watch the sequels and maybe i would find something that i liked about this series well after watching candyman 2 one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish again the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme the villain in candyman makes me want to laugh because he is so not scary if you want a good laugh watch the candyman series but if you want to be scared you would even do better to watch ren and stimpy in all seriousness watch halloween and halloween ii if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn t try to send a social message lol some people call candyman 2 farewell to the flesh a horror movie i just call it rubbish,negative
this is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor it is also a story of cross cultural misunderstanding of the highest order kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part the scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema the cinematography and editing are a masterpiece unforgettable,positive
another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it s because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen,negative
the latin moves in this workout seem strangely like american aerobics to me you can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves but if you re interested in latin dance my advice is to buy brazilian dance workout with vanessa isaac instead this workout just isn t as energetic and fast paced as it looks,negative
these are great films and the set is lovely but boo to criterion anyhow for not sticking up for cassavetes scholar ray carney whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with cassavetes widow gena rowlands buy the dvd set anyhow you must but go to the cassavetes pages find carney s links and read his account of the troubles he s had trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of faces and shadows he himself tracked down sorry to take sides gena rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does but i greatly admire carney s contributions to keeping cassavetes memory alive and exposing people to his films he put an amazing amount of work into cassavetes on cassavetes too it sucks that he kind of got stiffed here,negative

i used to like my viking 512mb cf card a lot i had such a card for more than a year in that period i used it in my camera it s filled up for several times also occationally i use a card reader \( simpletech \) to write read that card to transfer some big files between computers it s all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading i got cf card error on my camera fortunately after i delete a few pictures i could move on i gave the card to other people so i don t know how it s doing now after that i purchased another viking 512mb half year ago i used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet now i am getting consistent cf card error message on my camera even after re format for several times while i don t have that problem if i use another card one theory i heard was that a card reader may damage a card i can not verify though anyway i will have to buy another card now and it won t be viking for this time one month later i contacted with their customer support they gave me a number for return and i mailed back my damaged cf card they sent back a new one in a week the new one is working fine so far the exchange was not difficult they did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt they only verified the serial number that s good,negative

i bought this for my wife i have an iriver hp120 which i consider to be one of the best ever made i have to say i think this is a great little player the interface is well designed the unit is well made and the sound quality is excellent i purchased a u2 about 1 year ago as a gift which was also excellent i think cowon is making some of the better mp3 players on the market now and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit,positive
this armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen \( stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector \) it works well for jogging and working out the neoprene \( better than leather for sweaty workouts \) armband fits well on my upper arm \( 6 200lb \) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms it is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place i first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so i now just clip it in which seems to work fine it has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but i think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband i have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and i am satisfied at this point i am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included also on another note apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors i have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception the button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly all in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it s a solid value,positive

received the product it was not fully functional the buttons worked but the mouse would not track i loaded the software trouble shot everything even put up with maddeningly insane questions from kensington tech support \( did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in \) however amazon com was very quick and gracious in the return remarking on the design seemed to fit well in my hand though it was a bit bulky usb cord was very long a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly i m a bit disappointed i was always a fan of kensington products starting with the 90s trackball i also have a cordless optical notebook mouse i ve been seeking a replacement b c it chews through batteries like none other so far i am 0 2 on satisfaction with kensington mice,negative
how often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century nobody is moving and you can tell it s going to be a while it would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you re stuck but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation this inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car just like a wall outlet no worries work off your car s alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment,positive
i installed this unit on my hp amd 64 x2 with a 19 inch lcd monitor installation was very straightforward with no problems experienced the unit has two rows of power outlets eight outlets total all are surge protected but only one row has battery backup each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets the unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line and interacts well transparently my dsl service the unit comes with a usb connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer also included is powerchute personal edition software this software replaces the ups option used under the power icon of widow s xp control panel powerchute pe allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user s needs powerchute pe automatically loads at computer startup and resides as an icon on the right side of the window s task bar it monitors the unit s status and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference in order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly i only attached the pc and monitor to the powered row of outlets transformers seem to use a lot of power and to gain the most time available for adequate shut down times they should only be plugged into the surge only outlet row when a c power fails the unit immediately picks up the power load it will then begin to shut down the pc if a c power does not become available shortly the default method it uses is to place the pc into hibernation mode saving the desktop exactly as is for future start up it accomplished this task with my pc perfectly if i had wanted a ups to keep my computer running for several minutes during an a c power outage this is not the unit i would have purchased however to keep my system from re booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily or to shut down the pc safely should the power outage last longer this is a cost effective solution for those tasks,positive

i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it s biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an abc book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use,positive
i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it 4 s and 5 s so i expected a lot out of them the truth is you really shouldn t they don t sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to 30 00 after shipping and stuff the mid highs and highs sound fine but i had issues with bass and mid low response especially when i plugged it into my computer plus they are not super comfortable either the hinges nip at your neck when you don t have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses all in all i wished i had spent my money on something else but they do look pretty cool,negative

this was my second netgear product i bought \( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed \) the idea of a network storage appeals to me but this drive just is not good in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well but that is where everything started to go down hill midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages \( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors \) and suddenly my computer reboots figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot tried again same thing happens started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 you need to look in to your own computer to quote netgears web site scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives many newer computers use promise sata drivers my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers back in the box the sc101 goes and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and none work this is where i get really frustrated netgear support i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i d have to pay to have that cr p yes he said it from my system i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill i have to pay to get this junk off my computer way to support your products netgear the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again i was freaked that this person knew my home address all in all this is a great concept after reading up on it and now experiencing it i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market maybe by a company with better customer service it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer,negative

like the name suggests the m audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first however when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496,positive

we now have three of the k850 printers in use one with a built in print server second paper tray and duplexer so far the printers have proved to be reliable fast and comparatively inexpensive to operate power on pre print and post print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer capable of using the same hp 10 black and hp 11 individual color ink cartridges as well as replacement print heads as the hp business ink jet 1100d and hp business ink jet 1200d the k850 shares the same low per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph white horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads shipped with the new printer are defective the printer handles paper sizes up to 13 x 19 so it easily handles b size \( tabloid 11 x 17 \) paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters the printer software installs without problem although a reboot will likely be required for network capable k850 printers the software install automatically finds k850 printers on the network and adds a hp standard tcp ip port to the computer configuration for communication with the printer for non network capable k850 printers both usb and parallel port connections are supported positives uses ink that is compatible with other printer models helping to keep operating costs down fast printing for full page color and even faster black printing with spot color large format color printing which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced printing stops automatically user replaces ink cartridge and printing continues separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges heads after ink cartridge replacement larger capacity ink cartridges and lower operating cost negatives minimal install of hp software from the cd requires at least 100mb low capacity hp 13 print cartridges ship with the printer power on pre print and post print noise just like the business ink jet 1100d and 1200d however there is very little noise produced while printing cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges similar to that used on the 1200d large footprint,positive
this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment,negative

let me start by saying i was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going i imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up or find them if we got lost \( or god forbid worse \) i bought two from amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the amazon order to arrive i took my girlfriend s niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked five minutes later mine locked up i went and found my niece uncle xxxx why does the screen look all funny the units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up so i exchanged them but then so did the two i got in exchange i thought perhaps i got a bad batch from the local store but when the amazon units arrived they had the same problem we took them out for a stroll with some friends from mba school the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers dude these forget locating the people in your party even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks \( i should know i was so excited when i ordered the radios that i applied immediately for a gmrs license with the fcc \) the rino 530 s simply don t work well a combined gps and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product but at 400 a unit they are pathetic 1600 for four units bought me disappointment frustration trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem frankly the gps is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes you have to stop remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot then it happens all over again a few minutes later the product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity you wind up thinking how great it was when you had 20 radios that worked i spoke with three garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected every seven minutes come on windows 95 was more stable than that finally i got a guy on the phone who said oh yeah there s a problem with the 530 s you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can if not we can send you some more but i can t make any promises he explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the lcd and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution reading the other reviews i d guess they ve been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now and through multiple software releases i am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair i ve certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases \( linksys routers for instance palm treo s \) but this is no 50 router \( or generally stable 400 phone \) and frankly i have to reset my router once every four months at most this product is really bad i wish it were better because the concept is great but i would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache,negative

i struggled between this and the shure e2c i decided on the e2c after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3 this one has the least clarity but wonderful bass if i don t listen to as much classical music i d definitely pick vmoda vibe it makes even terrible pop songs sound cool i had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason and i had an extremely hard time putting it in even with the help of my bf the vmoda did not come with any foam only the silicon ear pieces i settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c,positive

in my opinion i own a ton of panasonic equipment most recently a dvd recorder i was using sony dvd rs with no problems but being a panasonic person i figured panasonic must be better in order to save a few bucks i joined the panasonic club at the panasonic website and ordered a spindle of these same type dvd rs i did this on 9 20 06 i made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were and believe it or not nobody at panasonic could tell me why they hadn t been shipped then i was promised that they did ship but i never got them after being talked into placing a duplicate order by a panasonic rep i didn t get that order either i finally received one order on 10 16 06 they were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken now i finally had my discs guess what they were only 1 8x speed \( the sony discs were 1 16x speed \) and my thermal label printer wouldn t print on them because of the finish i had been assured that i could print on them with a thermal printer i did burn a couple of movies and they worked but i saw nothing special that i can report it gets worse i logged into my panasonic club account and saw two charges i hadn t made one for 10 017 and one for 915 i fell off the back of my chair to this day nobody has called me but i managed to get some email responses and i was told i would have to watch my credit card that s just what i need you know sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a company it is and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were i m going back to sony and let me tell you amazon customer service blows away just about every company i ve dealt with \( sorry about the preposition \) i should have bought on amazon,negative
the amd ahtlon 64 venice processor is great installed into my new gigabyte mb without a hitch and runs very cool that will give up some room for future overclocking overall i would highly recommend the processor by applying for their credit card i received a really low price from amazon which was very surprising about 170 00 with free shipping and no tax everyone else was 200 230 for the same processor it is a great cpu at a good price from amazon,positive
i received this product from an amazon com seller for 1 2 the price of what best buy was selling it for it was new and in an unopened box upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere i had spent over 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd \( directv does not have local hd in my area \) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 reception with it this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94 98 reception depending on the channel \( directional antenna so reception varies slightly \) i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio but i also get locals with over 60 reception from cleveland \( direction antenna is facing \) but also pittsburgh \( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing \) great product and no issues with it so far the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector \( if it has a built in hd tuner \) or tv for best results,positive

i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it 1 5 feet onto a hardwood floor the unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price i wasn t at all surprised when it stopped working the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap the touchscreen is very tedious to customize \( i write software for a living and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen \) i can t imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen unless you are very comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit aside from the touchscreen s fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote did i mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months in short this product is crap i might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less,negative

for this price these are a steal purchased mine for 15 \( with shipping \) and let me tell you it was worth it the headphones come with a 1 4 converter too so you can use them for cd players and amps the sound quality is good and the headphones don t hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours these are an amazing deal for the price i m honestly surprised these arn t marked for 50 don t pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones,positive

when you buy a name like sony you expect to get decent stuff this dvd recorder failed miserably no s video inputs in the rear so you have to run s video to the front panel \( which my 2 year old loved to unplug \) nice editing features if you have the time unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done \( who knows if i will get it back \) i replaced it with a lite on dvd recorder \( at less than half the price \) and am very happy with it,negative

this product has the potential to be tremendous but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches also there is a big rhigo skin logo on the front which makes the case even that more distracting i m sure that it isn t polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail what a letdown p s if you are buying the 30gb version of this case it will double the thickness of your setup,negative
i got this yoke to use with microsoft flight simulator other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke but what did you expect it s just a computer game controller it s not meant to feel like an actual pilot s yoke if it were it would probably be much much more expensive yes the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick but i ve had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems with it also i rarely need to reconfigure it so there s not an issue of wandering from the centre point all in all this yoke is fairly good and works well with flight simulator it certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you re a real pilot but don t expect to feel any g forces or anything else like that,positive
you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same this is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there 1 the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about they are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them these are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way 2 the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front not even standard phono inputs at the back 3 its advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers and in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts \( log relationship \) for some reason this is not even half as loud as my 100 w receiver 4 no user adjustable equalizer only presets possible 5 cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections 6 the receiver sucks even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver i concur with the other reviewer death to sony shame on them for taking consumers for a ride this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it competively with the others meaning fat profit margins,negative
i m not a system analyst so i need really clear instructions for any new device i bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which i could view from the internet at my office troubles i encountered 1 \) set up was impossible i finally figured out that i had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free internet connection i wasn t willing to do this 2 \) i could view from the internet within my home network but not from my office 3 \) had to convince one of my company s it system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera s system took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure which worked until i had to reset my router 2 weeks of use in one year 4 \) i have never been able to have the camera send snap shots to my e mail or ftp folder d link tech support confirmed that i was setting it up correctly but the feature doesn t work i was told by d link tech support that i may need to disable my internet security program no can do 5 \) d link tech support may not have access to this product they are not able to respond to my inquiries they would send me answers but not to the questions i asked 6 \) the weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time i have tried to purchase so i have not been able to install on the outside of my home it therefore must be used inside which is not what i need i could have paid 80 for an indoor camera every so often when i have a few hours to burn i drag it out and try to make the thing work for the couple weeks it was viewable on the internet it provided a nice view of my home but it wasn t useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation,negative
i did my research before purchasing this wireless card from amazon to use in conjunction with my belkin pre n wireless router according to every net review i d read this combination of belkin pre n desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card router in its class and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router range is what i needed above all after some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself i now regularly have connection qualities in the 77 90 range a good 200 300 ft from my router which is in another building entirely \( and both have a lot of metal cladding and what not i had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability \) the odd thing about this pre n combination from belkin is that apparently the later belkin n equipment is grossly inferior and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model these cards and the pre n router are becoming harder to find as they ve been superseded by the newer \( inferior \) models currently in the stores so if you have to operate wireless at great distances i doubt you ll beat these belkin models for at least the immediate future,positive
i almost didn t purchase this cd player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting but i decided to go for it i am glad i did i am very happy with this sony walkman i use it for walking listening to meditating cds audio books everything and have not had one single problem with it i am so glad i did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision as mentioned in another review i love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again it also fits in my back pocket so i can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores the earpieces fit well there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2 3 weeks must not take care of your things i love it the price was great so don t let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase,positive

to my eyes the printer s rendition of colors is above average it isn t horrible but neither is it the best pricewise it s an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature we ve been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via tray 2 \( the default paper supply \) and haven t any problems the manual \( electronic file \) advises never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels so it s a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label a wonderful quality of experience is the near instant on \( very minimal warmup \) feature and it s quiet my previous okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing its time delay was also a disadvantage i think most people will be very happy with the hp,positive
this printer sucks it started out working wonderfully then all of a sudden \( after the third month in use \) it started printing very slowly then it decided it wouldn t print at all unless i completely shut down my computer everytime something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge it also uses the color ink when it s not requested i only needed the color ink a couple of times \( not for pictures \) and it went just as fast as the black i used to love hp they are now making garbage i m thinking of looking at the oki brand don t waste your money on this one,negative

great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that clear easy to read display and instructions menus and interface are self intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it no downloads activations or learning required satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast accuracy is impressive with spot on instructions and updated maps even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand all manufacturers seem to sell them as options \( garmin included \),positive

this is a surprisingly good radio at this price it is small compact and yet very robust and quite heavy it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store here are three things i really liked about this product 1 \) the am fm reception is outstanding i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure 2 \) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function this is something sangean seems to get very well 3 \) the multi level display lighting can be turned off or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright a few things i didn t like the pilot light for on is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night i had to put black electrical tape over it the aux input is a mini jack instead of rca connector minor inconvenience here and finally the cabinet is nice wood but the finish is not as good as i think it could be this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price it s a keeper,positive
i m a fanatic for duplexing since i move a lot of paper around sometimes amounts which i have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds the brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well maybe even the best this particular machine has wireless g built in but it costs over 100 more than the same machine without wireless and for well over 100 you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper maybe even better and for my office wireless is inappropriate \( it also should be stated that if you go outside briother itself then the wireless combo is cost effective brother essentially competes here only with itself \) that said it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone s printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router there are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you it s a complete standalone fax copier if someone in the house doesn t even have any computer at all i m a long time brother customer and they ve made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone there were a few bugs in earlier machines by brother \( comparable but older machines i ve owned like the 8500 and the 9700 \) such as faulty out of toner warnings and all of these seem to have been worked out this machine is clearly out of beta earlier machines were difficult \( though not impossible \) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual and this machine is far better on that aspect as well you can have faxes arrive two sided which doubles your paper tray effectively and you can scan or fax a two sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting this last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease of use you wouldn t use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two sided page unfortunately the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the brothers is the ink aspect unlike some competitors you have to replace a toner and a drum and at differing intervals i assume they do this to keep the costs low but the costs still aren t particularly low the non wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over 400 and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners i don t understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a gas tank you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper but in most instances the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer the brother is a superbly functioning modern machine at a great price but don t imagine the price ends when you buy it this is true of all printers however and the news with most printers is worse than here,positive
let s be honest this product ain t cheap it s not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working i bought mine at cpenusa com delivery was great only took them a couple of days however my c pen cable was damaged the connector to the c pen was for some reason cut in half without it you can t recharge or connect the c pen to the pc i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours no response i sent three e mails to cpenusa no response i don t care if the product itself is great \( i ll never know now will i \) if you re unable to receive support when you need em you re screwed if you re just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and don t really care if you re on your own go ahead and try it let me know how this thing really is otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after sales support,negative
despite careful aiming this has exactly and i mean exactly the same signal strength as my cheapie 6 airlink 7db omni and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap but save your money if you re expecting 15db performance,negative
i got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it the unit is beautifully designed fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small my only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong i live in a tough area for reception and there s slight static on my favorite stations the fm antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit but the reception is still not totally clear that being said i m glad i got it and when my wife s happy i m happy,positive

the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i don t accept having a wireless access point that hangs \( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang \) this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine,negative

i ve had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light so i was happy to find this one however with my first eagle the alarm didn t go off amazon was great about the exchange for a new one \( kudos \) my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won t light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough,negative

this univeral dvd player comes packed very neatly in an oppo cloth case and is very sleek the finish of the dvd player is excellent however the remote is not up to snuff in this department this player can play pal dvds it upconverts it to ntsc 1080i it s loaded with features that you probably won t see on most dvd players out there the upconversion works well though i m not sure the color handling is the best the audio controls in the setup are awesome people have complained about the disc tray being flimsy cheap but i think it s just fine it s very quick to load and play you may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won t be able to control most of the features the hdmi cable that is included with the player is of good quality probably worth around fifty bucks in the market price to performance features you can t beat this universal dvd player buy one and you ll know,positive
the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette mp3 cd and radio capability so didn t have much of an option but to get this one i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality overall i think its a good buy,positive

the best thing about the magellean 3000t is the large screen sometimes this gadget works like a charm other times it just seems to pay no attention actually the touch screen function decides not to work you can sit there and touch rub hammer to no avail i got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to amazon first i called magellan s help line \( the phone number was hard to find \) apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon if you hear a click it s okay finally it works most of the time damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration,negative

i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are user friendly that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons \( sound changing tracks pause etc \) are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and don t fit well i bought a yellow psyc sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is 3 times the product that this one is the sound is near perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i wouldn t write sony off simply b c of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them,negative

for the price i doubt you could do better true there are higer end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance but if all you re after is a significant improvement in the quality of every channel and dvd you watch you can t beat the ads for it s price the biggest flaw is the device s inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my philips plasma set to black out for moments this aside i m very happy with the ads especially it s under 300 price one day maybe i ll upgrade to a unit by dvdo but not until they come don to the sub 500 range,positive
i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me so far it does what it s suppose to do i am pleased it s a little clunky and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended we ll see how it works in 6 months,positive
can t say enough of this machine i view all dvd s in hidef now and that is a beautiful thin,positive
i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner so if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one,negative

this is a great product for those who probably don t write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally,positive
im not a professional keyboard player i bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and guitar pro it suits those needs great its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing the keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard if your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the 100 bucks and get the bigger model,positive
well i got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker then the rear right channel didn t work at all after calling tigerdirect to see about a refund the first customer service rep was rude and unwilling to help said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown ups box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts after getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough the headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn t sound that good at all,negative
i bought these for some sony surround sound speakers although i was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is \( essentially \) plastic however they turned out to be very sturdy and easy to install i also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware well worth the price,positive
i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini \( pink \) is a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge \( no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies \) is about 2 hours apple will gladly sell me a new \( 70 \) battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they re selling shoddy products i m not saying don t buy it there aren t realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i m going to dig out my old discman,negative
i got this card last month and i ve been using it heavily its been great its sturdy and can has great range there are a few problems though 1 there is no case for the card 2 the included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible luckily i had netfront 3 1 3 memory stick lan software will occasionally error but a soft reset will fix it otherwise its a great little expansion card,positive

the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse it loads quickly and it s compact shape offers most options for memory it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet i would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn t move around on my desk so i m giving it only 4 stars if i had to replace this reader i would buy another sandisk,positive

i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office i had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i d get some good listening along with the good looks my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem i was very disapointed,negative

the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case i can t believe the case didn t come this way and that s just the start of the problems the dials are fussy and it s not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case if you haven t cut any slits in it and re tune your station in minneapolis st paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown but that station has howitzer power forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city granted i didn t buy this to listen to fm or shortwave it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that won t happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area that s really difficult to imagine being other radios i own even chintzy giveaway promotional radios can pull in most any station in the metro area if this is an example of grundig s work i d say they rely more on their brand name than their products,negative

got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable don t even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty,positive

pros like a quality piano the keys give a sense of weight the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed the mouse offers great control though i haven t much used all the buttons that are one the form cons the only gotcha is if the computer freezes there is no way to control alt delete also setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts,positive
great joystick i didn t think i could find any better than my sidewinder but i was wrong very configurable and smooth,positive
the only good thing about this product is its price \( i saw it being sold at 160 on some other site \) there are several shortcomings though the greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu there is no home location also there are only two navigation options available shortest time shortest distance so if you are caught in a traffic jam for example there is no detour function also you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa the maps are probably very old i used this device in nj va mn in every state i faced problems multiple times when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead it would not tell me to keep on left right or it would ask me take turns when there were none the unit was very slow in calculating routes \( i dont know how the sirf star iii chip helps \) also it would freeze often i would need to reset it at critical junctions the viamichellin website is only dedicated to europe when i went to register my product i had to register it in viamichellin uk since there was no option for us i dont think they have any support for the us models the pois are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range i returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months it was great on part of amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy \( although they deducted 20 restocking fee \),negative

i ve found the befsx41 \( v2 0 \) to be very problematic with firmware version 1 50 18 some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes bringing down the entire net with the newer firmware version 1 52 10 it fixes this problem but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server \( passthru tcp port 80 \) making the router totally unusable tech support was friendly and helpful and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1 50 18 for our websites and upgrade each time to 1 52 10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking so now we upgrade downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week and each time we do it brings down our net i ve also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands you cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips also it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number even though they map to two different computers this makes it impossible for example to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time,negative
these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity \( 12x \) at 1 4 the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology,negative

the overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic the sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion the pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn t have a very good range \( very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results \) not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of otherwise i would not have purchased the item,negative
for the price these speakers are well worth the cost of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice only bad thing i ll say is that m audio s tech department is really bad emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer \( my inquiry was about a different m audio product \),positive
for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children it s going back,negative

do not buy this system for the money there are much better systems out there i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers the main problem with the system \( which bose has corrected by the way \) is that the acoustimass component \( bose s fancy name for a subwoofer \) is not active \( or powered \) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges the result is that you get a very tinny sound out of most applications including dvd s i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely and the size of the cubes is nice still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system but hey got sucked into the bose marketing machine,negative
this is a great idea a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line unfortunately the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line all in all tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems one wouldn t play the disc one wouldn t eject the disc one had an led readout that would go blank and one had variations on all of these problems the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind but the model cd needs a lot more work,negative
i like many other people that have written reviews here researched the purchase of an mp3 player in great detail other members of my family own ipods and that is the direction that i was heading until i did a massive amount of research if you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on cd this is the unit that you want ipod will not let you download your own songs i did not know that until after i purchased this player \( thankfully \) this unit was the highest rated unit by far that i was able to scour the internet for if this is your first purchase of an mp3 player \( like mine \) buy this one no questions asked do not worry about trying to buy 80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal crisp clear awsome base and i have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40 i cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing i received this player in the mail today at 5 30 when i got home from work and by 6 35 i have transfered the 114 artists folders \( about 4 000 songs \) that i had ripped on my computer last week \( about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player \) i would recomend buying the cradle it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo which i plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool absolutley buy this unit i have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and i have a high performance expectation and it has met it,positive

horrible the gears ingage before the tape is even loaded you have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it s own when the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done you can just hear the damage being done this model destroyed several of my daughters tapes we really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes preserving them also this would be great providing it functioned properly thinking maybe i got a defunct one i had amazon send out another it too functioned in the exact same manner nope mine wasn t bad their all bad this model is disfunctional i ve advised amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly i wish amazon direct had good models to choose from this one is not,negative
i m so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i don t have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them very cool,positive

i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about it must be your computer did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead s movie factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz \( their program \) duh guess what it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads s product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product p s since ads doesn t consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i don t think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is it was packed well ju,negative
i ve owned two of these now the screen s great and i love the wireless headphones terrific for very small children our 2 year old drove to new mexico and back \( well we drove and he watched videos \) with this thing unfortunately both units broke after less than a year of use the first one just stopped working \( with a dvd permanently trapped inside \) the second one just developed an intermittent white out and screen noise that s happening once a minute now so i am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one all of these little players seem to have reliability problems so my main advice to everybody is buy the extended warranty and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles you will be cashing it in,negative
i haven t had any problems using this dvd cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger in fact setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual it was truly plug and play minor quibbles the open close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case and only the lite version of toast 6 is included bottom line i would buy this burner again given my experiences using it,positive
its a good accessory for archos product i have 604 wifi its compatible with generation 4 archos devices pros 1 \) good build 2 \) enough connections to expand cons 1 \) it very much costly as compare to it utility 2 \) it comes with charger which should be a part of standard item 3 \) there could be more cables included in this package like spdif usb mini cable 4 \) in this cost it could have a backup battery \( extra \) that could be part of \( built in \) the docking station so that archos device can have longer play time i think archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can if it is then it would not go a long,negative

just received radio yesterday and am returning radio today pluses adequate lcd display and good illumination while on ac adapter good thumbwheel tuning in 1 khz increments adequate speaker fidelity for small radio however the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 5 6 there is a big noticeable increase in volume \( not good \) and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker also on fm if hands are near the radio the signal breaks up \( for weaker signals not strong ones \) and compared to my grundig 400 pe which i feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome the eton e 5 seems worse still i am returning this today and obtaining the sony 7600gr instead eton e 5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my sony 2010,negative

there are brands i trust and ones i don t sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck,negative
i wanted a simple printer so i could print a few prints from time to time to hand out on sale for 50 this seemed like the right one i already had the included zoombrowser and photo stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a canon a95 camera so i just needed to install the driver note this requires a usb cable \( not included \) to the printer as is human nature i tried to print without reading the zoombrowser instructions and got a lovely plain sky blue print with the words my album on it but no photo \) then out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines this was from a residual click from my first attempt ok ok so i looked at the pdf printing guide for about 15 seconds and followed the instructions got a beautiful first print of the queen mary ship got a gorgeous second print of flags \( red white blue and green \) againt a clear blue sky and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near mt lassen \( ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints \) so i ve blown through the provided trial 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge and have 3 very nice prints \( with postcard address lines stamp area and canon logo on the back the paper comes that way \) the ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1 2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing i can t compare the printing software to any other brand but setting up a plain photo only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices if you want to add backgounds titles text etc that is available as well \( got another pack of paper film and put humorous captions on kind of funny bad office christmas pix \) printing directly from my a95 takes about the same time as from the computer about 1 min 45 sec the actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times \( 3 color passes and a protective layer \) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot the finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front the unit looks and feels substantial for its small size comes well packed \( survived ny to ca shipping \) has decent documentation and a 1 year warranty,positive
i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last after a year or so they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems any scratches that they have only make it worse i recommend using sony fuji or tdk all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don t stand the test of time so if you care about preserving your cds don t use these ones,negative

i bought this premium priced product because it has both built in voice mail and speakerphone the latter was the key feature i sought well it works intermittently just enough so you can tell \( occasionally \) that it s on but infrequently enough that you can t actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation it reminds me of the can you hear me now commercials i d rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well ugh do not buy this product,negative
okay this is not a review of the product itself but i strongly encourage you to consider not getting an n e w warranty they are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things if you had anything to do with the device not working \( e g you dropped it forget about it they aint gonna fix replace it whatever \) they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia \( of course you have to pay for the shipping \) lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n e w warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n e w will take months to pay them for the work they did if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it,negative
this is my second set of garmin radios i have had the 120 s for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530 s first of all i really like the new color screen and the added features the altimeter has been upgraded over the 120 s and seems to be more accurate my old 120 s sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes i would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models we do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top the new compass is also helpful with the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right after calibrating the new compass \( turning in a circle \) it will work just like a regular compass i still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down you can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go the 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can t see your next way point as with all the rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side i really think it s because of the waterproofing that they do if you don t put it close to your mouth when speaking it s really not that bad i did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications lock up problem i have experienced this once or twice the first time i used them i did the garmin update and have not had the problem since overall these new 530 s are great i have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week now that i have 4 of these \( 2 120 s and 2 530 s \) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group looking forward to the ski slopes this winter we always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours if you do a lot of outdoor activities or any geocaching with more than one person these are perfect,positive
if you re an anti commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over if however you don t like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard am fm you might like this tuner many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting hd signals the quality of hd is most amazing on quiet passages in classical music there is no noise at all very quiet you do notice the hdt 1 is quite sensitive it will pull in stations that other tuners won t and i m not even talking about the hd2 streams that the stations are starting to feature clear channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with hd their stations sound good and most of the fm s are doing hd2 a few have some interesting formats not heard on most am fm stations i hope the get even more adventurous my only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get hd to lock in on am or fm i don t believe that to be a fault of the tuner it s the hd system and just like fm did i m sure it will improve \( ask someone over 50 about fm drift \) i give it 5 stars it s not perfect but for the price it s very good and for a first generation product i don t think it could be better than this,positive

i just recently bought a sub woofer and i spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect the interconnects i looked at ranged from ridiculously over priced to questionably cheap i knew i wanted it to be thx certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub woofer placement this interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price i must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound wrong this is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects i do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs but i do not buy into some of the hype surrounding monster cable and their more expensive cables why only 4 and not 5 stars i did not like the way the cable was packaged the cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it i would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable getting past that its a good interconnect that produces great sound,positive
the cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the airport express this comes with a 2 meter rca ministereo a 2 meter optical ministereo and a 6ft power cable i found that both the rca and optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver i wish that the power cable was a little longer and i would ve liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set the installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some,positive

i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2 0 gb compact flash card i like it but the flash card doesn t slide in easily sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they don t i d much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process not a quality reader other than that it works as expected surprisingly the reader doesn t topple over as easily as i thought it would it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in removing the card is extremely easy that s a one handed process eject the card from the pc s drive and then remove it data transfer from the card to pc is very quick overall i m glad to have it but it s an annoyance to use it i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader,negative

i have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is not true i purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids she and i both have newer nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all with hers we can make a connection and following drections carefully we can get it to energize the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality the printer will not pull the paper though properly \( we have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son in law look at it \) i read reviews by others but feel this printer is simply not reliable i wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase in my opinion canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras i m in the process of trying to return it to amazon we re going to buy an hp which i should have done initially thank you,negative

i used to buy those cheap red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets just to have some fun but the batteries didn t last long enough and the beam wasn t bright at all not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round i bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green i thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot but it is much more than i thought it would be the beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day the range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers i love it a much better buy than those crappy red ones and the aaa batteries are easy to replace and last much longer,positive

the material and ergonomics of this phone is average the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience range the range of the phone is very good i can be 80 100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop call quality average i have a plantronics cs50 wireless headset that is on the 900 mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear when i have switched during mid conversation from the handset to headset or vice versa callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call the uniden is much more muffled and less clear it is however comparable to most cordless phone not exceptional but not bad durability average i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn t scratch the hardwood floor special note i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm the base unit will not boot up this appears to have happened to other reviewers this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house on this issue i have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars,negative
i bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn t be happier the phones have the clarity of a corded phone the built in intercom system is perfect the phones allow you to name the handsets as we did \( kitchen basement bedroom etc \) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers they have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in as well as jacks for headset \( though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary one problem with these phones is the batteries in the year that we have had them the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours and we would go through all four phones leave a phone off the charger and in a day it s useless the only solution was to replace the batteries \( which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re programming all the phone numbers \) i recommend the energizer er p240 which is a nickel metal hydride battery and won t develop the ni cad memory effect i love that the base station has a place for 4 aaa batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage,positive
warning this unit has flaws that can render it useless my intention was to share my dvi monitor with my usb keyboard and mouse between my pc and mac simple enough this unit fit the bill according to the specs however as soon as i hooked everything up per the directions the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop i had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about alright 20 minutes googling for support lead me to the conclusion that i needed to perform firmware upgrade warning don t do it attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from xp will most certainly render it a paperweight there is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails and it will under xp when i tried the update i the utility reported tramsit error note the spelling on the word transmit that is how belkin spells it in the utility if they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader what chance is there the code is quality anyway that was the kiss of death the unit was dead and had to be sent back for rma unacceptable i would not recommend this product to anyone it is the worst kvm ever,negative

they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably won t cut the cheese,positive
these batteries last a long time cheaper batteries won t hold a charge after repeated use charging i have aa energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems,positive
there are some things i like about this others i don t some people have written similar reviews but i want to add my 2 cents hope this helps potential buyers likes 1 small easy to use 2 good sound quality 3 good storage capacity for those of us who don t have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers 4 some people have complained that the creative media software is hard to understand i disagree i found it straightforward you can even change the titles artists and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player yes i realize this can also be done in wmp but sometimes you want to edit later or you missed something earlier 5 replaceable battery if it dies you can get another one you don t have to send it in to the company dislikes 1 the shuffle mode is annoying it doesn t go through the entire playlist on shuffle once a song is over it goes right back onto the potential playlist and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played to the exclusion of the other items on the list i want to hear all my songs at least once before i hear repeats 2 the creative media center software doesn t install on windows vista 3 this is a hard drive player so no running with it that s okay though for people like me i don t run it also makes it cheaper than the ipod nano which is a flash player 4 the cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer i don t like this because i m not always around my computer i don t lug it with me everywhere i go however there are ports you can buy \( here on amazon even \) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports so that s handy 5 not as many accessories as the ipod but not that important 6 you can t view your photos while you are listening to music sometimes this sucks but if you have a camera phone or are in an actual conversation with someone you probably won t be listening to your music anyway,positive
i would encourage anyone in the market for a shredder to first identify where the machine is to be placed if you want something cute and compact then keep looking this sb 97cs is a work horse in every sense of the word consequently it may not appeal to one s feminine traits although the size can be a bit formidable for home use it s power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others i was surprised at just how quiet it was the controls are easy to master and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child having had a lessor \( un named \) shredder i knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste paper basket sized machines for less money being one who regularly shreds credit card bait checks and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years this sb 97cs shredder was a must have i doubt that i ll outgrow this machine i ve had this shredder for only a couple of months now and i expect to have it for many years to come it is necessary to oil the cutters after each full basket though if you are the disciplined and conscientious type this is not a problem however i can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don t read instructions,positive

i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i couldn t listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn,negative
the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words 1 you cannot talk on both phones at the same time \( instead you can transfer a call to the other phone \) 2 the range is not great \( though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft \) 3 the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it s a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household,negative
i don t understand the 1 star reviews unless there is some product variability price was 60 at target talk time is ok although the longest i have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes range is fine phone works all over the house and audio quality if fine,positive
i had the tx sr304 everything sounded great however certain times when i played my dvd the onyko produced a loud high pitched ear piercing sound sounds almost like a record scratching the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu when it replays the music theme the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again then making that loud sound everything was great but this one problem made me return this item which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise,negative
i knew better but i did it anyway thinking that it would be a good compromise \( we have ibm dell and toshiba laptops and a sony really nice monitor \) no modem port \( not a surprise but would have been nice \) the video display is well you can see stuff on the monitor one of the usb ports isn t reliable i could go on but you get the picture don t bother,negative

had mine for over half a year now and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day i bought it i fill it and empty it every month rarely ever defragging it back up my pc files and play movies right off it on my laptop throw it in my backpack plug and unplug it all day \( hotswaping \) still with rarely a sign of slowdown and it barely gets from cool to warm ever \( even when its running from inside my backpack \) for some reason requires two usb ports on my new pc \( high speed usb2 0 ports \) when it shouldn t it runs on one port at school just fine and i have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50 success i d buy another one of these in a heartbeat if i ever thought the one i have would run itself out the fact that it doesn t need an external ac adapter to run on my usb1 1 laptop ports \( though it does have a hole for a non included ac adapter \) is a blessing i ve even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd rom drive \( my cd rom ac doesnt work on both sadly \) might be luck of the draw hd related items seem to be sometimes and i ve yet to have to try out their customer service but overall worth every cent spent \( especially since i was looking at a 4gb external for 40 before i saw this \) nearly 1 a gig is a great deal,positive

i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work,negative

we ordered this case auto mount for our philips pet710 7 widescreen portable dvd player because it was the one recommended by amazon i needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler i eventually got this thing to work \( failure was not an option if you get my drift \) but it has a number of drawbacks in order to mount it you have to remove the top half \( huh \) having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose i accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when i drove away it s too small the philips portable dvd player is too long for the case and the headphones and car ac converters also pull the player out of the case plus \( and this is really amazing \) it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the dvd player i have to carry the headphones and sleaved dvds seperately i chose my last dvd player b c it came with an auto mount case and even though i like the philips dvd player i d do that again if i had it to do over having the right case mount for your dvd player is that key,negative
maybe mine was broken but i don t think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends i connected the splitter to my sound card a tb montego ddl with a 1 cable and then tried both a 6 and 30 cable to my stereo no signal whatever both the 6 and 30 cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card i even used only the 6 and 30 cables in case the 1 was bad still no signal i think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter,negative
i purchased this and shipped to us and finally had it delivered to india in gurgaon iam a musician and i desperately wanted a good microphone i record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this but i wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike the gain was lower than the ordinary mike it doesnt work at all without the battery but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who ll entertain me in delhi and i consider 70 bucks down the drain,negative

i ve been a big fan of ms keyboards and mice for years now and the desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment i do love the design and the feel of the keys but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the touch sensitive areas when i don t even touch them \( i type 120 wpm \) in addition the middle mouse button only fires 50 of the time and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision on top of that i began having usb stability problems when i started using their usb bluetooth connector this is with vista x64 i ve already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another and will be returning it for a full refund rumor has it ms is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard oh and there s a bug with the intellitype software that renders the pause play button for media useless in vista guess it s time to look for something else,negative

this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design they don t tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea the portable dvd player is great the tv is horrible when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken don t buy this for the tv we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in this one was a total waste of money,negative

i had owned an lg burner and from the time i got it it never worked right i must have made 60 or 70 coasters before i decided that it was nt the media it was the crappy lg brand burner i was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good but as i found out with my lg experience that is not always true my brother has an older model sony burner and although his is slow it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it so i took a chance and purchased the sony dru 810a that was the best decision i could have made i will never buy another brand burner other that sony brand i have had this burner about 7 or 8 months i am a very heavy burner and i have not made one coaster one thing i loved about my brother s sony burner is that i could use any brand of media the same thing is true of the dru 810a i don t have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is this burner loves everything i had looked at the plextor brand but i did nt want to pay 100 00 and i looked at nec brand liteon benq etc but i am so happy that i passed on them all and got the sony it burns super fast some people say that it is loud but it s not loud to me i got my burner from tiger direct for 50 00 my sister s computer came with a crappy lg brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too so for christmas i am buying her a sony dur 810a so she can finally burn some movies for my money this is the best burner bar none,positive

buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again used to have one years ago now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer,positive
i purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my bose main speakers for my surround sound set up at that time i felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as i listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups i came to realize that the bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par so last year i purchased a polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane the polk speaker which costs the same as the bose \( 199 \) was far and away the better product the sound is cleaner crisper sharper it made watching movies much more enjoyable i couldn t believe what i had been missing out on all these years the only reason i purchased the bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound i have now with polk center and bose main is excellent depending on who you ask the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system if that s true then i wouldn t recommend bose because all you re doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that s a waste of money i know because i made that mistake,negative

good thing first efficient on battery convenient and compact doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge thats it as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony utterly non user friendly i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy i had 1gb of atrac songs on this player from my computer then one day my computer hdd crashed i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me \( a very indifferent group of people \) it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt that it is absolutely infuriating,negative

things that i like \( 1 \) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it but really do like it also this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles \( 2 \) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard even if you don t have windows vista you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs \( 3 \) the keyboard has no lag for me whatsoever \( 4 \) i m a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys etc \( 5 \) this is a small change but i m using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop the software replaced the large volume notifications \( onscreen display showing volume level mute etc \) with a smaller more attractive style notification me gusta \( 6 \) the curved keyboard is also comfortable it requires no time nor effort getting used to it \( 7 \) i haven t had any problems with the keyboard being out of range \( 8 \) for the mouse i m switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3 0 which is also made by microsoft to the laser 6000 mouse included this new mouse is more comfortable \( not a huge difference but noticeable \) it is also lighter and slides around with little effort what i don t like \( 1 \) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click start then log off windows i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down hibernate dialog instead i haven t found that option available so far \( 2 \) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others but i don t find it to be a problem it s just different having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width five stars,positive

this is a great product it was easy to mount and looks great the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees this hasn t caused any problems and i m sure this is well within its design strength highly reccommended,positive
i ve been very pleased with this external drive 500gb my only comments would be that at first the drive was a little hit or miss with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it now it seems to always mount its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive the other thing would be that it could use one more firewire 400 port \( there is only one \) i don t use 800 yet so i need to daisy it off of my smartdisk firelite that happens to have 2 all in all get this drive,positive
this is a great card reader for the price why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have personally i only use compactflash and sd cards it reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably the shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards which you ll want to do a bit carefully it would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the sandisk logo on the card reader it is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first but once you get the feel of it it beccomes quite easy and routine this sandisk has led indicators that are helpful one amber led to tell you the unit is connected to your usb and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert \( solid green \) or that it s reading or writing \( blinking green \) this card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and i feel it represents a good value i would recommend it,positive
we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback i m not sure what everyones problem is it s not a radio tower it s a transmitter the size of your finger i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block,positive
i have been a subscriber for 4 years back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving 3 calls a day for payment i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment payment was made calls stopped for another week the radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm they offered me 3 months of free service to come back anyone who cancels can get this by the way and i refused the 3 calls a day continued for the next week i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system 2 more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that 40 dollars i call in and state i never reactivated my radio thus i don t owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of 2 weeks later i get another bill i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything so then last month i start receiving collections notices you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back this apparently has taken care of the issue though i never received the call back this week i called 6 times 3 of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason and was told each time that it had been resolved so hopefully this time it really is to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp3 player,negative

i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon com but this time as i was listening to my car audio today i was compelled to leave one for others this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp3 player audio system its sound reproducing transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality it does not balance well the low high frequency sounds resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume i think it damaged the speaker and it now sounds like it s going to rip apart someone else left review explaing this trouble which i ignored which was a mistake again don t buy,negative
i just wasted 16 35 on this piece of junk it arrived quickly and became unusable even faster for those of you used to disposable screen covers there is only one in this package the instructions say you can clean it but it came out of the packaging with lint on it which immediately adhered to the sticky side and could not be cleaned off since the package was opened it could not be returned,negative

the headphones sound great no arguement there however i was removing the plastic tips \( which need to be changed every several months \) and the headphones broke the company has only a one year warranty so i was out of luck again i thought the sound was great but for this price i would expect them to be more durable i was hardly touching them when they broke off also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times,negative

this switch works really well i use it between a windows xp and windows 98 operating systems when switching to windows 98 control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly however when switching to the xp os control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds i also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one usb port on the pc it frees up a port using the numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch it also has buttons on the device itself to select which pc to control i rate this product 5 stars when i posted the first time i thought i put 5 stars but i must have accidentally selected 2 i recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price,negative
after going through nearly 6 mouses \( including several of the microsoft mouses \) i settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back it also works with my kvm switch which is a key consideration the buttons are a bit stiff but i expect them to loosen up a bit after some use i highly recommend this mouse,positive

maybe i m bias because i really like yamaha maybe because i have kinda good ears or it s the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub woofer i looked around a long time for the right sub and i like to think i got a good one here you want power ok it s only 250 watts not 1 000 watts like velodyne but in my room \( 30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling \) it rocks i love music all kinds loud or quiet no matter i like both but i do like depth more than volume however i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it and let me say you can feel music if you want to one of the things i love most about this sub is it s range it can \( maybe \) reach 20 hertz 20 hertz that is astounding 20hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear in fact it s starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard maybe i have good ears and maybe i don t but to hear rich airy low end and bass notes yes bass notes bass is not one big boomy lump of noise it s huge open grazing pasture of distinct sounds in short music sounds great even hip hop \( which i don t like \) sounds well better also their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement at very quiet levels too you can hear good clean bass notes but if you do a lot of quite listening we re talking back ground music levels disable the auto on feature and manually turn it on and off because if you happen to be listening to something quiet even if you still can here low notes from this it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto on well on it improves movies as well take something with a lot of dynamics like the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy or sky captain and the world of tomorrow there are a lot of sudden loud and very low sounds in those movie s and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb with most of the controls are on the front set up is and tweaking is made easy and if you are wondering about the bass button if the button is in the music position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the movie position \( i think music is a flatter frequency response \) as this review seems to be getting a bit long i ll some it up yes there are far better subwoofers out there \( like from b w \) but i don t have the money for those and if someone gave me a 1 000 watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat but i wouldn t want to give this one up too it s a absolute pleasure to listen to update i have run some test tones on this subwoofer and well it can not reach 20hz 38hz seems to be the limit for usable bass although it is still audible to around 32hz 20hz is a stretch if 38hz sounds to high their are not many movie s or cd s that have any sounds below 35hz and very very few have sound below 25hz although it does not go as low as i would have hoped it is still a good sub for the money and still worth a five star review,positive

i do not think suction cup mounts work very well this one is no exception while attaching and detaching my garmin nuvii is easy enough the cup does not support the weight i was disappointed that a friction bag was not available for my nuvii however i was able to jury rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise i ordered the friction mount removed the screws on the bottom detaching the mounts that would not fit my nuvii and stapled velcro strips purchased at walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount i have been cross country using this system and it works the garmin portable friction mount for gps 010 10306 00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself,negative

i was very excited to get my hands on this book i have been ordering this series from amazon co as they are released as i can get them several months ahead on their american counter parts i must say that i was disappointed with the beginning of the book first hem is not the character that i wanted to read about second the start is slow and the plot drags a little but all is forgiven after 100 pages i warmed up to hem i actually think that the authors writting style has improved each book and this book just feels right i was done reading way before i wanted to be done the ending is nothing but action i put the book down entertained and wanting more what else can you ask for in a work of fictio,positive
i found stale recounting of very well known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics with no insights since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors and it s only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface i wasn t expecting historical depth but i was expecting at least one fresh idea i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg \( about technology in the economy of the 19th century \) i was disappointed i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower college freshmen born in the 1980s i ll bet they find it kinda stodgy,negative

the author tries to bring both the biography of walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither it is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time but after reading the title and reviews i was hoping for a detailed biography of walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers instead it is a general overview of walsingham s life with references to the work that he did there are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of elizabeth i if you want details and a better understanding of walsingham the man and his life work and actions you will need to look elsewhere,negative
the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition s cover however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen with just twenty pages my seven year old breezed through the book in six minutes the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria i ve made some cookies for tea said ma the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma s by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail the final arrival for this story is grandma with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child s grandma s cookies there are roughly two to four sentences on each page the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this,negative

i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion while it was unique it was too hard to get into i also really hated the story it was also too confusing to follow to strange to enjoy and to boring to care i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club the reivews by the way in the club were 50 50 some loved it the rest of us hated it there was no in between i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors i m not sure who else would like it,negative
i m in love with the impressionists in general and with auguste renoir in particular his palette is full of light soft pink greens and blues are a joy to watch time and again as most impressionists renoir paint wonderful every day scenes mainly outside as his magnificent the luncheon of the boating party \( 1881 \) the swing \( 1876 \) and le moulin de la galette \( 1876 \) whose careful reproductions are shown here he was an artist that loved life and wanted to reflect it as he perceived full of little moments of simple joy and relax he was also a masterful portrayer as you may see from his on the terrace \( 1881 \) in the cover of this book or two girls in black \( 1881 \) another subject that attracted his fancy was the dancing couple which he depicts with tenderness and accuracy it doesn t matter if the dancers are from the high class as in city dance or commoners as in dance at bougival both from 1883 at the end of his life his paintings evolve and produce for our delight seated bather \( 1914 \) and the nymphs \( 1918 \) his life and works are described and commented by the author with keen penetration and endearment reproductions are awesome and do justice to the artist do not miss this book reviewed by max yofre,positive

the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again i was disappointed soon after when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle and then even that was disappointing i mean graceland for a first date i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights and logan and nate from that same book none of them can talk in complete sentences and stella who comes across as this loving mother who puts her kids before anything else works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn t there to oversee everything even though the place has been successful for years there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband she just does it unless of course it was in the last 50 pages which i didn t bother to read because i just couldn t torture myself any longer and i m a big fan of roberts i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be i m certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out,negative

i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail it just doesn t click for me i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self,negative

tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other get caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society s responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother,positive

if you are looking for a feel good book about baby boomer retirement this book may have some value for you but if you are looking for specific in depth how to this book isn t the answer each segment work dreams travel is short and doesn t address many relevant issues for example regarding the work chapter the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap well that is speculative with globalism those jobs may be outsourced most are low paying many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining yes there may be wal mart jobs but is this your retirement dream the work chapter sounds a lot like most do what you love books but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner,negative
many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 or phil gramm s problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read,negative

almost everyone you meet is having trouble with a relationship this book by charles swindoll is a wonderful tool to assist people to build better relationships from my own person experience i have come to conclude that the larger part of relationship problems are caused by lack of communacation in this book charles talks about how to be open in a relationship and the value of trust not only in a personal relationship but also in the church a wonderful must read,positive
this book is pure fiction nothing more the problem is that is presented as fact albeit little known fact i won t repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book it makes for difficult reading it really is not worth the effort as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end in fact if you are a historian or scholar stay away from it,negative
these are all short stories some very short that s what he wrote i remember reading a number of these \( the science fiction ones mostly \) in translation years ago rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting as a collection of all his fictions some of the items are a bit repetitive the variations on the knife fight theme for instance but the range of his imagination is fascinating particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity a lot of it presages the information based world of today which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind perhaps the link to the internet is one reason borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles is not the web exactly borges book of sand a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information but when we turn to find them again we never can and how long will it be before an imagined orbis tertius engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on \( one might suggest it s already happened look up tatooine for instance \) what exactly is information when it s just a bunch of ones and zeros everything s already been written in the library of babel after all the other fascinating thread to me was the influence of arabic and muslim themes i d never caught that before but this collection includes a number of stories with an arab perspective perhaps this is a well known part of spanish heritage in any case it was certainly interesting getting to know borges through this collection from the knife fights to the arabian courts to the immortals not everything was great but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with,positive

one good knight \( 2006 \) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series following the fairy godmother in the previous volume alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician after the death of the katschei alexander and elena were wedded becoming godmother and consort then an order of champions was established at glass mountain with alexander as their master and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms in this novel princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old but is still considered a child by her mother queen cassiopeia and chief advisor solon adacritus she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor after that her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry and assigns a steward to handle her affairs andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard she reports this matter to her mother afterward andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature as it comes toward her she recognizes that it is a dragon then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon it flames some high architectural features grabs a couple of animals and flies away the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen s advisors is very lively andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons consisting mainly of myths and legends and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens the ensuing discussion is even livelier mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down a lottery is organized some women find ways to disqualify themselves but others are taken by the dragon rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice but then andromeda is selected this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms andromeda s knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon but the good knight doesn t come forward as expected someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors however andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance they travel cross country in the same direction that the dragon had flown stopping for supplies here and there and finally enter the wyrding lands they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems andromeda is nineteen and naive then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues does her mother love her while many events occur in this plot this one issue is the crux of the story even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure betrayal and romance arthur w jordi,positive

i did a fast skimming through this book and noticed that for an essential monster movie guide it certainly doesn t praise or hype the genre that well this book comes across like it was written by an elitist who s too good for horror nearly every movie special gets a low rating and i can t understand why a book like this that could ve been a good companion to the horror fan would be so anti horror as a whole horror fans in general want to be be entertained and or scared i for one don t want logical stories and things that make sense if it detracts from the entertainment factor because typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is boring it gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like vincent price christopher lee peter cushing lon chaney boris karloff etc but for a horror movie book the writers certainly didn t help their genre by bad mouthing it so much in this book,negative

this book reveiw is on a book named last summer with maizon this book is about two best friends named margarate and maizon who lives on madison street her friend maizon was accepted to blue hills a school where really educated people go margarate does not want them to be separated every night she wishes maizon will not get accepted but when margarate s father has a second heart attack he dies and now all margarate has is maizon her mother her little brother jay and the people around margarete was having a rough time anyway and then maizon got accepted to blue hills when it was time for maizon to leave margarate her mother and maizon s grandmother dropped her off when maizon wasn t there with margarate her whole life changed at school she was becoming popular she was liked now days passed by and maizon still didn t call when margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house that s when maizon calls margarate was so excited that maizon wanted to come home margarate ran to the grandmother s house telling her the news margarate said maizon wants to come home the grandmother says that she would go get her when maizon got home it was like old times they ran into each others arms they then went to their favorite spot and started talking maizon said she came back because she wasn t being treated right she didn t feel the same so they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend maizon i think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars this book has mostly everything of real life it deals with best friends for example like my friendship with kiena it has separation like my sister and me it has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson i think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life i like this book because it reminds me of my life me and my friends how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking it reminds me of how i lose people in my family and then cry because i miss them if i could buy this book i would let my whole family read it i would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do this book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it it is so good that i really read it because i don t really read books and when i read the book it made me think of when my best friend ariel was going to move and how it made me feel and how i compare it to margarate and maizon this book is excellent the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend if you ask my best friend johnniece she ll say that she really enjoyed the book that it should get five stars because the author really put thought confidence respect love care and her whole heart into this book when i say she put confidence in this book i meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit the author thought about the words thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion i think that this book should be the book of the month in my school because it shows and teaches a lesson with the summary i wrote i put my heart in it because when i read it it touched my heart i won t want my friend away from me i think that i mostly relate to maizon because when she left margarte was beginning to be liked and the girl was talking about maizon and margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend i relate to maizon i relate to her because if people don t like me i don t care if people want me out of somewhere then i ll leave and if people love me i love them back and that s how maizon is she doesn t take junk alot of people relate to maizon this book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on this book is really a good book that shows you friendship break up and everything else that deals with real life i love this book it is really good and i think that if most people had this book then they wouldn t be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing this book really didn t grasp dr kings dream because when maizon went to blue hills the whites were treating her bad they saw her different brenliniqua class 7 512,positive

yes ben witherington is a \( relative \) conservative but don t hold that against him yes he has strong opinions but don t hold that against him either because they are well argued the fact remains that this is the best overview of third quest jesus scholarship i have been able to find admirers of the jesus seminar may not appreciate his critique but it is very fair and well thought out one of the benefits from a book like this besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research is that the different views of jesus can help one achieve a well rounded portrait of the savior no one scholar gets it right all the time \( not even witherington with his own view of jesus as god s wisdom \) but the different insights are valuable because jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend that should be a cause for humility \( something some jesus scholars have lacked at least in print \) i highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary jesus scholarship,positive

charles h kahn s account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion although less than 200 pages long is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality in a concise but intelligent summary kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn s treatment \( or lack of \) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought but this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language,positive

this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework writing a book is no small feat and technical books are a special beast with that last statement in mind this is were the book sadly falls short for one the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books code the authors explain \( on the publisher site \) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print while improvement is always good this presents two problems 1 the sample application is now out of sync with the material not a good thing for those trying to learn as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book also and this is not to disparage the authors skill but i buy books because i am expecting experienced if not expert advice if a small sample application needs rewriting perhaps they should write about something else further down this road the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling i suspect that the final build file was not tested or it was a case of well it compiles on my machine there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled thankfully i use eclipse and imported the project eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive examples are jakarta commons collections and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access for an experienced developer familiar with ant and a good ide it was not a lot of trouble to get it running it just did not give me a good impression bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql first no matter what db you swap in you ll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file i made property variables which i placed in build properties then you will need to change the class user to something else \( and of course anything in the app that references it \) another great reason to use eclipse why you must change it is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you can t name a table user,negative
i m writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing gcc members reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting the oil states today face tremendous challenges as oil revenues start to decline few expected that the decline would come so soon everybody knew it would come but it was expected later rather than sooner this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time worth a look if you re interested in the field,positive

this book consists of 29 stand alone essays beautifully written and previously published in the new england journal of medicine during the early seventies from the first chapter the viruses instead of being single minded agents of disease and death now begin to look more like mobile genes we live in a dancing matrix of viruses they dart rather like bees from organism to organism from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again and into the sea tugging along pieces of this genome strings of genes from that transplanting grafts of dna passing around heredity as though at a great party although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates 1 there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things 2 there is constant reference to the interaction symbiosis and co operative living arrangements amongst the different species 3 there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants bees and termites whose activities create sophisticated developed projects without any evidence of central control these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities with the human emphasis being on language 4 the cell is the unit of life complete with all its intricate inner workings the cell membrane \( cell wall in plants \) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible in the first chapter and frequently throughout the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism but he can t make it work too big too complex too many working parts without visible connections then in the last chapter a better analogy emerges the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan richard feynman and stephen jay gould reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about amazingly after 30 years there is a little but not much in this book that is out of date if you are a little rusty on biology have your oxford dictionary of science handy first class,positive

this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 000 years across the continents diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali yali s question was why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea but we black people had little cargo of our own reading the book i think i gulped at this point this sounds like a classic loaded question it sounds disturbingly close to why have we \( europe and its former colonies \) succeeded where they have failed diamond does not descend into that territory though but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely there are references to a culture s success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing for instance the advantages of a hunting gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia this history can probably be described \( or perhaps is most successful \) as based around environmental causation \( as opposed to the racial ethnic social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing \) descriptions of climate \( note that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age \) longitudinal or latitudinal axes elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity still it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title guns europe s refinement of this technology was based on china s innovations with gunpowder today s dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated as an interesting counterpoint japan had owned more and better guns in c 1600 ce than any country in the world samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology japan wouldn t resume manufacture until mid 19th century obviously there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry s influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today germs epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn t survive smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals \( and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate \) interesting note the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease \( likely smallpox \) rather than guns steel technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities a hunter gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things first there appears to need to be sustainable farming many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region \( where today we invade suck oil and force the conquered to endure freedom \) the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop as a complete side note the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself compared to africa and the americas eurasia is mainly west east axis versus north south movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal something like corn \( maize \) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography llamas and guinea pigs \( which could be useful for pack animals and food \) never made it north conversely all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle horses pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe to answer yali s question some of the answer is luck africa australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had some other is environmental determinism where you are helps make up who you become for going forward diamond cites transportation communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future after word harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up but not as fully developed here that of pre clovis native american discoveries \( pronouncements \) knowingly confronting a loaded racial ethnocentric question in a folio called might white of you are american archaeologists white supremacists the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000 11000 bce there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive one wonders if the pre clovis discovery \(

so many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife s little belly and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever this book describes to a t how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process and it does it in a way that is bust a gut funny before i read this book i was like what the heck is wrong with my wife after reading this book i was more like ohhh i know why she just ripped my head off she hates the smell of carrots great book fast and fun read a must read for a new dad i ve bought it for every father to be and they in turn have done the same,positive
i did not like the book adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters i also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father i shall bla bla bla,negative

if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer this book will provide lots of information it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog but for my taste i found the photographic results to be uninspiring too much posing too much portraiture lighting not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is,negative
this is the worst book of shakespeare criticism i have ever read bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next it reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly handed to a graduate student and entered into a computer over a weekend he contradicts himself several times i donated my copy to the library as soon as i was done reading it so i cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur but several times i recall reading a passage where bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier to make matters worse he even says the bard contradicts himself he points to supposed paradoxes regarding hamlet s age stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30 apparently the point is that if shakespeare contradicts himself so can bloom bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that hamlet is a slacker he has not grown up yet that is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom some of the book s observations are interesting but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from bloom s notes interespersed between the passages scribbled down from bloom s lectures are outbursts where bloom reminds us that shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer in verse or prose who ever lived bloom is a great critic when he still tries but in this book he was not even trying,negative

alliterative analogies assertively assembled appear aplenty appropriately apt and artful absorbing attention ad infinitum this could be a fitting summary of abish s stunningly now novel written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between kabbala and alliteration chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter a chapter 2 with a and b and so on until chapter 27 when z first then chapter by chapter all other letters are progressively subtracted in spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary they may have been culled from today s headlines polysexually inclined thugs hide in africa after a crime spree with the author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them chasing after the thugs from country to country we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite war and genocide corrupted burocrats and soldiers rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air where sparsely assembled people wollow in african indolence all is narrated with poetic detachment in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality it is just that the words were limited by my artifice reader the author seems to smile no harm intended perhaps the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974 to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy great art when unhindered relates to the whole of time in all tenses while amusing abish has managed a ponderous read which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add subtract letter scheme and wonder was it accidental in order to be perfect all i lack is a defect goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet,positive

this is just another attack by organized medicine on alternative treatments and therapies in particular chiropractic dr rosenfeld comes across as biased ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides his assertion that he loves chiropractors is disingenous at best he prefers non specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe \( toxic \) drugs he lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare occuring one in many millions and suggests that these are common occurances he fails to mention that the practice of \( allopathic \) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in the united states which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called alternatives if you want good advice start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors especially this one,negative
though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii there are some great ones to pick from for instance for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i try the doughboys by gary mead for a good look at the events of gallipoli just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne the list goes on and on whether it be flanders the somme passchendaele africa jutland whatever your area of interest might be the point i m making is there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i and even several overviews of the war but john keegan s the first world war is a great source for an overall study of the war this book covers it all in brief detail accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here i ve never been a big fan of keegan his writing to me is a struggle at times this book is no exception it reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and borders on tedious at times but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style he is a virtual historical genius his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted and he writes for the most part without imparting his own commentary in fact without prior knowledge one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself british the big exception to that is keegan s typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues in this aspect he even contradicts himself in several places he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of 1918 germany was still very much capable of winning the war the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front the new soldiers from the east brought with them battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph as they had in the east he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how though ambitious and courageous the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war when he does acknowledge american victory it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces that said if you re seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months this book will infuriate you however if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole this is one of the best out there i should add the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study monty rainey,positive

we have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science math and technological education for everyone the first one occurred after the sputnik fiasco when the russians beat us in the race to reach space the concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the american association for the advancement of science and educators saw in comparison of assessments made of students in the u s and those in other developed countries such as japan the answer to this concern was for the aaas along with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific literacy and what the public in the u s should at least know to be scientifically literate as usual though the aaas addressed the fact that certain groups in the u s were not being included in the pursuit of science literacy such as women and racial minorities in this their first book they skipped over those of us with disabilities since this is a major concern of mine and the area in which i do research i was appalled to see they neglected us once again especially as the aaas has a separate department dealing with the disabled deaf in spite of this mistake the writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that our country can be more scientifically literate with new information being made available through newspapers and the internet on a daily basis it is absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race gender or ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care decisions on employment \( since health care is one of the top employers in the u s today \) and to teach their children this book was the beginning but it isn t the end more books have further elucidated what is required for science literacy from both the aaas and other science groups this is the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their students to become scientifically literate karen sadler science education university of pittsburgh klsst23 pitt ed,positive

the above is an actual quote from the book i don t usually read romances but got this one at the library i thought thriller hijacked plane navy seal all the right stuff and the beginning was promising stan fixes everything and has a human side to him that was compelling then the plot hit the fan as a thriller it stunk the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly as an after thought the romantic tension between the protagonists was forced and irritating the dialogue is mundane the message that horniness leads to true romantic \( sam and alyssa \) love is rubbish the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed the historic \( wwii \) componant was interesting but overall i kept asking who the audience is for this book not lovers of thrillers like me and i wonder do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him,negative

this book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than i am but while i was reading i kept asking myself when s he going to get to the point the first part of the book is all about why it s good to be rich something i thought was unnecessary the bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle class and poor finally in the last part of the book he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy this was the only part of the book i was interested in to me it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30 page book on investing and so kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with fluff however even his advice is considered questionable by many experts i would say that the main idea i got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd i just wish i hadn t invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise,negative
even if somehow bin laden did pick up this book and for some reason decide to read it he would not stick with it to learn the lesson that his victims are real average struggling people the fictional letter diary to bin laden from the mother of a fictional attack victim from an arsenal chelsea soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring bin laden would give it away before learning what the author wants him to the mother just waffles on and on and on and on and on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in any paragraph if bin laden is ever captured maybe force him to read this as torture or something also why does chris cleve chose to glorify bin ladden by crediting him with a new attack when lets face it he hasn t achieved much since september 11 2001 other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave somewhere this book would have been more realistic and made more sense as a letter to the ira hezbollah hamas islamic jihad or one of the current more frequently operating groups alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional character on one of the planes or in the world trade centre a good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank extremely boring,negative

i was intrigued by the title which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity well after 60 pages or so i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life but i say that any religious life \( be it christian islam or otherwise \) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional i am convinced that yoda is a zen master the force is derived from tao not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion \( i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism which is another beast altogether \) a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is the dharma of star wars,negative

this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family s experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder s work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride doesn t manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction,negative

i like evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible the stephanie plum and joe morelli relationship sustained through 12 books so far being a case in point but full scoop was actually a trial to get through i could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted evanovich s comedic rhythm the whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what i have come to expect from evanovich the silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened the least forgivable of the sins committed in full scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between maggie and zack none at all so it s hard to label the book a sort of but not really romance an almost but not much of a woman in danger maybe a new genre altogether the slapstick thriller,negative

i loved this book the food was really good and fast \( which is good because i have a very packed schedule \) also great if you re on a budget the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants the only reason it didn t get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy \( i m from texas i like spicy \) to the point my boyfriend couldn t eat it i just modified the recipes and everything was fine,positive
typee is based on melville s experiences when as a young man of 22 he jumped ship from an american whaling vessel on the island of nukuheva in the marquesas islands of the south pacific it is written in a straightforward narrative manner but it is a work of fiction not a journalistic report something that is often overlooked while like moby dick it contains lots of factual details mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface for a first novel written when melville was only 27 years old the narrative power is quite impressive as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the valley of the typee in the early chapters themes of peace beauty and sensuality are combined with melville s righteous indignation at the activities of western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise gradually dread loneliness horror and fear of annihilation come to the fore as tommo the protagonist becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast he is finally rescued almost by chance and because of conflict among the typees i read the oxford world s classics paperback edition which has an introduction by ruth blair an australian professor of english it was very helpful with melville s historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context the chapter on typee in studies in classic american literature by d h lawrence adds a further depth of understanding newton arvin s biography of melville helps to place typee in the development of melville as a writer highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century american romanticism with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of moby dick,positive
one tiresome heavy handed simile after another agonizing descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action simplistic trite phrasing and dialogue characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat routine characterization a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable proofreading errors fragmented poor sentence structure this book is amateurish writing all the way around i cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received i cannot understand the lack of proper editing i am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm so imagine my disappointment when i was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the prologue in fairness to the author \( and with a hopeful attitude \) i forced myself through the first 70 or so pages however with each turning page i found myself reading along just for sport my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous \( and annoyed \) with this juvenile effort what could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time,negative
i picked up the audio book from the library and didn t know by the title and author s name \( my first jance book \) that this was chick lit i don t feel this book was something i would ve started had i known it started real well and ms jance knows how to reel you in with her writing midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor and then about her friend who died of als and then came the long responses to the blogs it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could ve been a decent suspense drama,negative

first the story takes place in the 1940s \( harold s brother is mia in wwii not in vietnam as the amazon com review erroneously states \) second the writing is superb mr lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel his characters are very real his setting \( a small struggling circus traveling the western u s \) is historically believable peopled with freaks who suffer as sideshows unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with but peopled also with normals who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks harold the 14 year old albino central character tries to straddle both groups of people he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer i am admittedly ignorant about such things but mr lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants crucial to the plot of the novel seem believable my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end i do want you to read this book so i will try not to give anything away here but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character s last words and even gomer pyle like \( people actuallly say gosh \) this did detract from the impact of the death unfortunately but i still very strongly recommend this book five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot,positive

i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour races religions nationality and creed \( all women are equal in my eyes nigel \) in this remarkable novel sk makes his debut an unlikely but good book it has a good dose of horror suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read it is simply about a teenager from maine named carietta white \( carrie \) from the beginning of the story we see who her mother \( margaret white \) takes advantage of her making her feel stupid and left out similiarly in school carrie is always the black sheep she has not friends and she is always picked upon she is very unusual and strange at least to most people especially the ones in the book \( story \) \( but i would say quite frankly that i didn t see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl \) at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her this is her first big humiliation \( i am a guy i know not much about a period so please forgive my use of the term openly \) anyway back to the plot carrie soon realizes that she is psychic she starts to practice using her powers gradually it seems as though she had the powers since birth but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it so so far we see this a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end allow me it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic carrie s mother explains alot of things but she is still a bad mother \( but i still can t hate carries s mother because most mothers are sort of protective over their children \) soon carrie gets her first friend sue sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom this date is tommy ross meanwhile one of the bad girls chris is unable to attend the prom so she sets up a nasty revenge against carrie believe me when i tell you chris is a very jealous girl and if she can t have something no one else can especially carrie so chris arranges a trap for carrie \( two buckets of pig blood \) she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie s and tommy s head while at the prom the plan eventually succeeds tommy is badly injured drenched in pig s blood carrie is laughed at for the last time she runs out of the building she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge she starts to close all the doors she then turns on all the water sprinklers wetting everyone but with a combination of water and electricity \( from the appliances \) some were electrocuted eventually a fire gets started and things start to burn she walks toward her home burning everything within a certain radius of her powers when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her telling her that she is the spawn of satan she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers heart beat killing her eventually \( this is the good part of the book \) while carrie is walking on the streets \( going i don t know where \) she seens chris and chris s boyfriend driving towards her to bounce her carrie uses her powers to diverge to car killing chris and her stupid boyfriend sue eventually catches up with carrie carrie doesn t kill her because she realizes that it wasn t sue s falt but chris s \( during the battle with her mother carrie was stabbed i forgot to mention it sorry \) so now talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just dies \( this is the sad part i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes or maybe not \) but this book is definitely good i recommend it with all my psychic powers enjoy this review was written by nigel,positive
i was reading about my son it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense really talked about a framework of letting the decision making \( and the consequence of their decision \) remain with the teen then half way the book screeched in a new direction all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view when it comes to sex the authors don t want you to leave the decision with the teens they want to take that one back which weakens the premise they present the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position which i would have respected if not agreed with then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the conversation solution if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system i wouldn t have spent the 22 i would have wanted to know that in advance tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book buyer bewar,negative

the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i don t know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over 2 years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children s librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying,negative

i am a chemistry major and so i really like this book however when i initially started o chem i did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook so i suggest to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at hornback or mcmurry the text isnt an advanced textbook perse \( after a good grounding in the basics for three days i found this book quite user friendly \) its organization is completely different to most other o chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity an examples is that when introducing orbitals and orbital interaction greeves et al quickly go to homo and lumo based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding wade and mcmurry leave this one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later a second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals lone pairs and charge these are the things used to identify em as such the book isnt fragmented each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry chapters are well referenced so if say you are only interested in nmr then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding most textbooks act like a stupid monologue miss a passage and you d completely miss organic chem the chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept \( i e jacobs \) however the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors for individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry i would suggest you look elsewhere a substitute \( a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry \) is hornback s which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry,positive

this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco an informer and sleuth a series of books that have become hugely popular so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements that would be and should be found in rome in ad70 but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather well the weather is best left to its own devices marcus has lost his heart to senator s daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated why is that women he is not interested in fall over themselves to get to him but the one that he has lost his heart to treats him with a cool disdain he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book falco is not happy it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way will falco ever return,positive

it s fascinating to compare my own experiences having lived now 3 years in germany to those of an american from 125 years earlier i ve been learning to speak german and his appendix on the awful german language was hilarious in poking fun at german grammar \( e g long sentences \) he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing the scene riding the glacier down the alps was so funny i had tears running down my face it s amazing to think that it was written in 1879 when america was barely a century old and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly eerily similar to either my or typical american s attitudes today i d recommend it to anyone but particularly to anyone visiting or living in europe it s way funnier than his innocents abroad which is also a good read on travel in europe,positive
this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u s administrations in that sense it is the story of two cities miami and washington and two peoples americans and cubans i have an objection though with the stone hard style in which this volume is so meticulously even gorgeously at times written didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and worse the result is a cold humorless colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup the author in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end readers it is in that sense a boring little disaster of a book,negative
as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes deficiencies in the book and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about for instance the claim on page 86 that \( cdata \) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong his description of schema element declarations \( pp 114 115 \) teaches that using globals refs is the only way to define complex elements and is inappropriate for his example he makes no mention of globals at all leaving the reader confused i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information,negative

this book was required reading for a class on children s literature so naturally i was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there the beginning was quite exceptional i even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening we were about 75 of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character s female body parts due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children s literature we set the book down and did not finish it if you are looking for good children s literature that completely steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going then this book will be a let down sad because up until that point the writing was quite good,negative

i recently finished reading this book this is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour it would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself while i am not qualified to comment on these reviews one thing i can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it a theory that too developed quarter century ago can not be expected to stand 100 vindicated today the more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to so may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things after reading this book i could find out why i behave the way i behave mostof the times to a certain extent i learnt to control my responses also i have a feeling that the claims made by dr harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge then prevalent second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people i think this conclusion is far from correct dr harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to i am not ok and you are ok category out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual the objective here is not to merely categorize but to show that how most of us have the common position i am not ok and you are ok now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses third critisism on this book stems from the fact dr harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100 it seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100 with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon i don t think dr harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100 the books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals \( with whom he does not agree 100 \) for the benefit of the reader to call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself i feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers read this book with an open mind read the chapeters on pac and marriage pac and children pac and social implications pac and moral values in this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day it tries to teach something good \( and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute \) thanks,positive

noah webster s book is fascinating reading for today s students and teachers alike as well as for the average citizen as there is much to learn from it while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text it certainly has a place in every school library one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used with diacritical marks \( accents \) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants words are divided according to syllables and stress it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching the terminology of traditional grammar is used and there are copious word lists with words grouped according to common factors i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects \( now archaisms thy thou foreign words and phrases abbreviations explained punctuation etc \) this book should remain a spelling classic,positive

anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the left behind series since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture indeed the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house and christian or not who hasn t heard of the term antichrist or the significance of the number 666 this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology including the role of israel russia the arab countries europe and the united states it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years \( turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along \) the final chapter written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union demonstrates how once again premillenial thought adjusts itself \( or sometimes not \) depending upon world conditions this is a fair even handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon,positive
i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001 then it was a mere idea from that time on until august 20th 2002 i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover patriot that he is but also a flag i loved it couldn t be more happy well the day of the book s release i took a day off work \( i ve never missed a day of work before in my life \) and rushed to get this book it looked better than i ever imagined with the flag on the cover and the title of let freedom ring i thought finally technology has caught up to our patriotism i expected a book filled with flags flags with sound effects maybe some firework sound effects boy was i wrong i opened the book only to the colors black and white no red no blue no stars and stripes i quickly turned the pages looking searching for flags i found none no sound effects either no fireworks at that point i went into a 4 year long depression i nearly committed suicide at several points it s only now that i can bring myself to review this man s book patriot that he is i say this so you know what you re getting yourself into there are no flags no stars and stripes no fireworks no sound effects i have since recovered but only because of old stars and stripes i went back to teaching last year not fully recovered and my colleagues knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes suggested i have my class do a research project find the most patriotic book ever made the methodoloy was simple a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest we found some very good books and they did cheer me up the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called president jesus how jesus wrote the constitution freed the slaves and won world war ii its published by a small church in texas i was very proud of my students for finding it it has brought countless joy to my life along with the book made entirely out of a flag with flag pictures and written in blue and red ink you get a giant flag i m not sure of the dimensions but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck i ve draped it over my house and it covers it completely people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time smiling,negative
i love peterson s guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell s or edward s guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone howell s is certainly the most complete but edward s guide is a bit handier in the field,negative

while the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive what i think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics an example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter but doesn t go into detail on how to tie the structural members together he just tells you that you need to tie them together what if you don t have a shoelace to use what other alternates are there this book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire but it s not enough for the serious camper,negative

it s disturbing to see how many mistakes i found just browsing through this colorful attractive book though the state bird of alabama is known locally as yellowhammer you will not find that name in any field guide the accompanying picture was no help either in identifying what turned out to be the common flicker other state birds were listed by uncommon incorrect misleading names too the 1995 bombing in oklahoma city is represented by a nice picture and writeup but with a glaring misspelling in its headline in memorium should be in memoriam claremore ok is misspelled as clarmore on the map these errors leaped out at me just flipping through the pages this is very disappointing and makes me wonder what other misinformation this book contains adults have some knowledge and experience against which to measure what they read schoolchildren who may be learning facts for the first time need the facts to be correct,negative
this story should have and could have been really good it presents a great concept but the story is just so poorly crafted it is very sexist the prose is stiff and the plot is dull i will concede that it was interesting at times it kept me reading but i really didn t get much out of it i can only praise heinlein for including the intelligent conversation which takes place after the press conference where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn the whole story is just very odd do read it though it s a title to read if you wish to be considered well read despite its faults valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten just as we will never forget atticus from to kill a mockingbird,negative
the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological philosophical foundations of the emerging confession there is value in that i look forward to reading part two the liturgical ideas section the emerging church is keen on praxis but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom which i had hoped we were past here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book which it might help to know 1 rollins does not think it s possible to really know much theology with certainty in fact to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an idolatrous view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans and because in his view god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views he is very certain of his interpretations of perceptive thinkers like nietzsche freud and marx eckhart augustine etc and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really really faulty as i m reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament so be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible s basic content he is certain that no one should be certain but him ok to be fair he is not certain if christianity is true and says so on page 44 but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity nor i guess should you with his view of critique of ideology how can he be so selective of what he is certain of this seems like a self defeating ideology so strong is his disdain for knowing with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer in my opinion he says the church is not to be about giving answers but helping raise in people questioning indeed given his views how could he provide answers this book may look deep i propose it is merely muddy 2 he redefines age old terms orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes but how loosely one holds it certainty of revealed truth is dangerous misinformed idolatrous heresy is now a cute little thing it has come of age he says people will think his views undermine christianity we are to just take him at his word that his views won t do so but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would i think see the writing on the wall 3 he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns those like himself at least to even understand the gospel he has not how can he be a bridge to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down not without mystery nor without debate but in a very real and tangible way he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else 4 he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them the problem that is huge and no one seems to notice is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps he considers fundamentalists and by logical extension many evangelicals to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term heresy i kept thinking what kind of fundamentalists is he so angry at he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals making generalizations that are misleading very unobjective unkind very divisive yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom i can see his views bringing unity to all religions but it will never bring unity to christendom he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom times have really changed in the past 20 years he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind 5 he makes god hopelessly difficult god wanted it seems to speak in a plain brown wrapper the common language of the people the dust of humanity the lowly donkey ride the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining human reason as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said i am the truth into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it god s message is simple it s clear where it needs to be it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated rollins makes it nearly all enigma hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it yet who has been unwilling or incapable given man s weaknesses or his own lack of communication skills to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly if as tickle says this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man s religion the anything goes religion and following generations will have to deconstruct today s extreme and irrational over reaction to fundamentalism peter i can learn some stuff from you and i m sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points your views trouble me nothing against you personally forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more though it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor regardless if it inspires i ll come back and add a star hmmm,negative

this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown s career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection cynthia rose s living in america the soul saga of james brown geoff brown s biography james brown and ofcourse the brown tucker the godfather of soul james brown all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician s mind but this one has a stronger narrative a bit less guarded his late 80s fall is described in a more contrite way for example his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men then immediately moves on to the next thought even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality obviously directed at the female fans ever recorded similarly his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap hip hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self righteous there is alot of adult content in his catalogue which can t be explained away as art however fans can trace his development into more cerebral music with more and more sensitive ballads and socially conscious tunes being produced from the late 60s on i was happy to read his description of little richard s assistance in his early career but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor the influence is quite obvious and not just on chonnie on chon another depressing ommission is with marva whitney his popular lead female vocalist from c 67 to 70 a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup despite the above concerns with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world just listen to don t be a drop out i don t want nobody to give me nothing the man in the glass i m not demanding it s christmas time and peace in the world,positive

so many disbelievers out there i feel so sorry for you no magic left in your dull and predictable worlds of course this book is on the level while my dog ernestine does not build art pieces as such she s a pretty good cook and a crack shot so why not dog artists the review of dog art is a little species centric however most of the dog artists i know use faecies or urine to construct art or engage in performance pieces rooting the leg and licking the balls spring to mind dog culture can be appreciated by humans but is not the same as human cuture so a little less chauvanism please ms mathison,positive
not many writers can characterize children realistically somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff this is definately not one of those novels carson mccullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters f jasmine and john henry west i really cannot think of another story maybe a good man is hard to find by flannery o conner where the writer can get inside the mind of a child evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease john henry west is one of the most well rounded and well written children i have ever read and that is a great homage to her writing ability i first read this at ten can see that age or older reading it will have a intense impact on a sensitive pre teen reader,positive
when one begins to despair about the quality \( or lack thereof \) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that i finished all too quickly i could not get enough of it the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly his employer a lord darlington is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans and what did mr stevens think of this he didn t he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr stevens you ll have to read the book if you want to know more i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not if you get this book you will not be sorry,positive
this book was a huge disappointment sue grafton and kinsey meander all over california but come up with nothing of substance the author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive the characters and their actions are bogus and contrived for example kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before it doesn t work because it isn t real it is sue grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess the story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters when it was all over i still didn t know why the murders had been committed save your eyesight do not bother picking up this book,negative

the content is excellent the digital format is largely useless i bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition but the digital rights management restrictions mean that i can t print selected pages to stick in a folder read on the train or scribble notes on i can t even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic notes file the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one,negative
i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality blamires had c s lewis as a tutor and i ve read some of lewis s writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special \( many people do find his works special of course \) blamires on the other hand i find to be very unique his book is top quality and very helpful i m surprised this isn t a very popular book as it ought to be i have only two complaints both of which are purely stylistic first the edition i have looks like it s a copy of an earlier edition which makes the text hard to read \( i got used to it after a while though \) some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it my second criticism is something that can t be avoided the book was originally written in the early sixties so a lot of the examples are dated \( i e references to wwii which was still in memory also out of date terms like jive etc \) however just a few of the examples are affected by this the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work since so much blamires s criticism of the christian mind \( or lack thereof \) still \( sadly \) applies however the christian mind today is being rediscovered and the march of atheism is on the decline with the march of religion in general on the rise even though things are looking up christians should keep blamires s book in mind not to get too comfortable with this \( secular \) world for our real home is beyond bodily death that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book superb book and i really recommend this to anyone this is definitely recommended for christians and also for any non christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today,positive
i bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school they did not like the narrator s snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words this is a great cd for high school or adults but not children a bust for us,negative
i have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost 5 years now last year i had over 1400 seedlings on multi level shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room \( boy do i need a greenhouse \) so this book was not a lot of new information to me a lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet but it s not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before i buy it \( this is important because i m not interested in refrigerating my seeds 3 weeks before i plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds \) one major thing missing from this book was photography there were drawings but i m sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool on the good side this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant \( annual perennial etc \) its hardiness zone and its flowering season this allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone the regular index wasn t very useful but one wonderful addition was an index of the common latin names i refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography i was missing \( almost makes up for it almost \) of course there is the standard hardiness zone map but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates \( nice \) also included was a directory of seed companies and their addresses all in all this book does a good job of covering the seed part but a poor job of covering the bloom part,positive

i have read other books by alesia holliday and enjoyed them so i looked forward to reading this book unfortunately i could not get any farther than the first 25 pages i even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and i still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away the best i can do to pin down why i dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard no character seems to even approach reality they are all including the main character and her love interest over the top,negative

i can tell you first hand how amazon makes easy money i am a formal seller here at amazon not a big seller but an honest one with a 5 star rating and zero claims however amazon allows dishonest buyer s to do chargebacks months after a purchase and then has nothing in place to assist seller s in getting their merchandise back sounds like retail fraud to me i wish there was a lower rating to give to this website they are truly at the bottom,negative

this book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of mysql this is a thick book that covers a lot of material the last chapters even provided introductions to application development with c perl and php mysql the complete reference really seemed like an actual complete reference while it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic most of the focus was on sql \( structured query language \) though there were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors for one thing you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise also it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so i could follow along in more of the examples frequently my result set wouldn t quite match the one in the book additionally some of the command wouldn t even execute or would return an error message lastly the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages but i believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that i was running mysql on windows although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a unix installation also mysql would be several versions newer on my computer i believe that made a difference on some of the results as well and for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested gui programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt so i wasn t quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another nevertheless there were still plenty of quality examples i could follow along in in addition there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material overall this book works well as a reference or for working the chapters in order even though the book s user level isn t indicated i believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner,positive
i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book this is not a book about cosmology \( as people would expect from roger penrose \) in this tiny book penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes \( something much different from the opinion of 99 99 of neurobiologists such as steven pinker \) this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell mann the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories \( thus the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works \) some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn t had in mind that this book is about penrose s point of view on intelligence in fact i m not a physicist nor a biologist simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand although i do not agree with penrose s point of view i think he forgot something very important read it and read the other point of view and you ll find what it is,positive

the literature of september 11 is never attacked when a book speaks of september 11 \( or of terrorism in general \) it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy jonathan safran foer s extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy on such reverence the narrative which concerns a nine year old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock unshell the enigma of his dead father \( a narrative stolen in its basic outline from guenther grass s die blechtrommel \) could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel the others include hiroshima nagasaki the staten island ferry crash and the dresden bombings each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity but historical trauma itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement inspired creation oskar the insufferable brat attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father thomas schell jr a victim of september 11 by compiling an almanac of self inflicted wounds the collage of images and letters which is the book we are reading an almanac which most likely is written sometime in the indefinite future \( thomas shell sr s manuscript of 4 12 78 is heavily edited \( pp 208 216 \) who has done the editing almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar \) if the term reading even applies whenever a pregnant image is described foer literally re presents it in the form of a pictorial image when a flock of birds rises into the sky it is not enough that we read of these birds we must see them as well words may not be left in their invisibility we are presented with supplementary photographs illustrations since mere verbality is not enough \( indeed the entire novel oozes with misologos the mistrust or hatred of language in terms of both its content and its form \) photographs yes and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes for instance typography does not substitute for a well wrought sentence foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities most specifically the responsibility to write well why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal as far as the writing is concerned it is composed of nothing other than mind numbingly soul deadeningly repetitive phrases \( heavy boots raison d etre etc \) and sunday school platitudes sometimes one simply wants to disappear \( 184 \) there s nothing wrong with not understanding yourself \( 184 \) everything that s born has to die which means our lives are like skyscrapers \( 245 \) how can you say i love you to someone you love it s always necessary \( 314 \) whenever the author writes something that he finds beautiful and true \( 165 \) he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is beautiful and true the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus a very deep truth indeed one that foer also communicates in his essay emptiness \( originally published in playboy \) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians \( ringo star \) and scientists \( stephen hawking \) are unthreateningly approachable everything is familiarized perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close since the entire book is a vacuum null space into which readers may project their own meanings joseph suglia ph d the author of watch out,negative

why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust confidence and cons though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u s exploded into civil war its insights cross cultural boundaries this is not an easy book to read for several reasons first it is undoubtedly one of the first post modern novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling \( another example dostoevsky s notes from the underground \) the confidence man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat beggars absurdly dressed frontiersmen sickly misers shysters patent medicine hucksters veterans \( of the mexican american war \) and the hero in the latter part of the book the cosmopolitan in typical melville fashion you also get asides directly to the reader in several cases as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel the lack of structure action and conclusion make this a post modern type book but if you read each conversation as a separate story then it starts to make more sense for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme the nature of trust and confidence in a very sly way melville shows how a variety of cons are worked as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do buy the herbal patent medicine buy shares in a bogus stock venture or donate cash to a suspect charity in other chapters it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself since the book is mostly conversations we are left to our own conclusions there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust we don t want to be taken but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted to trust no one is to be entirely isolated melville also raises the question is it always a bad thing to be conned the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life the ornery frontiersman who s been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth talking employment agency owner is that a terrible thing to trust despite a history of being burned the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored we think the cosmopolitan is a con man but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum he returns it just to prove a point is that a continuance of the con or is he actually trustworthy the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens in a traditional society things operate in rote ways young people follow in their parents traditional roles money is made and lent according to unchanging standards and faith tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well worn pathways but in america none of this structure is available even in melville s day america was a polyglot culture on the move you had to decide who to trust based on their dress manner and speech pitch the con of course works on precisely this necessity to rely on one s senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods so the con man dresses well and has a good story and an answer for every doubt the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long leisurely clause upon clause sentences but the book is also peppered with his sly humor which sneaks up on you well just like a good con,positive

i m trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i can t decide among the following travels through guilt with the world s 33rd richest hippie the mind of an empty suit a self important revisionist history how i learned to hate myself and love the third world memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy then the moral outrage of this book makes sense but there s a whole lot to swallow on the plus side it s a fast and somewhat entertaining read otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self loathing that takes about 20 years to surface one of the things that i ve had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny as i look at the 20th century i think of most of it focused on the economics of perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america rues the lives of poor peasants and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric but you can t imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx weber engles friere or anyone back when i was a bit more blackified i referred to such people as culture vultures if it s indigenous it s good but you ll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics literacy rates crime rates or even inflation i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil technically you ll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia basically perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is was and always will be the american way you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game it s a confession all right by the time i got 2 3rds of the way through reading the book began to become annoying the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory we learn that he took one of his charges \( female \) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean but that when he got there he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance the best book i ve read is my life as a quant if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy the best book to read is larry kolb s overworld if you want to get well written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era then this is your book but it s nowhere near as good as say the quiet american you can imagine that perkins who is a great admirer of graham greene might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus but he is to honest to consider himself heroic and i suspect that he ll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life in that regard confessions of an economic hitman is \( now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition \) a blueprint for american liberal guilt if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well deserved kharmic smackdown it is john perkins he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine you d think being a pseudo economist that he d have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton ahh but that would mean that he d have to admire courage i didn t want to be a harsh judge of perkins i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life one of conviction and then epiphany instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that corporatocray is evil this book has been a disappointment in many ways i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this good parts yeah there are a few he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders he gives a few details about saudi aramco but compared to larry kolb s fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi this is romper room if perkins thought he was an agent don t make me laugh,negative
please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature read this book yourself before giving it to your child it discusses oral sex anal sex how to use and purchase condoms masturbation \( for girls and boys \) etc when the author discusses exploring your own sexuality she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth as she would have stopped sucking her thumb the cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within it is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve for many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate,negative
the working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology what is being merleau answers in the manner of lao tse and alludes to something like a divine feminine at the heart of wild perception it was said by sartre in his autobiography situations that after merleau s mother died who was like a goddess to him merleau returned began the project anew what is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life and in the end merleau returns to the very object of his study you can really feel this descent at the book nears its end it is however an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension that i assure you,positive
book contains many useful lists charts comparisons to define giftedness many helpful hints about raising a gifted child main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general and may push those with normal kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track when they should not gifted kids are the exception not the norm as this book makes it seem,negative
god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic and yes maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book s great reputation i entered it with high expectations which the book however did not satisfy yes it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time a lampoon of the courtship ritual and of course oh so witty blah blah blah but it just wasn t my cup of tea the main character was likeable but that aside i found it completely insufferable to read through and absolutely painfully boring every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted let alone the ending not that anything really ever happens the entire book could be summed up with then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea walked and talked and had more tea then got married and lived happily ever after the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama it would save more time just to watch a chick flick so if you re interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters witnessing the agony over who s going to marry who \( even though the reader could already predict the happily ever after match making light years in advance \) then this is the book for you if not then i suggest picking up some dan brown,negative

yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn t know how to write my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author s alternative grammatical rules comma splices and run on sentences are not and never will be acceptable to me occasional use can be overlooked but shaara peppers every page with them tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading the following example is made up but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes he turned in the saddle rode toward his headquarters over the ridge refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance focused instead on the day ahead forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run on sentences in a row like this the result is a book that reads like a rough draft or maybe not even that it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft i don t understand how authors get away with publishing such half finished work and i don t understand why readers put up with it another problem is the lack of convincing characterization everyone is vaguely noble here with the exception of a few complete cads washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home i think you get the picture few characters stand out on their own even lafayette is just another young officer the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book and shaara s attempts at making his characters witty never work the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull beyond that i m doubtful about the author s device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter it s fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin s mind but the rest of the time it doesn t work well i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus either i m a lazy reader \( and i m not \) or the device isn t working well in addition this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france and washington green cornwallis and howe in america that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england and the continental congress in america in effect this novel is really about washington s military camp and howe s dinner table which makes the narrative unbalanced some aspects of the story are interesting i enjoy reading about washington s maneuvers and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were and when but i wish now that i d just bought a decent beginner s history on the war most of the book as literary fiction left me cold,negative
though i am not a vogue reader i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w s splashes in the tabloids were all about while the subject is only mildly interesting to me the author s prose reads like a 300 page deposition against anna wintour from everybody who had has a major or minor gripe with her it s a heavy and boring read gossip if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining should remain light and diverting in this book it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it i was very happy to put it down perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job but then again when that time comes anna wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest,negative
overall i think this is a very good book for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around but is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities it also a good track to run on for someone who wants to implement important life changes in an easy step wise fashion there is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone one of the things i most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little by little in eating habits exercise etc this book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense i think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e g eliminated trans fatty acids eating more fiber using more olive oil etc mixed in with some well researched conclusions are dr weil s opinions for example he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen while it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies it is also probably that some of it is on the mark but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate at the least i don t see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people i also like that dr weil takes a holistic approach to health he not only looks at and talks about the body he also addressed stress and relaxation life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health while he is very commercial he is also a harvard trained physician and i do think that he has some very good insights to share while in some ways i think this book can be better i would still recommend it to almost anyone especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits while not every suggestion might be on target i am sure that if someone implemented all the suggestions over eight weeks they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health i have certainly found this to be true and i cheat on some of them,positive

i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the old edition but judging by look inside this book this new english language edition incorporates much material from the old incidentally the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware apparently his taken orthodox name while timothy ware is his original given name in sweden the swedish translation of the orthodox church is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church apparently its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history it also contains chapters on theology and worship in my opinion the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire under islam and in russia both before and during communism of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic orthodox split usually dated to 1054 the author believes that the so called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split however the book must also be read with some reservations the author is after all an orthodox christian himself its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there for instance ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist a very untenable suggestion at other times he is surprisingly liberal for an orthodox for instance he paints mehmet fatih the muslim conqueror of constantinople as a very tolerant ruler i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian even so the orthodox church remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over view of this remarkable christian church,positive
this was an astounding book about an even more astounding woman rachel shilsky a k a ruth mcbride jordan written by one of her 12 children james this book is both biography \( mother \) and autobiography \( child \) a polish jew \( white \) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater virginia ruth met and married two different black men and managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult circumstances in harlem new york not only did she start a baptist church with her husband she coped with a regular dose of racism some significant poverty and still managed to send 12 children to school \( all of whom became professionals and productive citizens \) the book is written by the son but the voice of the mother is registered throughout \( in italic print \) she evades all queries about her background her family in fact any of her history and it is not until much later that the son uncovers her history \( abusive father crippled mother \) and the reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community that was not of her economic racial or religious experience although the book is ostensibly about this man s childhood and his remarkable mother it is also a fascinating glimpse of racism religion and social exclusion in the black communities in new york in the 1960s each of ruth s children experienced a certain unease about their racially different mother and yet each became aware of who they were and what they were about this book is just a marvelous read full of funny and sad tales of a rather unique family life mcbride s work is a tribute to his extraordinary mother,positive
i ll start with the positive the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word tall good looking smart humble etc the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words in short it was a competent work of fiction that s where my praise ends because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas sure it s a work of fiction no one is going to take it seriously yada yada yada but that s not true is it so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged just look at the reviews to find the believers alright here are my problems with it first politicians are corrupt and will sell out anyone to maintain power but that s not true if you re a conservative farm boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state in term limits vince flynn just beats you over the head with the power corrupts mantra he doesn t show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist you know what though there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what s right who really are trying to make a difference for the positive for this nation and the citizens in this book however the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren t smart enough to make good decisions second murder is a viable answer this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy land come on get real this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn t balance the budget and they get away with it because it s really the right side to be on murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation that being elections elections apparently just get in the way third the balanced budget for years and years until the time this book was written conservatives cried about the budget the book makes it the central theme balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible it s important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel a coup yet when the conservatives did take power despite vince flynn s prescient forecasting ability they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn t flinch even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility they claim that now the deficit isn t a big deal that it s really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90 s and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later it s like looking back in time to a parade of nit wits fourth the good guys don t do bad things the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents just the politicians the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it killing is good when only your target dies but whatever happened to that oh so famous though shalt not cv ric,negative
as with many of the for dummies series controlling cholesterol is a well executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol author carol rinzler s light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why target values for cholesterol can differ in different people there s an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins sugar busters and protein power pluses and minuses of each ten cholesterol myths in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients \( in my cardiology practice \) one criticism like all books about cholesterol controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack this is patently untrue but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol there are better ways nonetheless this book does serve its intended purpose very well educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol,positive
this book the relatives came by cynthia rylant and illustrated by stephen gammell was a delight to read i found myself smiling as i read the words that made the artwork come alive likewise i found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit and i felt as if i too were a part of this book having experienced growing up in a small town where you don t see that many people i believe that when relatives come to visit it almost seems like christmas as a result when the book expressed the joy laughter and celebration of family it stirred up these memories of the past unquestionably almost anyone from children to adults could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit,positive
seven times the sun is not for everyone it could be a springboard offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life but the songs poems and traditions offered in shea darian s book are hokey and contrived at best cumbersome and artificial at worst none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book darian is a minister and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent true parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have but i m just thankful amazon has a customer friendly return policy,negative

isn t it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem to which you say yeah yeah that s me and then gives you no answer or a weak one to which you say no duh i m afraid this book is one of them the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you ve only dreamed of or at least point you in the right direction to get started but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we can t have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven i don t believe that s the abundant life jesus promised so i went to the bible \( i should have gone there first \) i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart ps 37 4 so i set out to seek him i started reading knowing god by j i packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire i hope you ll find them too in him,negative
the plot of this book was interesting and it could have been a good book unfortunately it wasn t the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem even many of the the secondary characters are weak miserable people the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a dirty little nobody once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards because she is the daughter of a cit he can t imagine why she has any reservations about the deal he says charming things to her like how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway now that s romance meanwhile even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times she finds herself drawn to him too for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim she never stood up for herself and you felt sorry for her of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter including her in fact just about the only one who doesn t know is the hero which provides the dilemma he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn t a nobody will anyone tell him will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn t good enough for him will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn t think she is good enough for him to marry of course it all works out and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him ugh this could have been a good book if the mystery had been handled better and the characters were written differently as is it is a sad regency tale,negative
i had a chance to read this book cover to cover all i can say is absolutely outstanding short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field very rarely do i encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well it is optimally reader friendly the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts new concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully i strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in epidemiology established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge i hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style,positive
if you liked whyte s previous sophomoric efforts you ll love this in addition to being the same dumb hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler in no real way does the story get advanced arthur begins as a baby and ends as a small boy there are adventures but nothing important happens as usual in whyte s books the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters with all the \( totally ahistorical \) democratic rhetoric merlin s brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot anyone who would read this i guess has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn t object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence caricatures who never grow or change and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship so go for it but please if you want something exciting that will also make you think look at the really good arthurian efforts out there gillian brandshaw a a attanasio or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few,negative
i am a gigantic james brown fan i have 100 albums 130 singles i ve met him 5 times seen him live over 100 times since 1971 had lunch with him in nyc and i am the paul in the jb section of gerri hirshey s nice history of soul music nowhere to run but if this book was written by james brown or if he even had much to tell the writer i ll eat my refrigerator it is so full of errors that it is laughable one of the most glaring errors was when mr brown supposedly said say it loud was where funk started or something to that effect that is so ridiculous james brown would never say such a thing any student of funk knows that cold sweat was the quintessentional funk piece and it is not even mentioned in the book the style of mr brown s sentences that are attributed to him sound nothing like him i have no idea why this was put out the other autobiography written over a decade ago was more relevent and much better written the godfather of soul by jb and bruce tucker someone \( alan leeds \) needs to write a 600 page comprehensive biography of mr brown with much more detail,negative

the cover of this book compares it to the kite runner so it caught my attention i honestly could not stop reading as yasmina khadra does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters he weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people s humanity my only nit is the ending was a bit predictable that said it was still a very good ending that rings true spoiler if you wonder why she didn t come back consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street which led to them being stopped which ultimately resulted in her husband s death i honestly can t wait to read more by yasmina khadra,positive

introducing postmodernism is a good source to gather names of philosophers architects artists anthropologists linguists and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm the problem and it is a big one is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines sure if you only have half an hour to read up on pm you can whip through this book and go on with your life but if you re wanting to really absorb the phenomenon and perhaps go on to read more this book is not the place to start check out david harvey s condition of postmodernism this will rip the top of your head clean off it s much more weighty \( in every sense of the word \) but your understanding of pm will vastly improve and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the genre,negative
eugene o neill s play long day s journey into night is a pulitzer award winning autobiographical play about his family i must admit that though eugene o neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater i did not enjoy reading this play the tyrone family s insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o neill offered no conclusion the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends no happy ending no hope for the future just despair long day s journey into night is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without however after learning more about eugene o neill s background and the extent to which the play is based on his life i began to have a greater appreciation for this play o neill did lead a very hard life therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o neill s talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner while o neill s depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending it was appropriate for the play as eugene s own family never got a happy ending i did like the clever way o neill showed the tyrone family s desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal loving family the audience soon however gets the suspicion that something isn t quite right and that the family is tense slowly the family s skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth although i still believe long day s journey into night to be thoroughly disheartening to read the reader s emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o neill s exceptional writing,negative

seventeen year old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things dancing dressing and reading sensational novels but doing these things won t get you a husband or acquaint you with other young ladies such as yourself so upon request from a neighbor catherine is invited to spend some time in bath a fashionable town where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature who are not related to her and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious yet conniving family and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney along with his charming sister eleanor and whisked off to their ancestral home known only as northanger abbey there catherine s choice of reading material mysteries and ghost stories that is comes back to haunt her for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night such as creaking and frightening winds that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors and a curious history only heightens young catherine s suspicions and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey and the tilney family in general jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore and decided to purchase it i will admit that hands down this has become one of my favorite austen books catherine is an enchanting character whose innocence and naivete make her charming from beginning to end while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers catherine s interactions with isabella thorpe and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters while the charming henry tilney like mr darcy makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman and our young heroine a wonderful satirical piece of fiction that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape,positive

i was expecting this book to be a great story but very disappointed i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is the book is insipid and dull has no flow no story or no plot let me present an example i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan for example sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way if talk is getting cheaper why did mci worldcom pay 115 billion to buy sprint the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world can regulators handle the complex new order it has a clear logical axis and has a force to attract readers into it but jeter describes it like this the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit it always presents off center trivial detail which makes a reader bored 70 of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact like the merger of company a b raised the stock to x etc there is no insight here but unfortunately unlike enron scandal there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost,negative
it doesn t sound like the people you list as reasons not to read this book actually read this book there is a big difference in my opinion of putting positive affirmations in your mind versus a witch doctor and quite honestly it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in conjuction with medical care does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care because you will most definitely be healed no where so in my opinion one has to have a sound mind and not view the book as a cure all for all the ills in life but rather a positive way to enhance your life it is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care when you have a terminal illness or any other illness for that matter but according to what i gather from the book you can use positive affirmations and believe that you are getting well to help keep yourself in a positive state rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well studies aside from this book have proven that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook have done wonders for recovering patients along with their medical care your review did not address any of those people that read this book because the two examples of people you list it is apparent they didn t read the book either \( not sure what compelled you to post here \) therefore you are not qualified in my opinion to critique this book as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist did they prescribe drinking snakes blood too anyway this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick and those that do probably won t be addressing their medical problem can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis i imagine it can \( studies prove it can \) in addition to proper medical treatment anyway you might want to actually read the book instead of making comments of what happened to so and so who didn t even read it or apply it including yourself,positive

from the cover and a quick glances at some of the colorful photo filled chapters this book seem promising at first but the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover has taken its toll this book provides marginal advice on how to potentially make a profit from the wonderful world of digital photography however it fails to give any real world working model on how this can be accomplished most of the marginally useful advices and sales model i e pricing structure on stock photos are based on the author s own personal preference and experience rather than taking into account the wide breadth of pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography this is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict table of content perspective of the available methods and channels of distribution to target e g card stock stock photo art fairs etc most of topics cover seem to be more theoretical than actual real world hands down information and the author seems to expend more time energy and care in expressing his disdain \( with a condescending overtone might i add \) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and quick his favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs includes but certainly are not limited to prima donnas pretentious and pretend aficionado heller may be a self aggrandizing professional photographer but anyone with such high caliber should be more helpful than pompous or supercilious remember heller you were an amateur at one point too further more heller likes to take a seemingly interesting idea get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn t pursue it because the odds are just too high against you bottomline if you are serious about licensing your photographs for use then this book does not really cover the core foundations that you need to get your feet wet on the otherhand if you want to take a look at what you can do to potentially make a profit from your hobby then this book basically gives you an general idea i d give this book a 1 star for the lack of usable information and the author s cockiness but it does contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a 2 star rating,negative

a remarkable introduction to ezra pound makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the cantos periplous ideogram fugue the repeat in history and gives concise readings of individual sections that helped my understanding enormously he does an especially good job of connecting pound s theory of money to his views on sex and creativity makin manages to be critical of pound while treating his ideas with verve and sympathy the writing is colloquial witty and jargon free i enjoyed the cantos much more after reading this short effective study,positive
when i read alpha male syndrome i saw myself and the many alphas i ve worked with in high tech corporate america in some instances i could call out the names of those i d either worked with or had family relationships or friendships with based on the alpha types strengths and risk behaviors so well defined in this book i found the practical tips encouraging specific change in those who don t seem open to changing to be useful hopeful encouraging and sometimes even funny i may go broke sending alpha male syndrome to my too many alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or live with them from soup to nuts i enjoyed recognizing and knowing myself better through the book and from taking the author s online alpha assessment then following the action steps in the book and updated online alpha tips i can see how and why ms ludeman and dr erlandson s approach to executive coaching is effective,positive
i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were heisenberg s uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned hawking made it seem like common sense hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times \( and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points just in case you missed them \) but all in all this was a quite readable account of what s presently known about cosmology i use the term presently guardedly as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter \( it exists \) but from now on when there are new findings in physics i want hawking to explain them to me because i feel like then i might understand them that s why you should read this book the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical this was still a hard read and i feel like i grasped maybe 80 of it for you to decide but for a former engineering student this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics,positive

i tend to like just about anything that brubaker writes while i m not as excited about his marvel work as most others are i have enjoyed his runs on captain america and daredevil his work outside of marvel has been great sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years in general brubaker had not written anything that i genuinely disliked then came deadly genesis in short this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results to what end another summers brother who is completely disinteresting another story in which professor x acts like a jerk a dead x men \( for absolutely no good reason \) and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years i want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate unfortunately this is the second instance in which brubaker has went back and altered marvel history from long ago in captain america he made it so that bucky never really died in world war ii this initially rubbed me the wrong way but the story itself was done well and the surrounding plots were good so i begrudgingly went along for the ride i was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book his attempt to revise history doesn t work nearly as well here the key difference is that bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust he hadn t been written into any stories during all that time so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him in deadly genesis brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago in order for them to work the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward it just doesn t work to make matters worse none of the characters motivation for anything makes any sense at all characters are keeping secrets and other characters are upset with that and through the whole you never understand why it s as if brubaker had an end goal in mind and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point a to point b even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn t make complete sense that aside another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as captain america they overall plot doesn t make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment the interior art is nice though not great unfortunately the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration,negative
a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball nuts who grew up in new york we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny wonder five who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 \( it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled \) this book is a fictional addendum to rosen s non fiction treatment of the original basketball scandals as he outlines in his npr interview unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors broadway and 43rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan madison square garden has been on 23rd street and is now above penn station in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college and they undermine the author s credibility and care in writing since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence the game of who is this really is inescapable hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers and a couple are in the hall of fame this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy \( holy cross 49 \) dick mcguire \( st johns 48 \) bobby wanzer \( seton hall 46 \) and frank mcguire the legendary coach at st john s north carolina and south carolina,negative
f this self help industry crap quasi astrological poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack man warrior female maiden title what s his name gives them and remember this doctor is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives so why do you let s push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self help industry to the torch that s a great start to a sane life,negative
this book up to the very end was very good with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half the end is what ruins the entire thing don t worry i m not going to spoil anything i ll just say the ending stinks out loud this story is not really horror its sifi a adventure drama sifi it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough the writting was dead on as always and character development was good this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book,negative

the writing was very disjointed in my opinion i had to read and re read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say it was a struggle to read no likeable characters i made it to the part where it was introduced that madeline slept with the ex husband and current wife give me a break i moved on immediately too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale,negative
peter balakian s book black dog of fate tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them in essence it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling i wish the author had done a bit more in depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non armenians for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative unengaged and unconvincing pity since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football the yankees modern poetry and exposing turkish attempts to buy \( among others \) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism practiced by the modern turkish state and its organs it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels the i and we and us occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice but is it realy since in order to make this legitimate the writer must distance himself at least initially from all this old world exotica and like the reader question their validity or relevance in present day north american society what are all these old world old fashioned ghosts and traditions is the first cry of writer and reader alike only ofcourse to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein this culture and this lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic memory free self redefining comfort seeking and buying mores in the balakian tale one encounters suburbia instead of substance worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism the abstract and unemotional or else towards medicine respectability and detachment young balakian observes but never understands the grandmother for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find their crime is self denial and a march to the tune of america s mixmaster piper be unlike your past and your future will be brighter seems to be what america promises at the very least the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying as if to serve sweet irony full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday peter is lost alright but as the book sadly shows he remains lost paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make \( for that read vahakn dadrian s the history of the armenian genocide berghahn books 1995 \) episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear say and as mere isolated incidents leading to more harm than good \( for if better evidence existed the arguement goes why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare \) for the story to have worked for the story to have really worked as i would have liked it to balakian s life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it and his relationship with his wife who like him is not leading a strongly armenian existence would have had to have changed solidifying his roots celebrating his new found identity and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which alas never appear on the pages of this book how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness except that the transition has not occured the ship of armenianness sails by balakian he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it but not resolved enough to climb aboard that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future read mark arax s book in my father s name \( simon schuster 1996 \) where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax one can only hope that balakian s partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer \( not withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers \) this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second i speak here of passage to ararat by michael arlen \( hungry mind republication 1996 \) where a disinterested soit disant armenian goes to armenia in the 70 s and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people s woes and dreams too little too late and always detached is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold however i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories will be written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home,positive
grudem seems to have a very distorted and confused vision of christ we can only hope that evangelical become more like christ jesus was the first real liberal and the most radical of liberals if jesus of nazareth was anything he was an extraordinary friend of the down trodden definitely a liberal whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the ultra conservative religious and political leaders of his day that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in jesus own words on this web site those who actually know what the bible says about the life and teaching of jesus recognize that far from being like jesus of nazareth today s religious right are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the day they had him nailed to a cross although these people claim to represent jesus christ they rarely quote his teaching or follow his example what they do instead is use his name \( in vain \) to promote their ideas ideas which jesus himself did not teach and might well have opposed,negative
this book is a romance and i liked it my only excuse is it s a classic romance i loved it in fact it s on my top ten favorite books list it wasn t gross it wasn t weird it wasn t annoyingly romantic i loved it \( i might say that a few more times \) i loved elizabeth jane mr bennet s relations with mrs bennet mr darcy mr bingly mr collins \( my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie \) i can t even find words to describe how much i loved this book i read it this summer and i m still at a loss for words all i can say is i ll definitely be picking up more classics and my book of jane austen s works will soon be veeeery well worn,positive

alexander pope was not of the romantic period and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a gre subject test this alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions asks for identification of the most obscure passages and frequently explains why b was the right answer and why a c and d were wrong but leaves that status of e wholly to the realm of mystery the practice test sent out with the gre registration is different in scope clarity and difficulty i actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration don t buy this book don t even steal it spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it,negative
i read this years after i d read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it wasn t as rewarding as the first two books were maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style i dunno i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff j d salinger s the man,positive
i bought this book this weekend as we re doing the pre five in a row w our preschooler and i don t much like it i ve got a mother w borderline personality disorder and who doesn t observe personal boundaries of other s what so ever \( if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and friends ugh \) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her stalker mom mentality in the end i think if a person is from a semi normal household w proper respect for a child s boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too smoothering even ones w o personality disorders and this book doesn t send a message about love as much as i own you i like mama do you love me better for explaining to a child a parent s unconditional love good night moon by margaret wise brown however is by far my children s all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he s from a fairly normal family take it w a grain of salt,negative
i didn t know why i chose to read this book anyway it was disappointing really the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it s making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow but taylor s self conflict was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father s death well then it s really his fault he was a coward if you don t believe me go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it s towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book and what did i find nothing oh what a waste it s like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it didn t really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like if it hadn t been for my hrr \( home reading report \) i wouldn t have finished reading this at all i guess i m saying this because i m not into this genre love stories are fine but this one nah,negative
although the photographs are dated the material is classic this book is a must for anyone who is involved with design or review of open spaces it shows how people use open space and identifies the common elements of successful spaces while the elements all seem logical the book shows how we often fly in the face of logic when using these spaces the book focuses primarily on plazas and small parks in new york city but includes a section for smaller cities with low rise buildings the information can also be applied to parks in any size town this book is a facinating case study in social ecology,positive
