i read the review for this product on amazon lindsey who is one of the 2 reviewers of this product actually had posted a video of the product usage and i was very much convinced by that i thought the product is good and ordered it immediately the product arrived in 4 5 days and was in good condition the most important problem with the roti maker is 1 the roti tortilla is not cooked properly it remains very much uncooked even though you see it puff and everything from the inside it remains uncooked which actually causes a lot of acidity problems 2 also such an uncooked tortilla when left for a few minutes becomes very dry and difficult to eat you have to eat the tortilla immediately within 10 15 minutes of the making just imagine if you are making 5 7 tortillas the first one will be come dry and difficult to chew 3 the product works as described but the tortillas are not at all good for health since they remain uncooked in the inside,negative
petmate makes a great fountain but their black model should be discontinued it is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it when i went to wash this fountain like i usually do every couple of weeks there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it i think the pump motor might have been leaking \( i m not really sure \) if i had their white fountain i would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away,negative
this pan along with several others i have acquired from the calphalon tri ply line is fantastic great weight and balance superb craftsmanship the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all the pricing is terrific i have all clad and yes it is wonderful but quite frankly i find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less and it is still made in u s a,positive
in anthoney bourdain s book kitchen confidential he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs don t use henkle or wustoff knives they use global cat cora of american iron chef also uses global knives i needed a good knife in my kitchen so i decided to check out global as well first of all it s incredibly light if i m chopping a lot of onions for a french onion soup or making a big batch of mirepoix for some beef stock i notice that lightness then there s the balance see that notch where the blade meets the handle pick the knife up by that notch and it balanced exactly level try that with a standard knife and you ll see how handle heavy they are finaly the edge these knives are insanely sharp they cut like a dream i just went to a knife sharpening clinic by wustoff and they suggest honeing your knife with 5 or 6 stroks on a steel before every meal that you cook i ve found that this keeps the edge razor sharp however you should realize that the edge on these knives is at 15 degrees not 20 degrees so adjust the angle you use to hone the edge overall it s an amazing knife take care of it and it will serve you as a professional quality tool for a long time,positive
it works well and it s good for the price not too stable and sturdy but it gets the job done just fine,positive
for the price you get what you pay for they are not the best quality,negative
the first time i used it i couldn t even boil water in it on my flat surface stove a notice that came with it said this pot may not work on all stoves refer to the owners manual \( no owners manual was sent with it \) as soon as the water started to heat the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface it would have been nice to have known before ordering as i am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details,negative
i had a small version of salad shooter it was great used it for so many years but now the blade was dull and i kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them i decided the next salad shooter i buy should be slightly larger so i bought this salad shooter professional series which is great having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day multiple cones to change large feeding place for the veggy fast light eassy to clean including in the dishwasher still small enough to store in small spaces efortless to cut and shread your veggy no need for knife and cutting board what i like the most about this product is the fact that when i put veggy in it to be cut shread the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut so i do not have to push it in probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades this way your work is done in no time in my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen,positive
my three cats adore this playpen just moments after putting it on the floor they started playing with the tease they also love snuggling in the bed together \( 2 cats fit at a time \) my only complaint is that i can t find the replacement teases they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non catnip styles the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i can t find them at petco s online store i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find,positive
i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer s comments mine too arrived broken sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces combined score 2,negative
these rings are much too big and too lightly made for egg muffins and the eggs spill out the bottom of the rings total junk don t waste your money on these ring,negative
the good \( function \) 1 \) rubber non slip base and good weighting 2 \) clear plastic allows full view of soap level 3 \) long spout allows easy access to sink no counter spills 4 \) smooth pumping action no clogs 5 \) pump goes all the way to the bottom sucks it all out 6 \) wide opening makes it easy to transfer soap from a large bottle the bad \( aesthetics \) 1 \) not beautiful \( not horribly ugly either \) 2 \) no choice of color would have preferred white to match kitchen appliances verdict function wins out over aesthetics highly recommended,positive
the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised it has three nested work bowls the inner smallest one takes a special blade \( a smaller version of the standard processor blade \) it s perfect for pulverizing mixing small quantities of things pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest 12 cup bowl a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box \( finally a way to keep everything together \) the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl it s the kind with the rotating hub \( two hub sizes are included one for lemons and a larger one for oranges etc \) while it seems to work it s not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black decker but what the heck it s worth trying the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it at first i was disappointed that there weren t any fancy front panel switch options but after thinking about it you only need the provided on off and pulse would i buy it again absolutely would i buy it again from amazon again absolutely the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised,positive

rarely does a product move me to write a review but i have found myself increasingly using the net \( and amazon \) to review products i am not really familiar with before buying them rice cookers were one of those products so i thought i d share my experience since i had a hard time finding a review for this rice cooker to help others out we were microwave rice and stovetop rice cookers until we started eating a lot of sushi then we wanted something to make the perfect rice this is it the first time we used it i let my girlfriend make the rice it boiled over and made a huge mess and came out totally mushy i was bummed i spent 200 on a rice cooker that was going to be messy or difficult to use then i watched my girlfriend making it the second time and realized she was putting in 2 times the amount of water required following the directions the 25 or 30 times we have used it since we get absolutely perfect rice white rice sticky rice whatever it is sylish so it doesn t look like a little crock pot sitting in my contemporary kitchen the cord retracts into the base for convenience and the thing couldn t be easier to clean the rice pot the lid and the steam vent pop out and are easily cleaned wipe the rest down with a damp paper towel and you re done so easy rarely is set it and forget it associated with perfection but in this case it is would i prefer if it was 100 150 sure but i paid 200 and don t regret it,positive
i am a contractor and when i recently remodeled doug and susans basement i was eventually shown how to use the grinder to make espresso while on breaks unfortunately i started taking lots of breaks good espresso the grinder is quiet precise and efficient like an excellent sub contractor or a good table saw the grinder was great i use a burr grinder at my house but you can t even talk over the thing this one whirs below a conversation level then stores the suberbly consistant ground coffee i then pull the lever a couple times to dispense premeasured amounts into the doser that is resting in its holder on the machine and there it is break is on thanks for the good times and good espresso on my way to hawk some of my tools to buy one of these things it s worth it,positive
this grater is fine when you can get it to work but most often the handle doesn t screw in correctly and you can t get it to it s mostly a waste of time though the concept is a great one i d recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one,negative
these are great knives especially for the price they are just like the pro s line from henckels only are not hardened the same way they are sharp the chefs knife sliced a very ripe tomato straight out of the box they have excellent weight and balance and the handles are comfortable all in all a great buy i can t believe i used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible definitely worth their weight in gold,positive
be aware before you order on oct 31 2006 i ordered two cases of bottles through amazon to be delivered from stacks and stacks when they arrived the cases were only 16 count instead of 48 count i called stacks and stacks and a supervisor was to return my call i received an email instead \( supervisor claimed my home number was a fax \) she offered to credit me shipping cost \( 18 47 for the heavier weight boxes the 16 count boxes are only 5 99 to ship \) if i wanted to keep the boxes otherwise they would arrange to pick them up she claimed that j k adams does not make a 48 ct case i responded that i wished to return the boxes \( i had less than half of the bottles i needed and the cost per bottle was now more than doubled \) i have since written two more times and as of 11 16 06 have received no response no instructions to return and no credit to my account i have filed a claim with amazon a z guarantee hopefully this will be resolved soon,negative
i bought one of these for my girlfriend then read the reviews in my opinion it appears to work fairly well the sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage to the far left seems to work best for normal walking as i said in terms of accuracy i think it s pretty good the radio portion of the unit is reason for the 4 out of 5 stars the sound is tinny it s not stereo there s no frequency disply and the super mini plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones \( earbuds \) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size though overall when comparing price to features this little fella will probably suit your needs if you already have a walkman \( or don t care about audio \) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet,positive
i thought this breadbox was beautiful in the picture and unique because of the two compartments the construction however is horrible the wood was split at the screw locations on the lid i returned the box and received another one the wood was split at the screw sites on the bottow of the second box it is very poorly put together and the material is cheap this certainly is not worth the price,negative
i bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills i thought this one seemed to have the better reviews so i bought it i really love it it heats up pretty quickly and has enough space for 2 3 people 4 people would have to eat slower but it does have enough broiler space and its square to have people at all 4 sides we use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal the only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say most of it comes off very easily but some spots of cooked grease remain it comes of with some elbow grease and a scrubby but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was,positive

i was a little hesitant to spend over 10 for a splatter screen as most of them really aren t worth more than a few bucks however i am very glad that i spent the extra money on this one the quality of this item is top notch it s much more sturdy than any others that i ve seen i ve been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it the feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes the handle is terrific \( some screens only have either a d ring on the top or a thin handle \) and seems to stay cool while in use this even got raves from my mother,positive
this color is a bit too bright but the bag it very comfortable,positive
my husband bought this for me for christmas 2005 i was thrilled to get it since i had an older smaller model i had never burned any food in a slow cooker before i used this model i couldn t figure out how to get it to cook slowly i finally called customer service and was told i wasn t using the right kinds of recipes she told me that the pot had to be at least 75 full i used her advice but it still boils everything on every temperature level i use it to make roasts and that is all it sweats horribly and i have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn t burn my countertop the handle cracked after 6 months my biggest ah ha moment was when i came home after a long day out there had been a power surge and it had reset itself my whole meal was ruined and that is when i realized the value of a dial knob slow cooker just back away slowly from this one,negative
the product is everything as described plus it stores alot of laundry and wheels easy,positive

i have made 3 batches with it and everyone has come out perfect just add the mix water and a packet of brewers yeast and even a small packet of baking yeast will work its easy no mess and you dont need to add any sugar unlike its lower priced ugly cousin mr beer the only recomenation i have is when you pour half of it with water then add the mix stir it untill almost disolved then add more water make sure its alittle warmer then room tempature alot of it will disolve then add the yeast and wait about 5 days then put it in the fridge for 10 and it will be perfect,positive

man this item is fantastic i love wasting 80 on pointless furniture getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems man i must be in heaven not only that but it breaks easily does this thing have no limit so i bought this great video center around a year ago and what happens it breaks i had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap it looks like you re in a baby kids room similar to those play centers in day cares or mcdonalds man that is lame i just love having children decor in my house and it has to be 80 if i were you i would just let my systems tv and cds sit in some tubberware believe me it would be 50x safer,negative
oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low i washed them once and they already shrank what is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton after i dry with them i have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin definitely a disappointing product even for its low pric,negative
i returned them beacause they are nothing like the good old revereware made in the u s a they are very thin and cheap i do not recommend anyone buying them you willonly want to return them,negative

have to disagree with the other reviewer here i purchased a baby biorb recently for my new betta after having my first betta living in an airless bowl for a couple years i simply got tired of cleaning a stinky bowl every week as a result i went shoppin for a new tank with a bubbler and filter system and found the baby biorb while i agree that the maintence costs are significant at 132 year \( if you need to change a filter every 4 weeks \) the costs balance with ease of maintenance personally my experience with cleaning the baby biorb was a snap with the optional suction hose took me fifteen minutes to clean the tank drain the grimey water and add new water couldn t have been much easier and i am not sure how anyone could have a problem swapping filter cartriges unless they have motor skills issues i also built a noise dampening box for the air pump my only real complaint is that the whisper quiet pump sounds like a mini jackhammer after about five minutes great product and looks awesome,positive
i was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son but when i took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper i have washed it several times but it is still very rough also the first time i washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed it was very cheaply made but my son does love it purely because its thomas i m sure i wouldn t buy this again,negative
i own reidel as well as spieglau the differences are slight the spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft feel to them is very good and given the price if i break one i don t get upset as i would with a reidel no wonder reidel bought the company i recommend the spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive well made glass at a moderate price anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more as these do deserve to be recommended,positive
there was no dimensions on the description so i took a chance it was a bit smaller than i thought \( about 2 5 cubic \) but that happens to work out perfectly for my purposes it is lovely and the color really adds to the kitchen my guests all loved it,positive

this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well but this one came out of the box warped the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy with only one strip through the center that made contact i could return it but for 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box i would never use it again,negative
i bought one of these in august of this year i used it daily to make a ham egg cheese english muffin sandwich every morning with great results however after about a month the non stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan i called back to basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days the new pan has been in use for two months without issue the people at back to basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle some people reviewing this product have complained about the stainless steel water boiler becoming dirty from minerals and scalded meat juice others have complained about the egg being soaked in water from steaming and or sticking in the pan i have overcome these problems by doing the following i bought a gallon of distilled water that i use in the water compartment \( at an ounce or two per use a gallon will last a long time \) this prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum \( keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum therefore speeding cooking time \) every three or four uses i wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down after cooking everything i remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water then remove the egg with the plastic fork i use store brand spray oil and have never had an egg stick in the pan i have found that if i want toast an english muffin a bagel to be pretty crispy i have to run it for two toaster cycles all in all this is a great product butter consumption in my house has decreased dramatically and i m not making a huge buttery mess on the stove every morning plus there no dirty spatula and frying pan to deal with every day,positive

just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back even on maximum setting it hardly toasts we tried different breads different settings and it just doesn t work right we even tried toasting \( on maximum \) one lot of bread \( not good \) and followed it by another lot of bread \( better but not adequate \) on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread forget it on the up side the toaster looks good but for 80 it should toast better than my old 9 99 black and decker,negative

the vacuum has great suction however suction is the only good quality about this vacuum i purchased this vacuum at sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale but i have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one the 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break the 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off this vacuum is hard to push you have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting on hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too this vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections the small compartment in the back of the dust cup is \( 1 high x 5 wide x 6 deep \) for the dirt the large front section collects the hair crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home however dirt and fine particulate dust is what i collect in my vacuum and hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter you spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet today i had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up i have tried kenmore eureka and fantom in the past i plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once i get my dyson i purchased from hsn,negative

after 3 1 2 years of pulling 4 to 8 shots of expresso per day and steaming hundreds of gallons of delicious foamy milk this little steam toy still works like new better than new actually because it has a better operator good results require a bit of experimentation with the variables of different grinds and quantities of coffee and durations of extraction i ve come home many times to discover that i d left the electric switch on all day but not to fear the thing doesn t burn up so far on other occasions i ve overloaded the pump by letting the reservoir run dry and then adding water to try to resume extraction through a filter that had become clogged from the interruption of the flow of water the pump keeps going even with the output blocked down to a trickle this will happen to you from time to time because you will neglect to refill the reservoir when it happens just start over with dry coffee you will also need to buy a small diameter tamper mine is 49mm the expresso liquor always has crema and never tastes sour to me even when using cheap brands of dark roast like eight o clock and community coffee everything i ve said about the brilliance of this machine is contingent howver on the coffee grinder without a good grinder you might as well just make drip coffee the secret good expresso in my experience is 25 expresso machine and 75 grinder a good grinder is the gaggia which i bought from amazon for 175 with a discount or the rancillio rocky which i would have gotten in the first place had i understood the importance of an excellent grinder this machine is small and light enough to take with you to the motel when you re on a road trip and cheap enough to leave behind if you forget to put it in your car the next morning my next expresso machine will be much more expensive but not because i m trying to obtain a higher quality brew my only reasons for paying more are to get double shots and the solenoid valve which will eliminate the spills of hot soupy grounds when emptying the porta filter also when you get familiar with the operation of a machine you d like it to last so you don t have to learn a new set of techniques,positive
somehow i stumbled onto this item while searching for quiet and fan now that i review the item description i don t see any mention of quiet oops the fan s primary flaw is that it only has two speeds both of which are insanely high i don t need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over heated workspace a gentle breeze would be great instead i have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado on the bright side perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight and then one day frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan i can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window thereby cooling the office naturally everyone wins also while the fan looks identical to the holmes fan pictured it is branded as a westpointe really westpointe with two e s,negative

this product was much better than i expected i have owned a cuisinart hand held mixer for over 10 years and it recently gave up the ghost \( too many cookies \) so in searching for a replacement i tried a kitchenaid mixer instead what a disappointment it didn t have the power i had experienced with my 7 speed cuisinart i didn t want to spend more money on another 7 speed \( and i couldn t find one locally \) so i decided to try the 3 speed figuring i would have to settle for a degrading in power surprise surprise the 3 speed is just as good if not better than my previous 7 speed and less than half the price i would definitely recommend this mixer good product and i have always found cuisinart s customer service people to be helpful when i have had to call,positive

i was excited when i read the great reviews for this product but i was very dissapointed when i received it i wanted this because i live in an apartment complex where i have to carry my laundry some distance to the laundry room i thought it would be great to just be able to wheel it over with this however when i tried to put it together out of the box \( it requires complete assembly \) though it is simple to put together not one of the small screws that hold the top bars on to the unit fit all four will go half way in and no further perhaps i got a faulty unit but i see it falling apart soon because of this also the bag itself seems flimsy i was also happy when i read that this rolls quietly however they must have been rolling it on carpet because out on the concrete walkway that leads to the laundry room it is extemely noisy i ended up carrying anyway so as not to disturb my neighbors the only thing this unit has going for it is it looks nice and holds a surprisingly large amount of laundry if you are just using this in your home it might work well for you but if you need to take it out to a laundry facility go with something else,negative

this was a seventh anniversaty gift and being made of copper is its only real benefit two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it s light and relatively shabby in construction it s difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper and to that end this fit the bill but its real value even for the intended purpose is very limited,negative

my pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind he jumps to pull the beas out of the hive he squeaks the beas perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head he went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it it is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads he likes the wing detail for chewing on this toy gives exercise i am so glad i tried it he plays with the hegehog on his own those are the 2 best toys the squirels from the hide a squirel are fun but the game holder is not something he was really excited about these interactive toys are great i have never seen such excitement and tail wagging he hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise this one is the best it is well worth 10 for a dog who loves to play i get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys,positive
i too have an electric stove i m glad others mentioned that cooks nicely cleans up easily absolutely love it great price too,positive

wow this speaker is fantastic it took a little time to get it setup but once we figured it out it worked like one of our top quality indoor speakers when i read the reviews i was hopeful but not sure now we love it and would recommend it to anyone we can use it in the font yard down by the swings and even in the basement \( which we did for our son s pirate brithdday bash \) please don t pass this up if you are in the market for an outdoor speaker this is great it may take a little time to set up but worth it enjoy,positive
this grater is not a convenience it s more of a punishment i have tried it for hash browns cheese chocolate etc i thought at first i was using it incorrectly but then realized there really is no wrong way of using this everytime i have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that i would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually my fingers and hands ache so bad that i can t even hold a pencil after using this gadget i would not recommend this to anyone unfortunately you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star but in reality i give it no stars,negative
both my fiance and i are very pleased with this warming mattress pad the dual settings work perfectly and the variety of heating intensities are excellent there is also extra emphasis on the feet a brilliant idea well worth the cost in my opinion,positive
this perch is a great size for a large cat or even two cats together it is soft and appears to be very comfortable however the way it attaches is by affixing a strip of velcro to your window sill which then mates with the matching velcro on the bottom of the shelf unit there are two adjustable legs that are supposed to give support as they brace against the wall my window ledges are not very deep and so the shelf does not sit level the legs are adjusted to fit as closely to the wall as possible however mine do not move close enough in so that the legs stay securely on the wall and therefore do not support the shelf properly we have tried putting a piece of folded cardboard under the part that sits against the wall but this hasn t worked either so unless you have very deep window ledges this may not work for you we bought two of these but plan on returning one on a positive note my cats love the shelf and took to it right away it is a great idea but this one needs a little better design,negative
i really made a mistake and bought 2 sets thinking i could always have extras ready i tried all types of grinds i packed loosely i packed firmly i packed tight i played and played still did not get a good cup of coffee finally threw them out just taking up space learned a lesson on buying quantity,negative
i loved these sheets when i first received them and would have written a glowing review then however now that i have washed them twice there is no sheen to them and every single inch on them is pilled they look terrible but i haven t slept on them yet since they pilled so i don t know how that will feel hopefully it won t be noticeable no one sees these sheets other than me and my husband but i am very disappointed with these considering i ve had cheaper sheet sets for 8 years that haven t reacted this way by the way i ordered the set in chocolate and it is a nice color if brown is what you want maybe it s possible that certain colors pill and some don t i have read other reviews that people said their sheets pilled also,negative

just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket it is rice we have prepared numerous times in another \( cheaper \) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop the rice that came out of the zojirushi was absolutely perfect as good as any i have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to china i was astounded none of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker just perfect plump fragrant rice the countertop stayed clean as well didn t bubble over with starch water like the other cooker clean up of the cooker was easy top notch excellent product you can t make better rice than what this thing produces,positive
this knife has made me eat more vegetables just because it s so much fun to chop carrots i was a little concerned with the handle at first but it s very comfortable and isn t slick at all even in soapy water i also worried that maybe i should have gotten the bigger version of this knife again my fears were unfounded as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation you can t really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job but if you ve ever had that feeling you already know how you ll feel using a global when i slice carrots for snacks they come out as perfect translucent discs any vegetable i ve cut has been a joy,positive
this rascal works great i put a half frozen bagel in it and it cut through no problem i would highly recommend it over a holder and knife,positive
we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone i built a knife holder to use in a drawer now with the wusthof 25 slot i have removed my home made holder the drawer can be used to store other items i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years there is no need to buy a lot of new knives just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use you can t go wrong with this super storage block,positive
i am usually very happy with hilfiger home products well these towels are run of the mill discount linen store quality there is nothing luxurious about them whatsoever i would expect to pay around 10 bucks for each they are not worth it i don t know what the heck kind of towels some of the other reviewers were using before they bought these,negative

this blender died after 4 months of light use i never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous i only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half frozen berries after two months the motor started to have that burned smell when i used it after three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack at four months the motor started making funny noises it smelled terrible and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use all in all this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash i will never buy a hamilton beach product again,negative
i can put up with the weight the noise the poorly located on off switch the spinning brush that is cool but doesn t work what i cannot put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on it will appear to be on correctly but if not the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction this creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister buy something else i can t wait for this one to die,negative
just a word of advice if your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up if they aren t it probably is not the toy for your dog at first my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy it took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was his once i finally got him used to realizing it was his own he saw me put his kibble in it then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it granted the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy s value now it is something that can occupy him for 20 25 minutes he ll do anything for treats although i m not sure that he really really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears i think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats i like interactive toys \) on the other hand our little dog still doesn t know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy just a guess he probably never will figure it out so some dogs will take to it and others will look at you like you re crazy for giving them a toy that doesn t squeak,positive
we now have the 4 2 gallon humidifer as well as the air softener all vornado and this one is most disappointing the construction is a bit flimsy but my biggest complaint is the area coverage the unit is supposed to support at least a 600 sq ft space we have it in our master bedroom which is smaller than this and the air still feels very dry in our bedroom even after we ve been running it for 2 days now non stop on the high setting granted i have a pretty heightened sensitivity to the moisture in the air in our bedroom given i have a cold and nasal congestion but i expected more from this unit given our satisfaction with the other we run the air softener on our 1st floor which covers several rooms and it definitely maintains a level of moisture there very well the 4 2 unit is in our basement which again covers several room and that one also has met our satisfaction we bought this because we needed one just for our master bedroom and we are pretty disappointed we have radiator heat and are suffering through the cold winter of chicago right now,negative
i thought this glass would be of better quality than it is it took 3 shipments \( re cieved and returned \) to get my complete order without any breakage these glasses are too fragile and in practice impractical because of the design one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass not too appealing when you are observing the legs of your wine recommend that you pass these by,negative

i am potty training my son so i needed a good waterproof mattress pad but didn t want to spend a lot of money this fits the bill it s lightweight but sturdy and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress and held up well in the wash so far has a nice feel and it doesn t seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do our mattress is old and thin by today s standards but the pad seems roomy enough that i think if we got a new thick mattress it would still work very pleased with this purchase,positive

light is beautiful and functional and so great for traveling but first led light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months too bad,negative
i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it s extremely poor design mr coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers first of all the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless it s a filter it s supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly otherwise the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter clogging the drain and then voila you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty grainy water all over your counters i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234,negative
i have found this to be the best i have ever owned my daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and i just had to have a bunn also i envied my daughter s ability to make coffee in literally three minutes i used to only have 12 cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now the best is that you can always have a fresh cup of coffee and it is always hot it makes a clean cup of coffee easily and efficiently we are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone this will be our brand of coffee maker forever,positive
i was disappointed when it arrived in pieces they didn t pack this well and i had to send it back i was impressed by the free return postage i do want this item and have requested another hopefully it will arrive in one piece this time then it might be worth more stars,negative

i really like the electric skillet it is the first one i have bought it is big enough to fry a chicken cut in half both halves at once and deep enough to make a stew easy to clean just like promised the only thing i was not so happy about was the handles they give a lot they bend and one of mine is already broken but that is really the only complain i have and i consider it a minor and would buy the skillet again,positive

i searched for months for a stylish durable set of flatware at a bargain price and this is it i was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a friday sale the design is unique and contemporary and the finish and weight are of excellent quality the only criticism that i have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher however this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come,positive
i recommend this product it is excellent quality very quiet when running and has lots of power,positive
these are my favorite cookers so much so i bought this one for my friend,positive

i purchased the eureka filter bags with the eureka upright boss 4870gz for my mom she loves them both the cord is really long on the vacuum which makes it easy to do several rooms at a time she lives in a one level ranch so she does not have to go up steps with it because she does find it a bit heavy beware the vacuum had to be assembled upon arrival i live out of state and she had to get another relative to help her assemble it the add never mentioned that small detail someone over 65 should not have to assemble a gift vacuum i bought the hoover wind tunnel 2 years ago for myself and it s a peice of garbage the lever to keep it upright broke the attachments fall off the hose when in use and everthing gets tangled on the roller i am thinking about purchasing the eureka soon for myself i reccomend it,positive

i recently purchased this set after spending several weeks trying to decide which set was right for me not a chef just a regular guy who likes to cook i looked at several competators and decided that for the price this set was the best one out there i ve had the opportunity to use most of the knives at this point and i find that they keep their edge very well and are extraordinarily easy to clean up they have a nice heft to them and the handles seem to be just the right size the only drawback that i see is that i would have preferred an 8 chefs knife instead of the 6 that comes with the set overall excellent for the price and an absolutely sufficient set for novice,positive
i ordered this griddle and on the third use the teflon coating burned off onto my glasstop stove i called faberware directly since i was out of my return period and after explaining my situation they sent me another \( different model \) griddle free of charge the first product didnt work out but the mfgr made good,negative
like many people i have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on despite talking to the neighbor politely and such they still have no concern for the noise pollution i was losing sleep and the barking was getting so bad that i even considered moving in desperation we looked online for something to stop barking dogs we came across viatek s super bark stop and decided to risk the money wow talk about being worth the money my husband affixed the device on a piece of wood and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard it s unsightly yes but we re the only ones to really see it more importantly it s right in line with the barking mutt the first time he tested it he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin we laughed gleefully could a good night s sleep actually be on the horizon it s been several days and super bark stop has worked amazingly the dog will lie as far as it can away from the device when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor s yard if it starts to yelp a little it stops almost immediately it s as if it s afraid to bark yay you can select the volume tone and number of barks to help eliminate false activation \( say from talking or loud bird squawking \) audible and inaudible both work fine but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting the device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 d batteries \( not included \) to operate it i am so thankful we found super bark stop my nerves were really getting jangled and i was dreading early mornings when they put the mutt outside it s amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are just because you may want a dog doesn t mean i want saddled with its noise while you neglect it p s after using bark stop for 2 weeks \( yes it did work \) we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more \( not as bad as before though \) we had it on silent and realized that it had stopped working apparently it s not 100 waterproof despite the claims of the manufacturer the person i bought it from said that once it s opened we find that it s not 100 waterproof well guess what you gotta open it to put the batteries in it either buy a faux bird house to protect bark stop or house it where it won t get wet otherwise you may find yourself in the same position we were in we got a refund and fortunately for us our neighbors got rid of their dog so we didn t bother getting a new one,positive
this item saves space because it folds everything to the same size it is god s gift to those of us who have small closets and hate messes i first saw it when a clerk at a store was using it to put clothes back on the floor for sale i tried to buy it off her and she told me the name of the company i love the flip fold you won t be sorry if you buy this item,positive
the amazon product picture makes these trays look like they produce square cubes and will therefore rest upon each other without spilling however the product one actually receives from bic superstore are trays that produce longer comma shaped ice and the trays themselves do not rest on each other at all the bottom of one tray freezes into the ice of the next so you get a frozen block of ice and trays all stuck to each other and impossible to crack apart without hot water these trays are a big mess they don t nest without spilling and don t be fooled by the and signs on the end of the trays no matter how you stack them they won t stack without spilling also bic doesn t share amazon s helpful return policy so buyer beware,negative

i got the expensive one rather than the 14 99 aroma cooker thinking it will be better quality wrong i only used it twice not only the rice get burn after i clean in and out of the cooker it still look dirty the quality of the material was really bad i think the store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement do not waste your good earned money on this one,negative
we had a rude awaking today our delonghi toaster was on fire i will never again buy any delonghi product the defective design is in the toast switch it is mechanical when it finishes toasting it sometimes continues to the always on position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast very very hot we literally had a house full of smoke a toaster full of flames you were warned funny thing is delonghi makes an attractive product sad thing is they can cost you your house or worse,negative

i bought this unit because the humidity in my apartment on extremely dry days and nights was 15 20 the air o swiss 7135 was rated top by every web site i visisted and researced before buying this product it is also rated to work in rooms up to 600 square feet and the biggest room in my apartment is less than 500 well to summerize hygrostat consistently says 25 even though my bedside hygo says 15 the best i can get out of this machine is 30 humidity according to my own hygostat as the one built into the unit does not move past 25 the above situation is in the smallest room in my home which is 170 square feet so the 600 square feet rating is totally not true to close please be ware that this unit does not work for extremely dry apartments and homes like mine the other reviews must be in homes that are already at 30 40 humidity this is not worth the money you pay for it i will try running it non stop for a few days to see if it helps but if not then this unti will be going back,negative
i opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around i promptly called amazon and they replaced it it was a waste of money the first time i washed them white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out i was very very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again don t waste your money,negative

i just received this griddle today and am so disappointed to find on the small print on the box \( and not in amazon s description \) that this griddle can not be used on ceramic top stoves it s a beautiful piece of cookware heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges exactly what i wanted but very unfortunate that amazon doesn t tell you that it won t work with some stoves the warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top probably would have given it 5 stars if i could have used it,positive
we had this less than 10 months and used only two of three ultimate filters we purchased separately that s how little use this pitcher got started leaking everywhere one day and i couldn t figure out what had happened i thought i hadn t put the innards back in right after changing the filter but in the end i decided either a seal or a seam failed i m not the first person to report the leaking problem with minimal use so i believe it is a design or manufacturing flaw what a waste of a good 60 with the additional three filters purchased while it worked we loved its sleek design how much water it held and how great the water tasted that s why it gets the two stars i gave it too bad it turned out to be a piece of junk i see the item is now not available here at amazon and i guess that means someone monitored the returns or complaints about the product and made changes or pulled the item from sales rotation what i want to know is when we will be notified by pur about the problem and given coupons or rebates because of it if you sent in your warranty card or registered the product online there is no reason pur couldn t offer somehting in exchange for their poorly designed item mine s now in the trash where it belongs don t buy one if you are considering it go with a good quality faucet mounted or under sink mount filtering system and you will be glad you did despite the more expensive price,negative
i placed a substantial order mattresses sofa set table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was too much nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio,negative
i hate to rate something so low but my experience warrants a low score the larger burner was defective from the onset the knob turned but the burner remained on and at full it seemed regardless of the knob s setting i had to unplug and plug in the unit to turn it off and on the smaller burner worked amazon was nice enough to refund me in full and even paid for the return shipping as well packing seemed fine too guess it was a manufacturing defect hopefully this doesn t happen to many others,negative
this product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic amazingly it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer \( just a thin cardboard box with no padding \) the only real gripe i have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper the hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side this does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities one of the reasons why i picked this particular product in the first place if it were not for the flawed lid i would have given this product a five star rating,positive

i have some nice nonstick cookware that i needed whisks for so i got these my main reasons for choosing them were the brand and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone rather than silicone coated steel unfortunately that is not the case this is silicone coating metal this is acceptable though because the 5 year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off and 5 years of cookware safe whisking for this price is worth it to me the whisk is wonderful and i d recommend it to anyone just don t believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above,positive

it seemed to work when i first got it but i m not really sure anymore when i first got it i changed the litter and put the smellkiller right near it usually after i change the litter i can still smell the litter it just smells clean this time i couldn t smell anything i keep the sponge moist and it still sits in the small area where the litter box is for the most part i don t notice any smells but i m not sure if that is due to the smellkiller or because i use a h baking soda kitty litter a 2nd litter with crystals and the a h litter box deodorizer powder i suppose it works ok but i wouldn t buy another one and i don t think it works the miracles claimed in other reviews also mine didn t stay on the wall either came crashing down only 1 day after i put it up now it just sits on top of the litter box,negative

for many years i had a presto pressure cooker but when the sealing ring didn t work a few years back i tossed it out thinking i could never get a replacement ring i missed having that pot i m glad to have one once again stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one but tonight will be spare ribs the new pot is nothing like my 30 year old one it works the same in the end though i would have opted for the aluminum as that was what i had but my husband bought the stainless steel i don t think it makes a difference for the price except in appearance,positive

i loved this vacuum initially you can even see how much dirt it s picking up however the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately to where the vacuum won t pick up a speck of lint you ahve to empty the filter every 5 10 minutes i do not have a terribly messy household just one with no stairs going to the front backyard,negative
i have several other pieces in this collection which i absolutely love when i was able to find the salad server set at amazon com for a cheaper price i couldn t wait to order it when it came i was more than disappointed the set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished \( which it is not supposed to ever do \) or someone had bought it tried to clean it with a polish \( again something that is not supposed to be done \) and it wore away the finish i also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set and when that came it was all scratched needless to say i returned both for a full refund immediately obviously the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case and it wasn t dirt cheap to begin with i still had paid 75 00 for it compared to 150 00 that it is sold in stores for,negative

i purchased these sheets together with the pike street 800 thread count sheet set as they were being offered as a combo special made on the page if you wanted to order the 800 thread count sheets which i did and i cannot tell you how thrilled i am with both sets of sheets if you can still get them both together \( amazing price \) you should you will not be disappointed at all they are both very well made wonderful to sleep on i have an 18 thick mattress and they fit perfectly my husband and i love good quality sheets and we both highly recommend these the few wrinkles that you may find after they come out of the dryer should in no way affect your decision to buy these wonderful sheets and miss out on this sheer elegance i mean after all you deserve it you are worth it so go for it for my husband and i an incredible nights sleep in total comfort priceless,positive

i purchased this fryer after the death of our previous deep fryer thinking you get what you pay for so i splurged yes i read the reviews which had a lot to do with my decision to purchase this particular fryer mistake no one explains that the plug is extremely short or the fact that the magnet holding this heavy cord has a difficult time keep it plugged into the fryer the temperature doesn t seem to stay consistent as my previous fryer yes i know that adding food to the oil will reduce the temp after only 6 months with average use of once per month it s dead bewar,negative
i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best only problem is that they rust i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior i don t imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so but any serious tea drinker like me knows that s unrealistic i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn t last long at all i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i m officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot,negative
i would rate this zero but that option is not available the weight of the stainless steel is heavy exactly what i had expected for 18 8 however the top does not affix to the base it seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base furthermore the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base that s worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter yuck i do not recommend the purchase of this product,negative
my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old over the years we have tried allergy shots dietary changes and prescription ointments all costing a fortune we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears i can keep her clear this stuff is great and at 1 2 the price of prescription and no vet charges i m happy to keep it on hand,positive
i purchased this through amazon but returned it i intended to use this with their 3qt 10 inch saute pan but it is huge it is not an elegant design for this size pan all clad should have designed a screen that matches this pan instead of a one size fits all from 8 inches to 13 inches furthermore the unique handle that curves over the screen takes more storage room my wife didn t like it back to the drawing boards all clad,negative

don t buy this fan unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed also if it has green lights \( like my blizzard fan did \) it will light up a dark room at night also you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling low speed is quiet enough for sleeping but high will disturb you the angle tilt adjustments are not precise and are difficult to do there are better choices,negative

i have loved every le creuset product i have purchased with the big exception of the whistling teakettle i did away with it a couple of months ago and bought the brittany model to replace it the whistling kettle burned my hand on several occasions as the design of the spout allowed the hot water to spit and jump right out of the pot the whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat the water would still jump from the spout while a little larger than i would have liked the brittany does not have the same problem and the whistle can be safely flipped up before pouring i have been very pleased with my new kettle and would recommend the brittany by far over the whistling,negative
got one as a christmas present great concept but the performance falls well short of the promise as another reviewer noted wine from my wine fridge \( 56 deg \) registered as 74 deg when placed into the unit wine at room temp \( 72 deg \) regularly registered 78 deg or so although the unit ran through it s cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was in fact if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier i tried about half a dozen times over a couple days but it never worked properly we returned the unit to the store for credit,negative

this is a wonderful item that your cat will love i originally purchased a thermal mat from another website \( more expensive with a pattern that i didn t like \) my 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it so i did a search and when i found this one i ordered one for each of them this cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that i just ordered 3 more for my dad sister and a friend to give to their cats i ve seen similar thermal cat mats for 50 the pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux sheepskin my cats like both sides you can throw them in the washing machine and fur doesn t stick to the smooth patterned side which is nice of all of the cat beds i have purchased including a heated window mounted bed that plugged into the wall this mat is my kitties favorite thing to sleep on,positive
we too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned we already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem now a month after using the new one its espresso pump is loud and noisy sounding like its broken also for some reason or another it won t send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso it ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out but then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine its been going for the last couple of days but its such a iffy thing on the plus side it does look nice and it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work my husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow but he says that about everything,negative

this little franciscan apple dinnerware creamer is so beautifully made there is a matching sugar bowl and lid too i do not use mine to hold cream or half and half on an everyday basis because i would have to keep it covered with saran wrap so the liquid would not absorb any refrigerator odors however i do love to use it when i use my franciscan apple coffepot or when entertaining at a dinner party there is also a small milk jug and there are two other larger pitchers in the apple pattern i have also used the apple creamer as a server for sauces,positive

i baked six loaves in this machine i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don t turn out just right my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time \( 70 minutes \) my loaves were only marginally acceptable they were not sufficiently baked i was using a nearly whole wheat recipe the machine was quiet strong and had a lot of bells and whistles but with only partially baked bread i had to return it to amazon amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back and were quick enough with the refund,negative
this is a nice product it gets the job done i have to disagree with the one reviewer the description plainly states that the board is made of polyethylene the midnight granite signifies the color for 9 99 14x17 is a great price,positive
for big birds rib roasts etc you need a long knife to get a clean even slice this knife delivers it has great lines and a ballanced feel the forged blade is thin and flexible yet still drives from the handle the blade follows your directions well and doesn t wander during a cut a real gem with top quality construction i m a big fan of three rivet durability but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that i chose them for the last three knives i purchased blade for blade these knives are the best around at this price you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years,positive
as a person who loathes cheap clutter infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would be returned the same day this opener is large requires an electric plug and takes up counter space but to my surprise it works amazingly well there is a foil cutter that is stored in the base the screw enters cleanly and seems to eliminate broken and shredded corks which can be frustrating hold the button again and the cork emerges from the device and drops out i always liked my sturdy and simple stainless steel opener but this turned out to be a keeper it s design is contemporary and clean although it looks like it should do something more profound than just pull a cork it s also a conversation piece provoking smiles from guests a pleasant surprise highly recommended and especially so for a person who lacks hand or wrist strength,positive

i was very disappointed in this item i own the farberware 8 quart pot that this insert is supposed to fit inside but when i set the insert into the pot it didn t fit the insert handles which are plastic sit on the metal side of the 8 quart pot \( that can t be good \) and the little feet on the insert may or may not touch the bottom of the pot the ridge around the insert which i assumed would hold the insert in place in the 8 quart pot don t fit on any part of the farberware 8 quart pot has farberware changed the diameter of their classic 8 quart pot if i was trying to fit a non farberware item into my farberware pot i would have had no complaints but my 8 quart pot and the 8 quart insert were both farberware classic pieces believe it or not i had a cusinart pot which the insert fit i e the ridge held the insert in place so i ll use it with that pot but the insert sits some three inches above the bottom of the cuisinart pot so when i cook the boiling water seeps over very very disappointing if i d bought this item from a local store i would definitely have returned it,negative

we love the omega paw litter boxes to death but when we got our first two we ordered these so we could have cute little matching sets and looking back we really should have spent that money to get a third box our cats don t like the paw cleaning side they refused to walk on it so we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor we leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those but our new boxes are doing fine without them the cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves you might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws but don t buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it,negative
the fan does work fairly well as an intake fan however in exhaust mode \( the mode i need \) i can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit it simply doesn t work as an exhaust fan therefore to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2 470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan i m returning it by the way the packing slip from air n water states that a 15 restocking fee that applies to all returns i am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with air n water if they try to hit me with a restocking fee,negative

i was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price i was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion this set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand although this set comes with a sharpener i recommend getting the w sthof 2904 knife life knife and scissor sharpener you will not need to sharpen these knives much but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house i also recommend as others have to never place these knives in the dishwasher also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use this will drastically increase their longevity if you purchase these and i propose you do so then get a travel roll bag for knives this is because you will want to take them to friends and family s homes to show them off,positive
i see a lot of people have leaky shakers not me mine is absolutely perfect the top strainer piece fits snugly leak free requiring just the right amount of effort to de couple it from the canister the design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister the lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top the cap jigger also fits perfectly with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily,positive
i like this pan because of the tapered shape it cooks sauces without boiling over because it is tall and it sits perfectly on the small burner with no overlap for even heating the handles stay cool and the clean up is easy beautiful exterior also like all all clad products this pan is worth the money long lasting and well designed the only thing i wish all clad would add is hash marks on the interior so i could see when i have reduced a sauce to half,positive
these colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys they are treated with catnip but to be honest i don t think my cat knows the difference unlike their zanies furry mice counterparts zanies rainbow mice also rattle since they have tiny pebbles inside them a word of caution about this though the pebbles are encased inside a semi rigid plastic cartridge \( which makes up the body of the mouse \) the furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued after my cat played with one of the mice the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed since there are pebbles inside unsupervised play might not be very safe it s best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them other than that these are great toys and the price quantity quality ratio is pretty good quantity is important here because due to their small size most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture since you get 60 mice in this package you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action in the long run it s a lot cheaper than buying them individually,positive
although this item s description says it is made of commercial quality stainless steel it arrived with several rust spots so much for whatever commercial quality stainless steel means also be aware that the handles are not round but are u shaped it is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush on the positive side the locking mechanism seems to work well and i do like the non stick silicone tips however on the whole i would not recommend these locking tongs,negative
the spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove the food does not fall through the slots it is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying it is good for dipping out food out of dishes also the only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when i received it it didn t hurt the function of the spatula it is a great tool to have in the kitchen,positive

it s noisy and expensive you can get that from reading the other reviews on this page ours stopped working within 2 weeks of light use i called the company and when i described the problem they said it was a faulty unit thankfully the store let me return it and i got my money back we have bought the hamilton beach trueair 04381 allergen reducer air cleaner which is cheaper smaller and very quiet most importantly it works,negative

there is a clear echo here so to simply quote the experience of another reviewer after two months the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead rather than paying to ship the unit to krups myself clearly the company cannot afford to pay shipping on the thousands of these cheaply made units i hauled the krups fnp112 42 down to my workshop and found that the hose to the steamer had detached well fixing that problem did not render the fnp112 42 usable for now it simply exhaled steam in great plumes like a bull in a bugs bunny cartoon cleaning the unit per the directions from krups did nothing whatsoever nor did shaking it robustly or inserting various instruments into the nonworking nozzles serve any purpose but at least i felt a bit better turns out the only thing getting steamed was me i m going to buy a good espresso maker this year for christmas and i can promise you that it will not have the word krups emblazoned on it,negative

i don t know about the other reviews that say this knives aren t stainless steel the labels fall off or the filet knife breaks but what it s for sure in my case is that these knifes work great i don t go by fanciness nor brandy items i want knives that cut nice and easy and the miracle blade iii are the best it s true if you love your things just follow what says in the instructions manual don t dish wash your knives because in addition that they rust they start to reduce their original sharpness even more any knife will reduce their original sharpness no matter what the manufacturer says do not wash knives in the dishwasher or hand wash them with hot water all of my knives preserve their labels and looks like new and i use them on a daily basis once again it s a matter of following instructions my filet knife is in perfect condition common sense don t do everything what the infomercial shows don t bend the filet knife to verify that the guy on the infomercial s testimony is right this knife cuts beautifully without too much bending finally i own this set of knives for two years and a half and they still cut as good as the first day i received them by mail i live in colombia south america where this product is not too cheap so i had to think several times before i decided to make the call today after two years and a half i don t regret of making that call and i am very happy cooking with my miracle blade iii knife set furthermore i do recommend this knife set to anyone just follow instructions that s all,positive

after failing to find a simple easy to use travel clock in local stores i decided to search online and got this one even though it s inexpensive the craftmanship isn t shoddy all the parts fit together well and are easy to adjust parts of it glow in the dark \( including the hands number marks and pop up part that lets you know that you set the alarm \) it s very quiet and doesn t take up much space if only more things in life were like this great little clock,positive

this krups toaster is the best i have ever used perfect toast every time the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife the defrost function works great if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices the crumb tray slides out easily eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster all in all the best toaster i have ever owned,positive

i ve own my x3 for about 2 years now and overall it has been used to make one double espresso daily so when it stopped working a month ago i was heartbroken called ff after some back and forth i sent the machine in for repair the cost of repairing it is about 200 incl the shipping add that to the 499 i paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine after several days of back and forth with customer service i still don t know what exactly is not working in my machine apparently there are 3 items that have failed one being the thermostat a washer and something else that cs was unable to explain i really liked the machine when it was working so i gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair but at the end decided against it i rather purchase a new rancilio silvia when i called the cs with me decision and asked them to send the machine back i was told that on top of the 12 shipping there will be a 13 handling charge for packaging the machine i refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty long story short i finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge but that was one very unpleasant experience it is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight i had with them i really liked the x3 when it was working and i would love to have it back but it is just not cost effective at all what is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance i provided it has 3 parts needing replacement if this was a good quality machine it should have worked a lot longer without any problems,negative
this fan is an excellent value for its price it gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds additionally it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level i bought this fan because my old one had died in the middle of a hot summer this one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room the only reason that i did not give this fan a rating of 5 is because it has begun to hesitate when it swings to the right this has happened to other similar fans i have had but not so soon after purchase if you re mechanical you can probably correct the problem by yourself i do recommend this fan for anyone and any place oh did i say the remote is perfect because i am handicapped it saves me from getting up and down too often,positive
i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it it ticks but the bell doesn t ring at the end also i was disappointed in it s packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere,negative

although i have used this model before and have all good results the one i bought for christmas did not work jura capresso states that they test their machines before they leave the factory they might have tested mine and it may have worked but all it did for me was spit out hot water underneath the tray i tried different grind settings but to no avail water flowing out the bottom of the machine too bad as this was a gift for all of my family imagine the look on their faces when all they got was water dripping onto the floor,negative
i have sold a number of this style timer made by kitchenaid in pink black and white almost every buyer complained all complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room have a fan on or are listening to the tv or radio replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either if you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the red black blue white or tangerine ones that are entitled digital timer with rotating dial no one has any complaints over this style of kitchenaid timers,negative

my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo 10 air popper i saw this one and thought what a great idea and bought it on the spot i hadn t read the reviews here when i did my heart sank although some people did rate it high and said it was great sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true slow popping with small kernals it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model it s simply too slow and requires a breather it was returned yesterday,negative

this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well the fan is very quiet i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright too bright for a bedroom really lights it up i ll be looking for some way of safely masking it otherwise very nice but hope it lasts,positive

we bought a well reviewed carpet vacuum from amazon last year and absolutely love it after that positive experience we were looking for something for our kitchen bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner starting with the dry vac part that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine but anything cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back which would be fine but if you lean it back too far there is a suction filter thing \( made for the wet vac part \) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue anyway the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well but if any of you have small children \( we have 3 boys under 6 \) don t have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes now onto the wet vac part which was the main reason we got this very disappointing we used the included cleaner warm tap water etc as the directions indicated and both my wife and i swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started it doesn t look cleaner shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean spills or stains that normally take 1 3 passes with a mop are taking 8 12 passes with this machine we bought this to save time and or get cleaner floors and i can honestly say that this machine did not do either as briefly noted above if you have children do not expect clean floors out of this and i can t recommend this at all this product may be suitable for people who have no children no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic i just know this isn t our house,negative
back in the mid 1980 s i bought a patton 14 inch high velocity fan although this fan i am reviewing uses the same name it is not at all nearly as good as the original the original actually had three different speeds while this one uses three speeds they are hardly distinquishable from each other the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version the original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version oh yes the original s lowest speed was actually quiet whereas none of the speeds on this new version is quiet bad substitute and mediocre fan,negative

i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best only problem is that they rust i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior i don t imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so but any serious tea drinker like me knows that s unrealistic i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn t last long at all i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i m officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot,negative
yes it sits in my drawer and that s all it s only useful if you have a real dread of trace garlic aroma on your fingers instead i cut off the base of the garlic with a widish knife then put the flat side of the knife on the garlic and whack it with my fist it s so much quicker and easier the skin comes off no problem plus crushing garlic releases more flavour than merely slicing it,negative

i find it more than a bit ridiculous that pur charges 40 dollars for their product and 20 25 dollars for their replacement filters i have owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use why because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse removing and reinstalling the unit does not help i have become so frustrated by pur water products that i will never again purchase anything made by them i just installed a brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the brita is more reasonably priced at up to 15 dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit do yourself a favor and avoid this over priced piece of junk at all costs,negative

i have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it it will overflow very frustrating as we like strong coffee because ours has overflowed so many times the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it won t hold water i ll never buy this frogware again,negative

as a le creuset cast iron fan it was only natural that one day i would try out their stoneware products while maintaining the same color options and increasing their product offerings i still prefer the cast iron products over the stoneware even so there are times when the stoneware fits a need the cast iron cannot effectively fulfill the stoneware is not intended for use on the stovetop besides this the stoneware can go from the oven microwave to the table and then to the refrigerator virtually non porous le creuset s stoneware is fired at 2156 degrees making it resistant to chipping cracking and staining the enameling results in an easy to clean and scratch resistant surface and will not absorb odors or flavors and resists moisture absorption this line is sure to perform for many years the stoneware line has many of the same qualities the cast iron line is known for this pie dish can be used for ice cream pies crisps cobblers pies shepard s pie tamale pie or any other number of dishes pros fits a need le creuset s cast iron line sometimes cannot same high quality standards found in le creuset s cast iron line but lighter weight made to last for many years cons not intended for use on the stoveto,positive
i normally don t write reviews but after owning several toasters in the past and being very disappointed i just had to write about this one i owned an old toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years it never did brown evenly but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke got my money s worth i have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions amazon and others and many people haven t been very happy with toasters they have bought costing nearly 300 00 \( dualit \) toastmaster ge rival dualit most kitchenaid and sunbeam models were poorly rated i found one review on this sunbeam \( this is their top of the line model the chrome and black model costs more but currently not in production \) and the person really really liked it so i ordered this from amazon directly this was the very lowest price i could find order something else so as to get their free shipping \( over 25 00 \) so what happened when i got it got the toaster plugged it in dropped two slices of bread in and excitedly waited for my toast a few minutes passed then pop its done or so i thought when the toast came out it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted this goes for both slices right then and there i was ready to send this thing back well had been busy that week and continued using it day after day each day was as disappointing as the first then after a little over a week the bread started toasting uh well perfectly after owning this for nearly 4 months it still browns evenly on both sides of each piece of bread crisp on the outside soft on the inside i don t know why it started working right wouldn t think that it would need to be broken in to work right i am so glad that i didn t send this back right after the first several toastings procrastinating worked out in my best interest for the first time i have not tried bagels in this don t like bagels but it does well for what i bought it for i think the style is rather funky but many people have liked its looks if this toaster works for you as good as it has for me i think you will like it if it doesn t work well right out of the box you might give it a few days maybe the toast fairy will bless you too,positive
i had all but given up hope on electric can openers until i bought this one you can tell when you pick it up that it s of good quality \( not cheap plastic junk \) the removeable head is also very solid heavy duty and washes easily in the dishwasher the black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter as well i m a believer again in electric can openers,positive
this little gadget is simple cheap but you d have to spend a lot more money to get a cup of coffee out of an electric coffee maker of the quality you get using this get some really high quality coffee beans grind em at home use about one and a half scoops into your paper filter \( using a small gevalia type scoop \) take about 3 minutes \( or less \) to slowly pour your boiling water over the coffee grounds and you ll have a truly satisfying cup of hot coffee right up there with french press quality of flavor but hotter i ve used the same beans in my krups moka brew and they tasted awful then made the coffee using this and it made a really flavorful cup of coffee highly recommended you try this before spending beaucoups of dollars on the high end coffee brewers of course if you re serving entertaining folks you ll need your standard coffee brewer but for making great restaurant quality coffee one cup at at time this is a nice little product to have,positive

the english take their toast seriously and while i don t share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams sonoma for years about seven years ago when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound i bought the 2 2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about 100 less than the then going us price while it s a bit dicey fitting thick cut bagels into the slots \( not a big bread item in the uk \) i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them the toasting is even and i actually the enjoy the old fashioned timer without pop up which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled unlike others i do not unplug it after each use never had a problem the crumb tray is terrific and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess i ve had the 100 krups and cuisinart models which burned out within two years this one is made for restaurant use and i expect it to last a lifetime worth every penny if you appreciate high end kitchen appliances and tools,positive

after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one it has been great and i couldn t ask for anything better or more easy to use i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross odors or tastes my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated cleanup is easy also after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be i would recommend this with no caveats,positive
this is a significant improvement over the 750 model the 750 model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the 760 to replace that the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed,positive

until a week ago i d have given this coffee maker four stars because it has brew strength control last week though the clock face turned entirely black and this morning the unit completely malfunctioned the shut off alarm sounded after only an hour but when i went into the kitchen to salvage the last of the coffee i discovered the unit was still on draining the pot i attempted to shut the unit off manually and it kept coming back on i finally got it shut off and 10 minutes later it turned itself back on again after unplugging it the unit went into the trash i strongly suspect steam was able to get into the mechanism causing the electronics to short circuit obviously it is a fatal design flaw or a clever ploy to force people to buy more coffee makers in all it lasted about eight months,negative

other than the look which has now been duplicate by other companies there is absolutely no reason to buy this incredibly expensive toaster it does not toast evenly it does not accomodate bagels unless you flatten the bagel into a pancake with a hole in it everything is manual and has to be reset every time including how long the toast cooks and whether you heat the elements for one slice or two the idea that the toaster keeps your toast warm after it s done toasting is false the toast is barely warm and as you d expect once you think about it dried out the dual lit is all hype no better functioning than a 30 toaster from sears \( or amazon which is the best place to do business in the world,negative

it s a three piece roasting rack two sides and a long pin that holds them together when assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles it s supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey and after using it with a 22 lb turkey i believe that claim the tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do in fact my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our maxam steel roaster which is currently my favorite roasting pan the truly cool thing about this rack however isn t the handles or the shape it s that nifty pin at the bottom you see you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin then you simply remove the sides that s it they pull right away from the turkey leaving it behind on its platter no more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack it s right where you want it already for all of its non stick properties the rack did take some real elbow grease to clean particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars but that isn t very surprising it does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product however also there is one problem that did bother us it seems that some of the non stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking we thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 f was too high a temperature for the rack but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that i could find i m still giving this item a rating of four because it s just so incredibly cool an idea and so remarkably useful but i have to admit that i m not thrilled with the idea of a non stick coating that flakes and i wish the item was dishwasher safe i d love to see cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material,positive

cute bookshelf looks goods and serves its purpose however the tips of it that screw together break really easily we were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week it only lasted through 3 shows two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use and no weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing probably would work well if you never plan to take it down but i d question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time,negative
i used to like my viking 512mb cf card a lot i had such a card for more than a year in that period i used it in my camera it s filled up for several times also occationally i use a card reader \( simpletech \) to write read that card to transfer some big files between computers it s all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading i got cf card error on my camera fortunately after i delete a few pictures i could move on i gave the card to other people so i don t know how it s doing now after that i purchased another viking 512mb half year ago i used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet now i am getting consistent cf card error message on my camera even after re format for several times while i don t have that problem if i use another card one theory i heard was that a card reader may damage a card i can not verify though anyway i will have to buy another card now and it won t be viking for this time one month later i contacted with their customer support they gave me a number for return and i mailed back my damaged cf card they sent back a new one in a week the new one is working fine so far the exchange was not difficult they did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt they only verified the serial number that s good,negative

i bought this for my wife i have an iriver hp120 which i consider to be one of the best ever made i have to say i think this is a great little player the interface is well designed the unit is well made and the sound quality is excellent i purchased a u2 about 1 year ago as a gift which was also excellent i think cowon is making some of the better mp3 players on the market now and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality unit,positive
this armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen \( stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector \) it works well for jogging and working out the neoprene \( better than leather for sweaty workouts \) armband fits well on my upper arm \( 6 200lb \) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms it is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place i first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so i now just clip it in which seems to work fine it has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but i think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband i have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and i am satisfied at this point i am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included also on another note apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors i have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception the button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly all in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it s a solid value,positive

i tested this along with the neuros mpeg4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the neuros the picture with the sandisk is very pixelated especially with fast action sports like football and basketball the sandisk does have a better interface and is easier to understand and set up quickly but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor fyi i m using a psp as my viewer,negative
received the product it was not fully functional the buttons worked but the mouse would not track i loaded the software trouble shot everything even put up with maddeningly insane questions from kensington tech support \( did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in \) however amazon com was very quick and gracious in the return remarking on the design seemed to fit well in my hand though it was a bit bulky usb cord was very long a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly i m a bit disappointed i was always a fan of kensington products starting with the 90s trackball i also have a cordless optical notebook mouse i ve been seeking a replacement b c it chews through batteries like none other so far i am 0 2 on satisfaction with kensington mice,negative
how often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century nobody is moving and you can tell it s going to be a while it would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you re stuck but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation this inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car just like a wall outlet no worries work off your car s alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment,positive
i installed this unit on my hp amd 64 x2 with a 19 inch lcd monitor installation was very straightforward with no problems experienced the unit has two rows of power outlets eight outlets total all are surge protected but only one row has battery backup each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets the unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line and interacts well transparently my dsl service the unit comes with a usb connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer also included is powerchute personal edition software this software replaces the ups option used under the power icon of widow s xp control panel powerchute pe allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user s needs powerchute pe automatically loads at computer startup and resides as an icon on the right side of the window s task bar it monitors the unit s status and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference in order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly i only attached the pc and monitor to the powered row of outlets transformers seem to use a lot of power and to gain the most time available for adequate shut down times they should only be plugged into the surge only outlet row when a c power fails the unit immediately picks up the power load it will then begin to shut down the pc if a c power does not become available shortly the default method it uses is to place the pc into hibernation mode saving the desktop exactly as is for future start up it accomplished this task with my pc perfectly if i had wanted a ups to keep my computer running for several minutes during an a c power outage this is not the unit i would have purchased however to keep my system from re booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily or to shut down the pc safely should the power outage last longer this is a cost effective solution for those tasks,positive

i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it s biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an abc book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use,positive
i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it 4 s and 5 s so i expected a lot out of them the truth is you really shouldn t they don t sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to 30 00 after shipping and stuff the mid highs and highs sound fine but i had issues with bass and mid low response especially when i plugged it into my computer plus they are not super comfortable either the hinges nip at your neck when you don t have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses all in all i wished i had spent my money on something else but they do look pretty cool,negative

i bought this product mainly for my girlfriend to use on my computer i find myself using it most of the time now the mouse is great lost of extra buttons on it \( not that i need them but it makes it a little more convenient in case i do \) the keyboard is great lots of shortcut buttons right on the keyboard making navigation very easy a couple of features on the keyboard i really like are the scroll whell on the left the favorites buttons \( all customizable as are all the shortcut buttons on this keyboard \) and the very comfortable hand rest i got this refurbished and it works like new i highly suggest this the only drawback is that it is a little bigger than i would have liked but i don t mind it nearly as much as my girlfriend if that s not a problem i highly suggest this product,positive
this was my second netgear product i bought \( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed \) the idea of a network storage appeals to me but this drive just is not good in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well but that is where everything started to go down hill midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages \( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors \) and suddenly my computer reboots figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot tried again same thing happens started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 you need to look in to your own computer to quote netgears web site scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives many newer computers use promise sata drivers my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers back in the box the sc101 goes and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and none work this is where i get really frustrated netgear support i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i d have to pay to have that cr p yes he said it from my system i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill i have to pay to get this junk off my computer way to support your products netgear the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again i was freaked that this person knew my home address all in all this is a great concept after reading up on it and now experiencing it i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market maybe by a company with better customer service it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer,negative

like the name suggests the m audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first however when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496,positive

we now have three of the k850 printers in use one with a built in print server second paper tray and duplexer so far the printers have proved to be reliable fast and comparatively inexpensive to operate power on pre print and post print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer capable of using the same hp 10 black and hp 11 individual color ink cartridges as well as replacement print heads as the hp business ink jet 1100d and hp business ink jet 1200d the k850 shares the same low per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph white horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads shipped with the new printer are defective the printer handles paper sizes up to 13 x 19 so it easily handles b size \( tabloid 11 x 17 \) paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters the printer software installs without problem although a reboot will likely be required for network capable k850 printers the software install automatically finds k850 printers on the network and adds a hp standard tcp ip port to the computer configuration for communication with the printer for non network capable k850 printers both usb and parallel port connections are supported positives uses ink that is compatible with other printer models helping to keep operating costs down fast printing for full page color and even faster black printing with spot color large format color printing which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced printing stops automatically user replaces ink cartridge and printing continues separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges heads after ink cartridge replacement larger capacity ink cartridges and lower operating cost negatives minimal install of hp software from the cd requires at least 100mb low capacity hp 13 print cartridges ship with the printer power on pre print and post print noise just like the business ink jet 1100d and 1200d however there is very little noise produced while printing cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges similar to that used on the 1200d large footprint,positive
this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment,negative

let me start by saying i was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going i imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up or find them if we got lost \( or god forbid worse \) i bought two from amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the amazon order to arrive i took my girlfriend s niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked five minutes later mine locked up i went and found my niece uncle xxxx why does the screen look all funny the units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up so i exchanged them but then so did the two i got in exchange i thought perhaps i got a bad batch from the local store but when the amazon units arrived they had the same problem we took them out for a stroll with some friends from mba school the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers dude these forget locating the people in your party even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks \( i should know i was so excited when i ordered the radios that i applied immediately for a gmrs license with the fcc \) the rino 530 s simply don t work well a combined gps and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product but at 400 a unit they are pathetic 1600 for four units bought me disappointment frustration trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem frankly the gps is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes you have to stop remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot then it happens all over again a few minutes later the product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity you wind up thinking how great it was when you had 20 radios that worked i spoke with three garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected every seven minutes come on windows 95 was more stable than that finally i got a guy on the phone who said oh yeah there s a problem with the 530 s you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can if not we can send you some more but i can t make any promises he explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the lcd and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution reading the other reviews i d guess they ve been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now and through multiple software releases i am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair i ve certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases \( linksys routers for instance palm treo s \) but this is no 50 router \( or generally stable 400 phone \) and frankly i have to reset my router once every four months at most this product is really bad i wish it were better because the concept is great but i would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache,negative

in my opinion i own a ton of panasonic equipment most recently a dvd recorder i was using sony dvd rs with no problems but being a panasonic person i figured panasonic must be better in order to save a few bucks i joined the panasonic club at the panasonic website and ordered a spindle of these same type dvd rs i did this on 9 20 06 i made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were and believe it or not nobody at panasonic could tell me why they hadn t been shipped then i was promised that they did ship but i never got them after being talked into placing a duplicate order by a panasonic rep i didn t get that order either i finally received one order on 10 16 06 they were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken now i finally had my discs guess what they were only 1 8x speed \( the sony discs were 1 16x speed \) and my thermal label printer wouldn t print on them because of the finish i had been assured that i could print on them with a thermal printer i did burn a couple of movies and they worked but i saw nothing special that i can report it gets worse i logged into my panasonic club account and saw two charges i hadn t made one for 10 017 and one for 915 i fell off the back of my chair to this day nobody has called me but i managed to get some email responses and i was told i would have to watch my credit card that s just what i need you know sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a company it is and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were i m going back to sony and let me tell you amazon customer service blows away just about every company i ve dealt with \( sorry about the preposition \) i should have bought on amazon,negative

i received this product from an amazon com seller for 1 2 the price of what best buy was selling it for it was new and in an unopened box upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere i had spent over 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd \( directv does not have local hd in my area \) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 reception with it this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94 98 reception depending on the channel \( directional antenna so reception varies slightly \) i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio but i also get locals with over 60 reception from cleveland \( direction antenna is facing \) but also pittsburgh \( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing \) great product and no issues with it so far the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector \( if it has a built in hd tuner \) or tv for best results,positive

i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it 1 5 feet onto a hardwood floor the unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price i wasn t at all surprised when it stopped working the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap the touchscreen is very tedious to customize \( i write software for a living and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen \) i can t imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen unless you are very comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit aside from the touchscreen s fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote did i mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months in short this product is crap i might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less,negative

for this price these are a steal purchased mine for 15 \( with shipping \) and let me tell you it was worth it the headphones come with a 1 4 converter too so you can use them for cd players and amps the sound quality is good and the headphones don t hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours these are an amazing deal for the price i m honestly surprised these arn t marked for 50 don t pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones,positive
easiest remote to program has tremendous ability to tweek will keep recommending to all my customers,positive
i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i ve found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i m amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa s ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa s lasted only a week be warned that these aren t quite the bargain they may initially seem,negative
this isn t a consistent product 99 of the time i can t get it to work after months of emails and phone calls customer service responded what a joke they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in gimme a break i shouldn t have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work by the way their process didn t work poor product poor customer service poor price,negative
we got this phone about 3 years ago in the past month the buttons have begun to be an issue you can press and press a button and maybe on the 3rd try it works finally go another phone as with all things today it isn t made to last however the price makes it less painful to have to buy another so soon,positive
i have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their black and white desktop printer so far not one problem the toner is long lasting and affordable great quality small desktop footprint does a great job with envelopes labels and even light cardstock i would highly reccommend to anyone,positive
i reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as i haven t authored or copied very many dvds with it yet however what i have accomplished with it is commendable i can copy an entire commercial dvd \( movie all the extras \) under 50 minutes i have composed a slide show dvd with my own mp3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it so far no coasters i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old 8mm home movies the converter is giving me more problems than anything still recommend the px 755uf for anyone interested in an external burner installation was a snap \( plug n play \),positive
not a bad product but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well no matter where the antenna is positione,positive
when you buy a name like sony you expect to get decent stuff this dvd recorder failed miserably no s video inputs in the rear so you have to run s video to the front panel \( which my 2 year old loved to unplug \) nice editing features if you have the time unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done \( who knows if i will get it back \) i replaced it with a lite on dvd recorder \( at less than half the price \) and am very happy with it,negative
maybe beginning ones were a bad batch had mine months now and it works great everything it says it does no problems keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors,positive
this product has the potential to be tremendous but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches also there is a big rhigo skin logo on the front which makes the case even that more distracting i m sure that it isn t polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail what a letdown p s if you are buying the 30gb version of this case it will double the thickness of your setup,negative
i got this yoke to use with microsoft flight simulator other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke but what did you expect it s just a computer game controller it s not meant to feel like an actual pilot s yoke if it were it would probably be much much more expensive yes the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick but i ve had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems with it also i rarely need to reconfigure it so there s not an issue of wandering from the centre point all in all this yoke is fairly good and works well with flight simulator it certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you re a real pilot but don t expect to feel any g forces or anything else like that,positive
you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same this is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there 1 the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about they are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them these are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way 2 the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front not even standard phono inputs at the back 3 its advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers and in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts \( log relationship \) for some reason this is not even half as loud as my 100 w receiver 4 no user adjustable equalizer only presets possible 5 cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections 6 the receiver sucks even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver i concur with the other reviewer death to sony shame on them for taking consumers for a ride this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it competively with the others meaning fat profit margins,negative
i m not a system analyst so i need really clear instructions for any new device i bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which i could view from the internet at my office troubles i encountered 1 \) set up was impossible i finally figured out that i had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free internet connection i wasn t willing to do this 2 \) i could view from the internet within my home network but not from my office 3 \) had to convince one of my company s it system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera s system took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure which worked until i had to reset my router 2 weeks of use in one year 4 \) i have never been able to have the camera send snap shots to my e mail or ftp folder d link tech support confirmed that i was setting it up correctly but the feature doesn t work i was told by d link tech support that i may need to disable my internet security program no can do 5 \) d link tech support may not have access to this product they are not able to respond to my inquiries they would send me answers but not to the questions i asked 6 \) the weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time i have tried to purchase so i have not been able to install on the outside of my home it therefore must be used inside which is not what i need i could have paid 80 for an indoor camera every so often when i have a few hours to burn i drag it out and try to make the thing work for the couple weeks it was viewable on the internet it provided a nice view of my home but it wasn t useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation,negative
i did my research before purchasing this wireless card from amazon to use in conjunction with my belkin pre n wireless router according to every net review i d read this combination of belkin pre n desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card router in its class and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router range is what i needed above all after some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself i now regularly have connection qualities in the 77 90 range a good 200 300 ft from my router which is in another building entirely \( and both have a lot of metal cladding and what not i had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability \) the odd thing about this pre n combination from belkin is that apparently the later belkin n equipment is grossly inferior and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model these cards and the pre n router are becoming harder to find as they ve been superseded by the newer \( inferior \) models currently in the stores so if you have to operate wireless at great distances i doubt you ll beat these belkin models for at least the immediate future,positive
i almost didn t purchase this cd player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting but i decided to go for it i am glad i did i am very happy with this sony walkman i use it for walking listening to meditating cds audio books everything and have not had one single problem with it i am so glad i did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision as mentioned in another review i love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again it also fits in my back pocket so i can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores the earpieces fit well there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2 3 weeks must not take care of your things i love it the price was great so don t let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase,positive

the best sound i ve ever heard in a radio i also own a cambridge soundworks 730 and a bose wave cd radio despite the fact that this is a mono radio its sound is incredible accurate warm and powerful the bass is astounding and the highs crystal clear i agree with a report i ve read in cnet that states this is probably the best sounding radio ever made,positive
the uno s midi input did not work with my roland a 37 midi controller keyboard even after downloading the latest drivers using cakewalk \( home studio 4 running on a compaq v2000 laptop \) to record and view the individual midi events i could see that some of the note off messages had been improperly decoded by the uno as note c zero this caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra low note to sound very unpleasant and obviously unusable the midi output did work fine driving my roland fantom xr and roland jv 1010 with no problems after reading another uno a 37 user s identical problem \( on amazon \) i returned the uno and purchased an edirol \( roland \) ua 25 audio midi interface it works perfectly with all of my equipment including the a 37,negative
to my eyes the printer s rendition of colors is above average it isn t horrible but neither is it the best pricewise it s an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature we ve been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via tray 2 \( the default paper supply \) and haven t any problems the manual \( electronic file \) advises never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels so it s a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label a wonderful quality of experience is the near instant on \( very minimal warmup \) feature and it s quiet my previous okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing its time delay was also a disadvantage i think most people will be very happy with the hp,positive
this printer sucks it started out working wonderfully then all of a sudden \( after the third month in use \) it started printing very slowly then it decided it wouldn t print at all unless i completely shut down my computer everytime something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge it also uses the color ink when it s not requested i only needed the color ink a couple of times \( not for pictures \) and it went just as fast as the black i used to love hp they are now making garbage i m thinking of looking at the oki brand don t waste your money on this one,negative
i have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to windows vista as a result of the windows upgrade this product just lost half its value for me the drive works fine physically but the included backup software will not work with vista when i try to schedule an overnight backup the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling as others have noticed here western digital offers zero support for its software i cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem,negative
i m usually a big linksys supporter this is an exception this device is a joke not a very funny one the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely wouldn t work with my printer \( canon mp950 \) i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support don t waste your time,negative
great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that clear easy to read display and instructions menus and interface are self intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it no downloads activations or learning required satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast accuracy is impressive with spot on instructions and updated maps even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand all manufacturers seem to sell them as options \( garmin included \),positive
the tapes are exactly what i had searched the web for thanks to amaxon com for listing the seler,positive
i bought this for my new sony ericson w300i phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone it came with a ms pro adapter which is nice because i have a slot on my computer for that it is fast and just what i wanted,positive

actually i loved the philips acoustic edge an earlier and internal sound card but it did not like my older dual processor system because of that i was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper threading which windows treats as dual processors i bought the aurelium instead i love this thing i am a bit of an audiophile and this sound card is just perfect with my klipsch computer speakers it makes a perfect combination,positive
this unit replaced my old aio 7410 which i loved this one just feels cheap the construction is cheap parts are loose and it feels like a child s toy not an office tool given the choice i would not buy another one,negative
this is a surprisingly good radio at this price it is small compact and yet very robust and quite heavy it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store here are three things i really liked about this product 1 \) the am fm reception is outstanding i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure 2 \) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function this is something sangean seems to get very well 3 \) the multi level display lighting can be turned off or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright a few things i didn t like the pilot light for on is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night i had to put black electrical tape over it the aux input is a mini jack instead of rca connector minor inconvenience here and finally the cabinet is nice wood but the finish is not as good as i think it could be this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price it s a keeper,positive
i m a fanatic for duplexing since i move a lot of paper around sometimes amounts which i have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds the brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well maybe even the best this particular machine has wireless g built in but it costs over 100 more than the same machine without wireless and for well over 100 you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper maybe even better and for my office wireless is inappropriate \( it also should be stated that if you go outside briother itself then the wireless combo is cost effective brother essentially competes here only with itself \) that said it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone s printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router there are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you it s a complete standalone fax copier if someone in the house doesn t even have any computer at all i m a long time brother customer and they ve made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone there were a few bugs in earlier machines by brother \( comparable but older machines i ve owned like the 8500 and the 9700 \) such as faulty out of toner warnings and all of these seem to have been worked out this machine is clearly out of beta earlier machines were difficult \( though not impossible \) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual and this machine is far better on that aspect as well you can have faxes arrive two sided which doubles your paper tray effectively and you can scan or fax a two sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting this last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease of use you wouldn t use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two sided page unfortunately the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the brothers is the ink aspect unlike some competitors you have to replace a toner and a drum and at differing intervals i assume they do this to keep the costs low but the costs still aren t particularly low the non wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over 400 and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners i don t understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a gas tank you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper but in most instances the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer the brother is a superbly functioning modern machine at a great price but don t imagine the price ends when you buy it this is true of all printers however and the news with most printers is worse than here,positive
let s be honest this product ain t cheap it s not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working i bought mine at cpenusa com delivery was great only took them a couple of days however my c pen cable was damaged the connector to the c pen was for some reason cut in half without it you can t recharge or connect the c pen to the pc i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours no response i sent three e mails to cpenusa no response i don t care if the product itself is great \( i ll never know now will i \) if you re unable to receive support when you need em you re screwed if you re just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and don t really care if you re on your own go ahead and try it let me know how this thing really is otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after sales support,negative
despite careful aiming this has exactly and i mean exactly the same signal strength as my cheapie 6 airlink 7db omni and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap but save your money if you re expecting 15db performance,negative
i got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it the unit is beautifully designed fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small my only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong i live in a tough area for reception and there s slight static on my favorite stations the fm antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit but the reception is still not totally clear that being said i m glad i got it and when my wife s happy i m happy,positive

the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i don t accept having a wireless access point that hangs \( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang \) this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine,negative

this univeral dvd player comes packed very neatly in an oppo cloth case and is very sleek the finish of the dvd player is excellent however the remote is not up to snuff in this department this player can play pal dvds it upconverts it to ntsc 1080i it s loaded with features that you probably won t see on most dvd players out there the upconversion works well though i m not sure the color handling is the best the audio controls in the setup are awesome people have complained about the disc tray being flimsy cheap but i think it s just fine it s very quick to load and play you may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won t be able to control most of the features the hdmi cable that is included with the player is of good quality probably worth around fifty bucks in the market price to performance features you can t beat this universal dvd player buy one and you ll know,positive
the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette mp3 cd and radio capability so didn t have much of an option but to get this one i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality overall i think its a good buy,positive

i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are user friendly that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons \( sound changing tracks pause etc \) are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and don t fit well i bought a yellow psyc sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is 3 times the product that this one is the sound is near perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i wouldn t write sony off simply b c of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them,negative

for the price i doubt you could do better true there are higer end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance but if all you re after is a significant improvement in the quality of every channel and dvd you watch you can t beat the ads for it s price the biggest flaw is the device s inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my philips plasma set to black out for moments this aside i m very happy with the ads especially it s under 300 price one day maybe i ll upgrade to a unit by dvdo but not until they come don to the sub 500 range,positive
i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me so far it does what it s suppose to do i am pleased it s a little clunky and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended we ll see how it works in 6 months,positive

this is a great product for those who probably don t write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally,positive

well i got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker then the rear right channel didn t work at all after calling tigerdirect to see about a refund the first customer service rep was rude and unwilling to help said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown ups box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts after getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough the headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn t sound that good at all,negative
i bought these for some sony surround sound speakers although i was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is \( essentially \) plastic however they turned out to be very sturdy and easy to install i also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware well worth the price,positive
i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini \( pink \) is a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge \( no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies \) is about 2 hours apple will gladly sell me a new \( 70 \) battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they re selling shoddy products i m not saying don t buy it there aren t realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i m going to dig out my old discman,negative

oem charger failed replaced with this one it s more compact functions well,positive
i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office i had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i d get some good listening along with the good looks my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem i was very disapointed,negative
i also had the model before the m85v and got great reception this new model gets terrible reception i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception don t waste your money on this model,negative
the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case i can t believe the case didn t come this way and that s just the start of the problems the dials are fussy and it s not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case if you haven t cut any slits in it and re tune your station in minneapolis st paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown but that station has howitzer power forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city granted i didn t buy this to listen to fm or shortwave it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that won t happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area that s really difficult to imagine being other radios i own even chintzy giveaway promotional radios can pull in most any station in the metro area if this is an example of grundig s work i d say they rely more on their brand name than their products,negative

got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable don t even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty,positive

pros like a quality piano the keys give a sense of weight the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed the mouse offers great control though i haven t much used all the buttons that are one the form cons the only gotcha is if the computer freezes there is no way to control alt delete also setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts,positive
great joystick i didn t think i could find any better than my sidewinder but i was wrong very configurable and smooth,positive
the only good thing about this product is its price \( i saw it being sold at 160 on some other site \) there are several shortcomings though the greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu there is no home location also there are only two navigation options available shortest time shortest distance so if you are caught in a traffic jam for example there is no detour function also you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa the maps are probably very old i used this device in nj va mn in every state i faced problems multiple times when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead it would not tell me to keep on left right or it would ask me take turns when there were none the unit was very slow in calculating routes \( i dont know how the sirf star iii chip helps \) also it would freeze often i would need to reset it at critical junctions the viamichellin website is only dedicated to europe when i went to register my product i had to register it in viamichellin uk since there was no option for us i dont think they have any support for the us models the pois are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range i returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months it was great on part of amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy \( although they deducted 20 restocking fee \),negative

switch was simple to install to my existing network just plug and go i used this switch to separate some cpus off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway worked just as planned and was seamless i actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch network speed and response time increased even for those cpus w out a gig nic i like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic highly recommend,positive
i ve found the befsx41 \( v2 0 \) to be very problematic with firmware version 1 50 18 some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes bringing down the entire net with the newer firmware version 1 52 10 it fixes this problem but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server \( passthru tcp port 80 \) making the router totally unusable tech support was friendly and helpful and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1 50 18 for our websites and upgrade each time to 1 52 10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking so now we upgrade downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week and each time we do it brings down our net i ve also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands you cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips also it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number even though they map to two different computers this makes it impossible for example to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time,negative
these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity \( 12x \) at 1 4 the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology,negative

the overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic the sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion the pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn t have a very good range \( very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results \) not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of otherwise i would not have purchased the item,negative
for the price these speakers are well worth the cost of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice only bad thing i ll say is that m audio s tech department is really bad emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer \( my inquiry was about a different m audio product \),positive
for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children it s going back,negative

i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and wouldn t do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it doesn t help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem,negative

do not buy this system for the money there are much better systems out there i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers the main problem with the system \( which bose has corrected by the way \) is that the acoustimass component \( bose s fancy name for a subwoofer \) is not active \( or powered \) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges the result is that you get a very tinny sound out of most applications including dvd s i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely and the size of the cubes is nice still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system but hey got sucked into the bose marketing machine,negative
this is a great idea a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line unfortunately the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line all in all tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems one wouldn t play the disc one wouldn t eject the disc one had an led readout that would go blank and one had variations on all of these problems the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind but the model cd needs a lot more work,negative
i like many other people that have written reviews here researched the purchase of an mp3 player in great detail other members of my family own ipods and that is the direction that i was heading until i did a massive amount of research if you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on cd this is the unit that you want ipod will not let you download your own songs i did not know that until after i purchased this player \( thankfully \) this unit was the highest rated unit by far that i was able to scour the internet for if this is your first purchase of an mp3 player \( like mine \) buy this one no questions asked do not worry about trying to buy 80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal crisp clear awsome base and i have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40 i cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing i received this player in the mail today at 5 30 when i got home from work and by 6 35 i have transfered the 114 artists folders \( about 4 000 songs \) that i had ripped on my computer last week \( about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player \) i would recomend buying the cradle it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo which i plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool absolutley buy this unit i have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and i have a high performance expectation and it has met it,positive
what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play i took it to the apple store in mall of america \( minneapolis mn \) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it i go back home \( ok \) and it still does not work apple said for 113 they ll fix gee thanks i ll be looking at another brand apple stinks,negative

horrible the gears ingage before the tape is even loaded you have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it s own when the tapes are rewinding it is very loud and slams the tape when it is done you can just hear the damage being done this model destroyed several of my daughters tapes we really needed a rewinder to preserve our vcr and chose this model because it has an option to clean the tapes preserving them also this would be great providing it functioned properly thinking maybe i got a defunct one i had amazon send out another it too functioned in the exact same manner nope mine wasn t bad their all bad this model is disfunctional i ve advised amazon not to carry units that they have become aware do not work properly i wish amazon direct had good models to choose from this one is not,negative
i m so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i don t have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them very cool,positive

i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about it must be your computer did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead s movie factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz \( their program \) duh guess what it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads s product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product p s since ads doesn t consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i don t think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is it was packed well ju,negative
i ve owned two of these now the screen s great and i love the wireless headphones terrific for very small children our 2 year old drove to new mexico and back \( well we drove and he watched videos \) with this thing unfortunately both units broke after less than a year of use the first one just stopped working \( with a dvd permanently trapped inside \) the second one just developed an intermittent white out and screen noise that s happening once a minute now so i am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one all of these little players seem to have reliability problems so my main advice to everybody is buy the extended warranty and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles you will be cashing it in,negative
i haven t had any problems using this dvd cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger in fact setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual it was truly plug and play minor quibbles the open close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case and only the lite version of toast 6 is included bottom line i would buy this burner again given my experiences using it,positive
its a good accessory for archos product i have 604 wifi its compatible with generation 4 archos devices pros 1 \) good build 2 \) enough connections to expand cons 1 \) it very much costly as compare to it utility 2 \) it comes with charger which should be a part of standard item 3 \) there could be more cables included in this package like spdif usb mini cable 4 \) in this cost it could have a backup battery \( extra \) that could be part of \( built in \) the docking station so that archos device can have longer play time i think archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can if it is then it would not go a long,negative
the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless on battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost invest in batteries rather than this product,negative
just received radio yesterday and am returning radio today pluses adequate lcd display and good illumination while on ac adapter good thumbwheel tuning in 1 khz increments adequate speaker fidelity for small radio however the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 5 6 there is a big noticeable increase in volume \( not good \) and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker also on fm if hands are near the radio the signal breaks up \( for weaker signals not strong ones \) and compared to my grundig 400 pe which i feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome the eton e 5 seems worse still i am returning this today and obtaining the sony 7600gr instead eton e 5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my sony 2010,negative

there are brands i trust and ones i don t sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck,negative
i wanted a simple printer so i could print a few prints from time to time to hand out on sale for 50 this seemed like the right one i already had the included zoombrowser and photo stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a canon a95 camera so i just needed to install the driver note this requires a usb cable \( not included \) to the printer as is human nature i tried to print without reading the zoombrowser instructions and got a lovely plain sky blue print with the words my album on it but no photo \) then out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines this was from a residual click from my first attempt ok ok so i looked at the pdf printing guide for about 15 seconds and followed the instructions got a beautiful first print of the queen mary ship got a gorgeous second print of flags \( red white blue and green \) againt a clear blue sky and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near mt lassen \( ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints \) so i ve blown through the provided trial 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge and have 3 very nice prints \( with postcard address lines stamp area and canon logo on the back the paper comes that way \) the ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1 2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing i can t compare the printing software to any other brand but setting up a plain photo only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices if you want to add backgounds titles text etc that is available as well \( got another pack of paper film and put humorous captions on kind of funny bad office christmas pix \) printing directly from my a95 takes about the same time as from the computer about 1 min 45 sec the actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times \( 3 color passes and a protective layer \) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot the finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front the unit looks and feels substantial for its small size comes well packed \( survived ny to ca shipping \) has decent documentation and a 1 year warranty,positive
i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last after a year or so they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems any scratches that they have only make it worse i recommend using sony fuji or tdk all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don t stand the test of time so if you care about preserving your cds don t use these ones,negative

i bought this premium priced product because it has both built in voice mail and speakerphone the latter was the key feature i sought well it works intermittently just enough so you can tell \( occasionally \) that it s on but infrequently enough that you can t actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation it reminds me of the can you hear me now commercials i d rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well ugh do not buy this product,negative
okay this is not a review of the product itself but i strongly encourage you to consider not getting an n e w warranty they are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things if you had anything to do with the device not working \( e g you dropped it forget about it they aint gonna fix replace it whatever \) they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia \( of course you have to pay for the shipping \) lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n e w warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n e w will take months to pay them for the work they did if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it,negative
this is my second set of garmin radios i have had the 120 s for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530 s first of all i really like the new color screen and the added features the altimeter has been upgraded over the 120 s and seems to be more accurate my old 120 s sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes i would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models we do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top the new compass is also helpful with the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right after calibrating the new compass \( turning in a circle \) it will work just like a regular compass i still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down you can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go the 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can t see your next way point as with all the rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side i really think it s because of the waterproofing that they do if you don t put it close to your mouth when speaking it s really not that bad i did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications lock up problem i have experienced this once or twice the first time i used them i did the garmin update and have not had the problem since overall these new 530 s are great i have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week now that i have 4 of these \( 2 120 s and 2 530 s \) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group looking forward to the ski slopes this winter we always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours if you do a lot of outdoor activities or any geocaching with more than one person these are perfect,positive
if you re an anti commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over if however you don t like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard am fm you might like this tuner many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting hd signals the quality of hd is most amazing on quiet passages in classical music there is no noise at all very quiet you do notice the hdt 1 is quite sensitive it will pull in stations that other tuners won t and i m not even talking about the hd2 streams that the stations are starting to feature clear channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with hd their stations sound good and most of the fm s are doing hd2 a few have some interesting formats not heard on most am fm stations i hope the get even more adventurous my only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get hd to lock in on am or fm i don t believe that to be a fault of the tuner it s the hd system and just like fm did i m sure it will improve \( ask someone over 50 about fm drift \) i give it 5 stars it s not perfect but for the price it s very good and for a first generation product i don t think it could be better than this,positive

i just recently bought a sub woofer and i spent a good deal of time searching for an interconnect the interconnects i looked at ranged from ridiculously over priced to questionably cheap i knew i wanted it to be thx certified and of a length that would allow me some freedom of sub woofer placement this interconnect provided both at a very reasonable price i must say after installing my subwoofer that this cable was a perfect choice some might say that the cost reflects a cables ability to provide good sound wrong this is just as good as those 70 dollar interconnects i do buy monster cable for most of my home theatre needs but i do not buy into some of the hype surrounding monster cable and their more expensive cables why only 4 and not 5 stars i did not like the way the cable was packaged the cable was folded down the middle and now the center of the cable has a crook in it i would have perfered it to be wound around a plastic spool to avoid folding of the cable getting past that its a good interconnect that produces great sound,positive
the cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the airport express this comes with a 2 meter rca ministereo a 2 meter optical ministereo and a 6ft power cable i found that both the rca and optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver i wish that the power cable was a little longer and i would ve liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set the installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some,positive

i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2 0 gb compact flash card i like it but the flash card doesn t slide in easily sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they don t i d much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process not a quality reader other than that it works as expected surprisingly the reader doesn t topple over as easily as i thought it would it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in removing the card is extremely easy that s a one handed process eject the card from the pc s drive and then remove it data transfer from the card to pc is very quick overall i m glad to have it but it s an annoyance to use it i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader,negative
the dvds are a rip off although i m counting on the rebate to at least break even \( not counting my time \) the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk \( i d recommend verbatim s dvd r dl product made in singapore \) as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i haven t submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments,negative

we bought this to use with our ws 300m to record a class we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording in the end we set the recorder to mono \( hq \) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other good quality but distracting save your money and buy the mono mic the quality is excellent in either setting buy the way in case you miss it this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder,positive

i have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is not true i purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids she and i both have newer nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all with hers we can make a connection and following drections carefully we can get it to energize the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality the printer will not pull the paper though properly \( we have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son in law look at it \) i read reviews by others but feel this printer is simply not reliable i wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase in my opinion canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras i m in the process of trying to return it to amazon we re going to buy an hp which i should have done initially thank you,negative

i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5 the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag unfotunately it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies when worn as a waist bag it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag there are two water pouches on the slinger bag \( which is a real requirement as i live in arizona \) the adorama slinger bag is a great travel bag it is light weight and has great utility i highly recommend it,positive
can t say enough good things about this brother all in one given its price and features \( i paid 100 more than the new amazon price elsewhere a week ago \) i installed as a network device and set up the software on my xp pro as well as mac os 10 4 9 machines easy installation and the interface on each os is essentially the same super fast prints from either machine crisp and beautiful with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous hp laser duplex scan fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase and i ve been really happy what i did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior hp experience noises don t seem unusual to me no crackling here just noisy paper handling by adf and print engine no big deal imho only a few minor negatives i ve seen so far \( 1 \) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a windows computer so mac folks are stuck there \( mine was delivered with current version of firmware so maybe this doesn t matter \) \( 2 \) you cannot feed heavy stock through it even the manual feed tray so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24 stock \( 3 \) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device and \( 4 \) expansion memory is not a popular size so is more expensive than current pc memory not sure if i ll upgrade or not haven t tried envelopes yet so can t respond to earlier comments from others it s kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy as pages in the adf suck in and out to scan both sides and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side,positive

this was terrible i returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with apple support desk the product will probably be better with future software updates but in my experience it was fairly unreliable in its current state examples of problems wouldn t download drm managed content online had problems when downloading itunes purchased music \( the first time i ve had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes \) couldn t connect to my corporate vpn and finally just as evidence of the lack of qa on this device the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the apple extreme the images were of the previous white button shaped device this was a genuine disappointment and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad qa others seem to have had more success but i m back on my 802 11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared,negative
i used to buy those cheap red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets just to have some fun but the batteries didn t last long enough and the beam wasn t bright at all not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round i bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green i thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot but it is much more than i thought it would be the beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day the range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers i love it a much better buy than those crappy red ones and the aaa batteries are easy to replace and last much longer,positive

the material and ergonomics of this phone is average the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience range the range of the phone is very good i can be 80 100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop call quality average i have a plantronics cs50 wireless headset that is on the 900 mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear when i have switched during mid conversation from the handset to headset or vice versa callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call the uniden is much more muffled and less clear it is however comparable to most cordless phone not exceptional but not bad durability average i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn t scratch the hardwood floor special note i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm the base unit will not boot up this appears to have happened to other reviewers this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house on this issue i have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars,negative
i bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn t be happier the phones have the clarity of a corded phone the built in intercom system is perfect the phones allow you to name the handsets as we did \( kitchen basement bedroom etc \) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers they have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in as well as jacks for headset \( though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary one problem with these phones is the batteries in the year that we have had them the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours and we would go through all four phones leave a phone off the charger and in a day it s useless the only solution was to replace the batteries \( which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re programming all the phone numbers \) i recommend the energizer er p240 which is a nickel metal hydride battery and won t develop the ni cad memory effect i love that the base station has a place for 4 aaa batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage,positive
warning this unit has flaws that can render it useless my intention was to share my dvi monitor with my usb keyboard and mouse between my pc and mac simple enough this unit fit the bill according to the specs however as soon as i hooked everything up per the directions the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop i had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about alright 20 minutes googling for support lead me to the conclusion that i needed to perform firmware upgrade warning don t do it attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from xp will most certainly render it a paperweight there is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails and it will under xp when i tried the update i the utility reported tramsit error note the spelling on the word transmit that is how belkin spells it in the utility if they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader what chance is there the code is quality anyway that was the kiss of death the unit was dead and had to be sent back for rma unacceptable i would not recommend this product to anyone it is the worst kvm ever,negative

this is a great card for a laptop however they need to correct their problems with the installer for xp also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line once you do get to them they fix the problem right away seems they know it will not install correctly then it works great,positive
they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably won t cut the cheese,positive
these batteries last a long time cheaper batteries won t hold a charge after repeated use charging i have aa energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems,positive
there are some things i like about this others i don t some people have written similar reviews but i want to add my 2 cents hope this helps potential buyers likes 1 small easy to use 2 good sound quality 3 good storage capacity for those of us who don t have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers 4 some people have complained that the creative media software is hard to understand i disagree i found it straightforward you can even change the titles artists and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player yes i realize this can also be done in wmp but sometimes you want to edit later or you missed something earlier 5 replaceable battery if it dies you can get another one you don t have to send it in to the company dislikes 1 the shuffle mode is annoying it doesn t go through the entire playlist on shuffle once a song is over it goes right back onto the potential playlist and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played to the exclusion of the other items on the list i want to hear all my songs at least once before i hear repeats 2 the creative media center software doesn t install on windows vista 3 this is a hard drive player so no running with it that s okay though for people like me i don t run it also makes it cheaper than the ipod nano which is a flash player 4 the cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer i don t like this because i m not always around my computer i don t lug it with me everywhere i go however there are ports you can buy \( here on amazon even \) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports so that s handy 5 not as many accessories as the ipod but not that important 6 you can t view your photos while you are listening to music sometimes this sucks but if you have a camera phone or are in an actual conversation with someone you probably won t be listening to your music anyway,positive
i would encourage anyone in the market for a shredder to first identify where the machine is to be placed if you want something cute and compact then keep looking this sb 97cs is a work horse in every sense of the word consequently it may not appeal to one s feminine traits although the size can be a bit formidable for home use it s power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others i was surprised at just how quiet it was the controls are easy to master and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child having had a lessor \( un named \) shredder i knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste paper basket sized machines for less money being one who regularly shreds credit card bait checks and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years this sb 97cs shredder was a must have i doubt that i ll outgrow this machine i ve had this shredder for only a couple of months now and i expect to have it for many years to come it is necessary to oil the cutters after each full basket though if you are the disciplined and conscientious type this is not a problem however i can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don t read instructions,positive

i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i couldn t listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn,negative
the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words 1 you cannot talk on both phones at the same time \( instead you can transfer a call to the other phone \) 2 the range is not great \( though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft \) 3 the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it s a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household,negative

i had the tx sr304 everything sounded great however certain times when i played my dvd the onyko produced a loud high pitched ear piercing sound sounds almost like a record scratching the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu when it replays the music theme the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again then making that loud sound everything was great but this one problem made me return this item which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise,negative

i had owned an lg burner and from the time i got it it never worked right i must have made 60 or 70 coasters before i decided that it was nt the media it was the crappy lg brand burner i was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good but as i found out with my lg experience that is not always true my brother has an older model sony burner and although his is slow it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it so i took a chance and purchased the sony dru 810a that was the best decision i could have made i will never buy another brand burner other that sony brand i have had this burner about 7 or 8 months i am a very heavy burner and i have not made one coaster one thing i loved about my brother s sony burner is that i could use any brand of media the same thing is true of the dru 810a i don t have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is this burner loves everything i had looked at the plextor brand but i did nt want to pay 100 00 and i looked at nec brand liteon benq etc but i am so happy that i passed on them all and got the sony it burns super fast some people say that it is loud but it s not loud to me i got my burner from tiger direct for 50 00 my sister s computer came with a crappy lg brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too so for christmas i am buying her a sony dur 810a so she can finally burn some movies for my money this is the best burner bar none,positive

buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again used to have one years ago now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer,positive
i purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my bose main speakers for my surround sound set up at that time i felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as i listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups i came to realize that the bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par so last year i purchased a polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane the polk speaker which costs the same as the bose \( 199 \) was far and away the better product the sound is cleaner crisper sharper it made watching movies much more enjoyable i couldn t believe what i had been missing out on all these years the only reason i purchased the bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound i have now with polk center and bose main is excellent depending on who you ask the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system if that s true then i wouldn t recommend bose because all you re doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that s a waste of money i know because i made that mistake,negative

good thing first efficient on battery convenient and compact doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge thats it as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony utterly non user friendly i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy i had 1gb of atrac songs on this player from my computer then one day my computer hdd crashed i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me \( a very indifferent group of people \) it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt that it is absolutely infuriating,negative
i gave my mother in law my old color sportrack so she could start geocaching i was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen this unit is it although it is large it has features i like aa batteries \( 19 hours we ll see \) easy menu navigation usb connection to a pc and a rugged case i am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces etc i have sent in a list of problems i have found with the menu navigation all of them can be worked around but it doesn t work the way i think they intended it will be interesting to see if magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of fw \( i am using 1 05 \) after doing a lot of research about megllan sw \( mostly negative \) i decided to go ahead and purchase the mapsend directroute v 3 dvd i found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it one nit the files it creates are very small you need to edit a text file in the magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files but once you get the maps downloaded to your unit \( very straight forward \) the menus change to indicate turning direction thus it is getting closer to a crossover unit interestingly magellan will offer a new unit called the crossover \( available january 2007 \) the specs are pretty sparse on the magellan web page,positive

i have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on op tech came up with the solution all you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go super easy to take off putting on takes a little more time but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt water etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots it is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used,positive
this pny 2 0gb card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card we purchased the 2 gig card for my wife s canon powershot s 900 elph to replace smaller memory cards although 1gb cards worked adequately with the elph we noticed early on that its 10 0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card the 2 0gb holds many more photos \( over 400 shots and counting \) than the 1gb at half the price of other brands the pny is proving to be very satisfactory \( we purchased two 2 0s at once \) we happily recommend the pny 2 0gb photo card for your photos it makes a great gift candidate get yours soon,positive

things that i like \( 1 \) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it but really do like it also this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles \( 2 \) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard even if you don t have windows vista you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs \( 3 \) the keyboard has no lag for me whatsoever \( 4 \) i m a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys etc \( 5 \) this is a small change but i m using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop the software replaced the large volume notifications \( onscreen display showing volume level mute etc \) with a smaller more attractive style notification me gusta \( 6 \) the curved keyboard is also comfortable it requires no time nor effort getting used to it \( 7 \) i haven t had any problems with the keyboard being out of range \( 8 \) for the mouse i m switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3 0 which is also made by microsoft to the laser 6000 mouse included this new mouse is more comfortable \( not a huge difference but noticeable \) it is also lighter and slides around with little effort what i don t like \( 1 \) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click start then log off windows i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down hibernate dialog instead i haven t found that option available so far \( 2 \) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others but i don t find it to be a problem it s just different having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width five stars,positive

i m very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i m very happy,positive

this is a great product it was easy to mount and looks great the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees this hasn t caused any problems and i m sure this is well within its design strength highly reccommended,positive
i ve been very pleased with this external drive 500gb my only comments would be that at first the drive was a little hit or miss with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it now it seems to always mount its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive the other thing would be that it could use one more firewire 400 port \( there is only one \) i don t use 800 yet so i need to daisy it off of my smartdisk firelite that happens to have 2 all in all get this drive,positive
this is a great card reader for the price why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have personally i only use compactflash and sd cards it reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably the shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards which you ll want to do a bit carefully it would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the sandisk logo on the card reader it is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first but once you get the feel of it it beccomes quite easy and routine this sandisk has led indicators that are helpful one amber led to tell you the unit is connected to your usb and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert \( solid green \) or that it s reading or writing \( blinking green \) this card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and i feel it represents a good value i would recommend it,positive
we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback i m not sure what everyones problem is it s not a radio tower it s a transmitter the size of your finger i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block,positive
i have been a subscriber for 4 years back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving 3 calls a day for payment i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment payment was made calls stopped for another week the radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm they offered me 3 months of free service to come back anyone who cancels can get this by the way and i refused the 3 calls a day continued for the next week i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system 2 more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that 40 dollars i call in and state i never reactivated my radio thus i don t owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of 2 weeks later i get another bill i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything so then last month i start receiving collections notices you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back this apparently has taken care of the issue though i never received the call back this week i called 6 times 3 of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason and was told each time that it had been resolved so hopefully this time it really is to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp3 player,negative

the headphones sound great no arguement there however i was removing the plastic tips \( which need to be changed every several months \) and the headphones broke the company has only a one year warranty so i was out of luck again i thought the sound was great but for this price i would expect them to be more durable i was hardly touching them when they broke off also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times,negative

this switch works really well i use it between a windows xp and windows 98 operating systems when switching to windows 98 control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly however when switching to the xp os control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds i also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one usb port on the pc it frees up a port using the numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch it also has buttons on the device itself to select which pc to control i rate this product 5 stars when i posted the first time i thought i put 5 stars but i must have accidentally selected 2 i recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price,negative
after going through nearly 6 mouses \( including several of the microsoft mouses \) i settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back it also works with my kvm switch which is a key consideration the buttons are a bit stiff but i expect them to loosen up a bit after some use i highly recommend this mouse,positive

maybe i m bias because i really like yamaha maybe because i have kinda good ears or it s the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub woofer i looked around a long time for the right sub and i like to think i got a good one here you want power ok it s only 250 watts not 1 000 watts like velodyne but in my room \( 30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling \) it rocks i love music all kinds loud or quiet no matter i like both but i do like depth more than volume however i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it and let me say you can feel music if you want to one of the things i love most about this sub is it s range it can \( maybe \) reach 20 hertz 20 hertz that is astounding 20hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear in fact it s starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard maybe i have good ears and maybe i don t but to hear rich airy low end and bass notes yes bass notes bass is not one big boomy lump of noise it s huge open grazing pasture of distinct sounds in short music sounds great even hip hop \( which i don t like \) sounds well better also their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement at very quiet levels too you can hear good clean bass notes but if you do a lot of quite listening we re talking back ground music levels disable the auto on feature and manually turn it on and off because if you happen to be listening to something quiet even if you still can here low notes from this it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto on well on it improves movies as well take something with a lot of dynamics like the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy or sky captain and the world of tomorrow there are a lot of sudden loud and very low sounds in those movie s and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb with most of the controls are on the front set up is and tweaking is made easy and if you are wondering about the bass button if the button is in the music position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the movie position \( i think music is a flatter frequency response \) as this review seems to be getting a bit long i ll some it up yes there are far better subwoofers out there \( like from b w \) but i don t have the money for those and if someone gave me a 1 000 watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat but i wouldn t want to give this one up too it s a absolute pleasure to listen to update i have run some test tones on this subwoofer and well it can not reach 20hz 38hz seems to be the limit for usable bass although it is still audible to around 32hz 20hz is a stretch if 38hz sounds to high their are not many movie s or cd s that have any sounds below 35hz and very very few have sound below 25hz although it does not go as low as i would have hoped it is still a good sub for the money and still worth a five star review,positive

the author tries to bring both the biography of walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither it is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time but after reading the title and reviews i was hoping for a detailed biography of walsingham or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers instead it is a general overview of walsingham s life with references to the work that he did there are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of elizabeth i if you want details and a better understanding of walsingham the man and his life work and actions you will need to look elsewhere,negative
the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition s cover however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen with just twenty pages my seven year old breezed through the book in six minutes the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria i ve made some cookies for tea said ma the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma s by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail the final arrival for this story is grandma with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child s grandma s cookies there are roughly two to four sentences on each page the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this,negative

i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion while it was unique it was too hard to get into i also really hated the story it was also too confusing to follow to strange to enjoy and to boring to care i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club the reivews by the way in the club were 50 50 some loved it the rest of us hated it there was no in between i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors i m not sure who else would like it,negative
i m in love with the impressionists in general and with auguste renoir in particular his palette is full of light soft pink greens and blues are a joy to watch time and again as most impressionists renoir paint wonderful every day scenes mainly outside as his magnificent the luncheon of the boating party \( 1881 \) the swing \( 1876 \) and le moulin de la galette \( 1876 \) whose careful reproductions are shown here he was an artist that loved life and wanted to reflect it as he perceived full of little moments of simple joy and relax he was also a masterful portrayer as you may see from his on the terrace \( 1881 \) in the cover of this book or two girls in black \( 1881 \) another subject that attracted his fancy was the dancing couple which he depicts with tenderness and accuracy it doesn t matter if the dancers are from the high class as in city dance or commoners as in dance at bougival both from 1883 at the end of his life his paintings evolve and produce for our delight seated bather \( 1914 \) and the nymphs \( 1918 \) his life and works are described and commented by the author with keen penetration and endearment reproductions are awesome and do justice to the artist do not miss this book reviewed by max yofre,positive

the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again i was disappointed soon after when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle and then even that was disappointing i mean graceland for a first date i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights and logan and nate from that same book none of them can talk in complete sentences and stella who comes across as this loving mother who puts her kids before anything else works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn t there to oversee everything even though the place has been successful for years there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband she just does it unless of course it was in the last 50 pages which i didn t bother to read because i just couldn t torture myself any longer and i m a big fan of roberts i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be i m certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out,negative

i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail it just doesn t click for me i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self,negative
great story excellent in fact my beef is with the narrator and editor as someone who grew up in the baltimore area i thoroughly enjoyed the local references however it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce baltimore icons like boog s bbq at camden yards for the record it is not pronounced bow g it is boo g do better research,positive

tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other get caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society s responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother,positive

if you are looking for a feel good book about baby boomer retirement this book may have some value for you but if you are looking for specific in depth how to this book isn t the answer each segment work dreams travel is short and doesn t address many relevant issues for example regarding the work chapter the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap well that is speculative with globalism those jobs may be outsourced most are low paying many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining yes there may be wal mart jobs but is this your retirement dream the work chapter sounds a lot like most do what you love books but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner,negative
many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 or phil gramm s problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read,negative

almost everyone you meet is having trouble with a relationship this book by charles swindoll is a wonderful tool to assist people to build better relationships from my own person experience i have come to conclude that the larger part of relationship problems are caused by lack of communacation in this book charles talks about how to be open in a relationship and the value of trust not only in a personal relationship but also in the church a wonderful must read,positive
this book is pure fiction nothing more the problem is that is presented as fact albeit little known fact i won t repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book it makes for difficult reading it really is not worth the effort as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end in fact if you are a historian or scholar stay away from it,negative
these are all short stories some very short that s what he wrote i remember reading a number of these \( the science fiction ones mostly \) in translation years ago rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting as a collection of all his fictions some of the items are a bit repetitive the variations on the knife fight theme for instance but the range of his imagination is fascinating particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity a lot of it presages the information based world of today which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind perhaps the link to the internet is one reason borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles is not the web exactly borges book of sand a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information but when we turn to find them again we never can and how long will it be before an imagined orbis tertius engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on \( one might suggest it s already happened look up tatooine for instance \) what exactly is information when it s just a bunch of ones and zeros everything s already been written in the library of babel after all the other fascinating thread to me was the influence of arabic and muslim themes i d never caught that before but this collection includes a number of stories with an arab perspective perhaps this is a well known part of spanish heritage in any case it was certainly interesting getting to know borges through this collection from the knife fights to the arabian courts to the immortals not everything was great but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with,positive

one good knight \( 2006 \) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series following the fairy godmother in the previous volume alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician after the death of the katschei alexander and elena were wedded becoming godmother and consort then an order of champions was established at glass mountain with alexander as their master and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms in this novel princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old but is still considered a child by her mother queen cassiopeia and chief advisor solon adacritus she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor after that her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry and assigns a steward to handle her affairs andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard she reports this matter to her mother afterward andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature as it comes toward her she recognizes that it is a dragon then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon it flames some high architectural features grabs a couple of animals and flies away the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen s advisors is very lively andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons consisting mainly of myths and legends and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens the ensuing discussion is even livelier mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down a lottery is organized some women find ways to disqualify themselves but others are taken by the dragon rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice but then andromeda is selected this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms andromeda s knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon but the good knight doesn t come forward as expected someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors however andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance they travel cross country in the same direction that the dragon had flown stopping for supplies here and there and finally enter the wyrding lands they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems andromeda is nineteen and naive then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues does her mother love her while many events occur in this plot this one issue is the crux of the story even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure betrayal and romance arthur w jordi,positive

yay this book was fun and extremely informative at first the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny \( to keep it humorous for me i conjured up in my mind a tall overgrown middle aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons \) anyway i digress as a doctoral graduate student taking a neuroscience course this book really helped me nail down structures of way too many things but ultimately it helped me make the grade if you get the book make sure to color in it it really does help \( not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day \) otherwise what s the use of buying a book like this it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don t color in it,positive
i did a fast skimming through this book and noticed that for an essential monster movie guide it certainly doesn t praise or hype the genre that well this book comes across like it was written by an elitist who s too good for horror nearly every movie special gets a low rating and i can t understand why a book like this that could ve been a good companion to the horror fan would be so anti horror as a whole horror fans in general want to be be entertained and or scared i for one don t want logical stories and things that make sense if it detracts from the entertainment factor because typically what makes sense and uses logic in horror is boring it gets 2 stars from me because it offers a diverse selection of films and includes mini biographies of horror legends like vincent price christopher lee peter cushing lon chaney boris karloff etc but for a horror movie book the writers certainly didn t help their genre by bad mouthing it so much in this book,negative

this book reveiw is on a book named last summer with maizon this book is about two best friends named margarate and maizon who lives on madison street her friend maizon was accepted to blue hills a school where really educated people go margarate does not want them to be separated every night she wishes maizon will not get accepted but when margarate s father has a second heart attack he dies and now all margarate has is maizon her mother her little brother jay and the people around margarete was having a rough time anyway and then maizon got accepted to blue hills when it was time for maizon to leave margarate her mother and maizon s grandmother dropped her off when maizon wasn t there with margarate her whole life changed at school she was becoming popular she was liked now days passed by and maizon still didn t call when margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house that s when maizon calls margarate was so excited that maizon wanted to come home margarate ran to the grandmother s house telling her the news margarate said maizon wants to come home the grandmother says that she would go get her when maizon got home it was like old times they ran into each others arms they then went to their favorite spot and started talking maizon said she came back because she wasn t being treated right she didn t feel the same so they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend maizon i think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars this book has mostly everything of real life it deals with best friends for example like my friendship with kiena it has separation like my sister and me it has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson i think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life i like this book because it reminds me of my life me and my friends how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking it reminds me of how i lose people in my family and then cry because i miss them if i could buy this book i would let my whole family read it i would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do this book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it it is so good that i really read it because i don t really read books and when i read the book it made me think of when my best friend ariel was going to move and how it made me feel and how i compare it to margarate and maizon this book is excellent the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend if you ask my best friend johnniece she ll say that she really enjoyed the book that it should get five stars because the author really put thought confidence respect love care and her whole heart into this book when i say she put confidence in this book i meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit the author thought about the words thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion i think that this book should be the book of the month in my school because it shows and teaches a lesson with the summary i wrote i put my heart in it because when i read it it touched my heart i won t want my friend away from me i think that i mostly relate to maizon because when she left margarte was beginning to be liked and the girl was talking about maizon and margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend i relate to maizon i relate to her because if people don t like me i don t care if people want me out of somewhere then i ll leave and if people love me i love them back and that s how maizon is she doesn t take junk alot of people relate to maizon this book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on this book is really a good book that shows you friendship break up and everything else that deals with real life i love this book it is really good and i think that if most people had this book then they wouldn t be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing this book really didn t grasp dr kings dream because when maizon went to blue hills the whites were treating her bad they saw her different brenliniqua class 7 512,positive

yes ben witherington is a \( relative \) conservative but don t hold that against him yes he has strong opinions but don t hold that against him either because they are well argued the fact remains that this is the best overview of third quest jesus scholarship i have been able to find admirers of the jesus seminar may not appreciate his critique but it is very fair and well thought out one of the benefits from a book like this besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research is that the different views of jesus can help one achieve a well rounded portrait of the savior no one scholar gets it right all the time \( not even witherington with his own view of jesus as god s wisdom \) but the different insights are valuable because jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend that should be a cause for humility \( something some jesus scholars have lacked at least in print \) i highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary jesus scholarship,positive
other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit picking and general vindictiveness of this book i agree with these criticisms but i m not going to revisit them here the deeper problem lies with the ayn rand institute which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ari s party line as long as the ayn rand institute refuses full unconditional scholarly access to miss rand s papers any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice nor should they be,negative
charles h kahn s account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion although less than 200 pages long is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality in a concise but intelligent summary kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn s treatment \( or lack of \) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought but this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language,positive
this was the only bertrice small book i could find in the gift shop of an airport that should have been warning enough not to buy it rosamund was an unlikeable character she left her 3 young daughters so she could make love constantly and then was oh so superior with her maid when annie did the same i guess being a rich snotty noblewoman means you re not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help i found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived small s readers are smarter than most so i m surprised she expected us to swallow it like some other reviewers here i thought it was more lust than love it was clearly a mid life crisis hook up for patrick and if rosamund truly loved patrick she never would have left him when he was ill memory loss or not not planning to read either rosamund or phillipa the other books in this series it was hard enough getting through this book let alone another one with her uppity daughter the good stuff getting to meet patrick leslie again but it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter janet decades ago if you ve read the kadin you know that janet eventually returns to her home but only after patrick has died,negative
i love to read great books like brave new world by aldous huxley or far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy i love the aeneid by virgil the odyssey by homer i read both long versions of les miserables and the hunchback of norte dame by victor hugo i read the rise and fall of the roman empire by gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so i love to read but great expectations was a great disappointment i was somewhat amused until chapter ten where i felt the book became psycho babble i was also disappointed in tale of two cities i could not endure the first two chapters dickens did a fine job on the christmas carol but i will never read another of his books,negative

this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework writing a book is no small feat and technical books are a special beast with that last statement in mind this is were the book sadly falls short for one the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books code the authors explain \( on the publisher site \) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print while improvement is always good this presents two problems 1 the sample application is now out of sync with the material not a good thing for those trying to learn as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book also and this is not to disparage the authors skill but i buy books because i am expecting experienced if not expert advice if a small sample application needs rewriting perhaps they should write about something else further down this road the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling i suspect that the final build file was not tested or it was a case of well it compiles on my machine there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled thankfully i use eclipse and imported the project eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive examples are jakarta commons collections and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access for an experienced developer familiar with ant and a good ide it was not a lot of trouble to get it running it just did not give me a good impression bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql first no matter what db you swap in you ll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file i made property variables which i placed in build properties then you will need to change the class user to something else \( and of course anything in the app that references it \) another great reason to use eclipse why you must change it is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you can t name a table user,negative
i m writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing gcc members reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting the oil states today face tremendous challenges as oil revenues start to decline few expected that the decline would come so soon everybody knew it would come but it was expected later rather than sooner this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time worth a look if you re interested in the field,positive

this book consists of 29 stand alone essays beautifully written and previously published in the new england journal of medicine during the early seventies from the first chapter the viruses instead of being single minded agents of disease and death now begin to look more like mobile genes we live in a dancing matrix of viruses they dart rather like bees from organism to organism from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again and into the sea tugging along pieces of this genome strings of genes from that transplanting grafts of dna passing around heredity as though at a great party although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates 1 there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things 2 there is constant reference to the interaction symbiosis and co operative living arrangements amongst the different species 3 there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants bees and termites whose activities create sophisticated developed projects without any evidence of central control these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities with the human emphasis being on language 4 the cell is the unit of life complete with all its intricate inner workings the cell membrane \( cell wall in plants \) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible in the first chapter and frequently throughout the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism but he can t make it work too big too complex too many working parts without visible connections then in the last chapter a better analogy emerges the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan richard feynman and stephen jay gould reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about amazingly after 30 years there is a little but not much in this book that is out of date if you are a little rusty on biology have your oxford dictionary of science handy first class,positive

this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 000 years across the continents diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali yali s question was why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea but we black people had little cargo of our own reading the book i think i gulped at this point this sounds like a classic loaded question it sounds disturbingly close to why have we \( europe and its former colonies \) succeeded where they have failed diamond does not descend into that territory though but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely there are references to a culture s success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing for instance the advantages of a hunting gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia this history can probably be described \( or perhaps is most successful \) as based around environmental causation \( as opposed to the racial ethnic social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing \) descriptions of climate \( note that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age \) longitudinal or latitudinal axes elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity still it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title guns europe s refinement of this technology was based on china s innovations with gunpowder today s dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated as an interesting counterpoint japan had owned more and better guns in c 1600 ce than any country in the world samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology japan wouldn t resume manufacture until mid 19th century obviously there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry s influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today germs epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn t survive smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals \( and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate \) interesting note the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease \( likely smallpox \) rather than guns steel technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities a hunter gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things first there appears to need to be sustainable farming many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region \( where today we invade suck oil and force the conquered to endure freedom \) the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop as a complete side note the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself compared to africa and the americas eurasia is mainly west east axis versus north south movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal something like corn \( maize \) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography llamas and guinea pigs \( which could be useful for pack animals and food \) never made it north conversely all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle horses pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe to answer yali s question some of the answer is luck africa australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had some other is environmental determinism where you are helps make up who you become for going forward diamond cites transportation communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future after word harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up but not as fully developed here that of pre clovis native american discoveries \( pronouncements \) knowingly confronting a loaded racial ethnocentric question in a folio called might white of you are american archaeologists white supremacists the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000 11000 bce there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive one wonders if the pre clovis discovery \( especially all the business about caucusoid skulls \) isn t so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide,positive

in self hypnosis for women c alexander and annellen simpkins have created an instrument a book and cd combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar practitioner of hypnosis the simpkins have masterfully crafted this guide to self guidance weaving explanation and experience throughout the written and spoken words provided are tools useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on the journey of being human while true to its title self hypnosis for women offering examples of utilization directly fashioned to experiences idiosyncratic to women menstruation pregnancy labor and delivery and menopause the title of this work belies its more universal applicability to components of life common to both women and men self image pain management overcoming fear and anxiety and finding personal balance the book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the most benefit for individual readers those who may wish to skip over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their journey in later chapters those who are new to the practice of hypnosis or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from others perspectives are offered just that in the earlier chapters the story of hypnosis and the modern history and research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of identified systematic trancework from mesmer charcot and freud to the contributions of hilgard hull and milton h erickson they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey through current and future directions including their own paths on which they are about to embark the simpkins define suggestion as a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then transformed through unconscious processing into an action experience attitude or concept \( p 45 \) this presentation of suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the development of a personal ability to self guide together the book and cd promote the utilization of both conscious and unconscious processes as learning tools assisting in the transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness to components of life which offers guidance and assistance specific hypnotic techniques are explained and accompanied by exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure the framework for these exercises is the suggestion of an experiment with that particular technique creating an environment for the learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility of failure the only opportunity not offered is that of incompetence there is only a place to try adjust and retry each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set based on personal significance and comfort more than a bonus the accompanying cd is a work of art on its own again mixing explanation with experiential learning this auditory tool incorporates fractalization as a teaching method to assist the listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of trance exploration a vast canvas is provided upon which the hypnotic partner can create motor auditory and visual experiences with encouragement and assistance rather than direction or interference a respectful approach not always found in self hypnosis recordings sharon mclaughlin ma managing editor milton h erickson newsletter,positive

this is the worst book of shakespeare criticism i have ever read bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next it reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly handed to a graduate student and entered into a computer over a weekend he contradicts himself several times i donated my copy to the library as soon as i was done reading it so i cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur but several times i recall reading a passage where bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier to make matters worse he even says the bard contradicts himself he points to supposed paradoxes regarding hamlet s age stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30 apparently the point is that if shakespeare contradicts himself so can bloom bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that hamlet is a slacker he has not grown up yet that is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom some of the book s observations are interesting but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from bloom s notes interespersed between the passages scribbled down from bloom s lectures are outbursts where bloom reminds us that shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer in verse or prose who ever lived bloom is a great critic when he still tries but in this book he was not even trying,negative

alliterative analogies assertively assembled appear aplenty appropriately apt and artful absorbing attention ad infinitum this could be a fitting summary of abish s stunningly now novel written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between kabbala and alliteration chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter a chapter 2 with a and b and so on until chapter 27 when z first then chapter by chapter all other letters are progressively subtracted in spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary they may have been culled from today s headlines polysexually inclined thugs hide in africa after a crime spree with the author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them chasing after the thugs from country to country we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite war and genocide corrupted burocrats and soldiers rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air where sparsely assembled people wollow in african indolence all is narrated with poetic detachment in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality it is just that the words were limited by my artifice reader the author seems to smile no harm intended perhaps the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974 to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy great art when unhindered relates to the whole of time in all tenses while amusing abish has managed a ponderous read which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add subtract letter scheme and wonder was it accidental in order to be perfect all i lack is a defect goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet,positive

though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii there are some great ones to pick from for instance for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i try the doughboys by gary mead for a good look at the events of gallipoli just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne the list goes on and on whether it be flanders the somme passchendaele africa jutland whatever your area of interest might be the point i m making is there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i and even several overviews of the war but john keegan s the first world war is a great source for an overall study of the war this book covers it all in brief detail accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here i ve never been a big fan of keegan his writing to me is a struggle at times this book is no exception it reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and borders on tedious at times but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style he is a virtual historical genius his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted and he writes for the most part without imparting his own commentary in fact without prior knowledge one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself british the big exception to that is keegan s typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues in this aspect he even contradicts himself in several places he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of 1918 germany was still very much capable of winning the war the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front the new soldiers from the east brought with them battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph as they had in the east he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how though ambitious and courageous the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war when he does acknowledge american victory it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces that said if you re seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months this book will infuriate you however if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole this is one of the best out there i should add the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study monty rainey,positive

we have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science math and technological education for everyone the first one occurred after the sputnik fiasco when the russians beat us in the race to reach space the concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the american association for the advancement of science and educators saw in comparison of assessments made of students in the u s and those in other developed countries such as japan the answer to this concern was for the aaas along with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific literacy and what the public in the u s should at least know to be scientifically literate as usual though the aaas addressed the fact that certain groups in the u s were not being included in the pursuit of science literacy such as women and racial minorities in this their first book they skipped over those of us with disabilities since this is a major concern of mine and the area in which i do research i was appalled to see they neglected us once again especially as the aaas has a separate department dealing with the disabled deaf in spite of this mistake the writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that our country can be more scientifically literate with new information being made available through newspapers and the internet on a daily basis it is absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race gender or ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care decisions on employment \( since health care is one of the top employers in the u s today \) and to teach their children this book was the beginning but it isn t the end more books have further elucidated what is required for science literacy from both the aaas and other science groups this is the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their students to become scientifically literate karen sadler science education university of pittsburgh klsst23 pitt ed,positive

the above is an actual quote from the book i don t usually read romances but got this one at the library i thought thriller hijacked plane navy seal all the right stuff and the beginning was promising stan fixes everything and has a human side to him that was compelling then the plot hit the fan as a thriller it stunk the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly as an after thought the romantic tension between the protagonists was forced and irritating the dialogue is mundane the message that horniness leads to true romantic \( sam and alyssa \) love is rubbish the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed the historic \( wwii \) componant was interesting but overall i kept asking who the audience is for this book not lovers of thrillers like me and i wonder do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him,negative

even if somehow bin laden did pick up this book and for some reason decide to read it he would not stick with it to learn the lesson that his victims are real average struggling people the fictional letter diary to bin laden from the mother of a fictional attack victim from an arsenal chelsea soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring bin laden would give it away before learning what the author wants him to the mother just waffles on and on and on and on and on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in any paragraph if bin laden is ever captured maybe force him to read this as torture or something also why does chris cleve chose to glorify bin ladden by crediting him with a new attack when lets face it he hasn t achieved much since september 11 2001 other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave somewhere this book would have been more realistic and made more sense as a letter to the ira hezbollah hamas islamic jihad or one of the current more frequently operating groups alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional character on one of the planes or in the world trade centre a good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank extremely boring,negative
i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book not quite as bad as her book impossible but close danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing basically this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn t realize how much she meant to him until she was dying dead drivel she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves but no a waste of time very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all disappointing to say the least,negative

steven pinker has written a fascinating account of how language works how we as listeners process the sounds that make up words and sentences in a way that allows us to extract meaning the book is clear entertaining and very accessible pinker s writing style is witty and engaging my appreciation of the book is not only as a reader and enthusiast of language but also as a writer despite having been writing for years and having studied numerous books on writing style and technique it is the language instinct that positively impacted my writing more than anything else that i ve read an understanding \( at least a partial one i m no expert \) of the way your words will be parsed by the brain of your reader can be very valuable in one s attempt to write clearly and well i highly highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning something new and being entertained in the process danny iny author of ordinary miracles harness the power of writing and get your point across \( isbn 1 4116 7252 6,positive
i was optimistic when i saw the title but you know that old saying don t judge a book by its cover the author has a few legitimate ideas but any google search could come up with the same information in greater depth and better accuracy she condemns saving animals from shelters and actually encourages people to breed animals to increase the pet population she is no more a pet lover than i am a supermodel her ideas are based solely on money even if it encourages starting a puppy mill \( euphemistically referred to as a dog breeder \) early in her book she mentions the titles of a few other books she recommends \( i have chosen not to seek them out \) but she says don t spend your money on them just go to the library and check them out if you insist on reading this book i give you the same advice do not buy this book check it out from your local library then do google searches to get more in depth accurate information about any of the four decent ideas she did have or come back to amazon com and find a more specific book that can actually be of use oh and by the way the world is already overpopulated with unwanted pets encouraging people to add to the problem is morally reprehensible,negative
ms wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of literary criticism or a biography the book suffers from too much critical analysis of sassoon s poetry and not enough about his life either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or ms wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life ms wilson s prose is turgid and repetitive an extremely disappointing work,negative

i was intrigued by the title which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity well after 60 pages or so i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life but i say that any religious life \( be it christian islam or otherwise \) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional i am convinced that yoda is a zen master the force is derived from tao not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion \( i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism which is another beast altogether \) a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is the dharma of star wars,negative

the greatest paragraph in all of singer is the one at the beginning of his story shosha where he says he knew two dead languages hebrew and aramaic and was educated to read about the cultic requirements of a temple which had not existed for 1900 years he knew yiddish which he considered perhaps not a language at all and that although his ancestors had lived in poland for five or six hundred years he knew only a few words of polish although he lived in poland for all of his youth until he came to america nothing says more about the unhealthy state of the jews than this zionists should use this quote as the supreme justification for their idea that jewish life in the diaspora was very disfunctional and certainly unhealthy,positive
melrose larry green s book is full of quotes quotes and information used to back up points are good things he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others this is all fine and acceptable the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author \( cut and paste expert \) attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited his points are not linear and show the author s attention deficit with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one sided sensationalized talk radio program,negative

this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family s experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder s work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride doesn t manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction,negative
one of the things i like about this book for young readers is that the same vocabulary words are repeated throughout the series so that the kids can build on what they learned in one book while they re reading the next at first i was disappointed with the series since i didn t think it did justice to the little house series that i treasured myself as a girl after a few reads however i see that the magic of laura ingalls wilder s stories shines through in this series with renee graef s illustrations how else do you explain to a four year old what a log cabin is really like i am surprised how many how and why questions this series has provoked regarding this book in particular my daughter asked about a million questions about the maple syrup making process,positive
peter allen takes three of the most compelling aspects of human history sex disease and religion and weaves them together in a fascinating exposition of how religious authorities in the west have viewed disease since the late middle ages his book discusses the histories of lovesickness leprosy syphilis plague masturbation and of course aids for each disease \( and yes masturbation was considered a serious disease well into the 20th century \) he discusses how sex and the sins associated with it figured into the religious and popular views of illness allen s book is meticulously researched \( he read texts in the original french latin german and italian \) and elegantly written it is a far easier read than most academic works most importantly it offers insight into how religious and sexual intolerance can hamper the fight against disease even in today s world,positive
a wonderful wonderful book although the book was written some 150 year ago mary eliza rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in palestine in the 1850 s as if it was occurring today she writes from her heart with honesty integrity and a clear mind and although written at a time of victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement from her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the holy land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change for anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book,positive
i like evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible the stephanie plum and joe morelli relationship sustained through 12 books so far being a case in point but full scoop was actually a trial to get through i could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted evanovich s comedic rhythm the whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what i have come to expect from evanovich the silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened the least forgivable of the sins committed in full scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between maggie and zack none at all so it s hard to label the book a sort of but not really romance an almost but not much of a woman in danger maybe a new genre altogether the slapstick thriller,negative
my two boys ages 3 and 2 both pull this book off the shelf over and over i use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary \( both in english and spanish \) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers \( also in both languages \) as well as colors it s a great addition to the workbook flip flop spanish and also just for fun my littlest a one year old girl even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them they re sturdy pages full of all kinds of things the kind of book you find something new each time you open it it has little lists to find items as well,positive

i bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me however the information provided is too extensive and confusing listing far too many points in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them the body map listing them is in the first part of the book so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to i also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous the way this system originated is also a little murky this is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public,negative
a few years ago i had the pleasure of meeting pam munoz ryan at a summer arts children s storytelling forum held at california state university fresno she read the book to parents teachers and students who attended the conference i was amazed on the writing culture and illustrations that she used for this book the novel serves as a tale of her childhood spending time with her family at her grandmother s house overall the story teaches children the value of traditions family and heritage in short mice and beans is a good book to read,positive

typee is based on melville s experiences when as a young man of 22 he jumped ship from an american whaling vessel on the island of nukuheva in the marquesas islands of the south pacific it is written in a straightforward narrative manner but it is a work of fiction not a journalistic report something that is often overlooked while like moby dick it contains lots of factual details mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface for a first novel written when melville was only 27 years old the narrative power is quite impressive as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the valley of the typee in the early chapters themes of peace beauty and sensuality are combined with melville s righteous indignation at the activities of western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise gradually dread loneliness horror and fear of annihilation come to the fore as tommo the protagonist becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast he is finally rescued almost by chance and because of conflict among the typees i read the oxford world s classics paperback edition which has an introduction by ruth blair an australian professor of english it was very helpful with melville s historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context the chapter on typee in studies in classic american literature by d h lawrence adds a further depth of understanding newton arvin s biography of melville helps to place typee in the development of melville as a writer highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century american romanticism with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of moby dick,positive
one tiresome heavy handed simile after another agonizing descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action simplistic trite phrasing and dialogue characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat routine characterization a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable proofreading errors fragmented poor sentence structure this book is amateurish writing all the way around i cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received i cannot understand the lack of proper editing i am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm so imagine my disappointment when i was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the prologue in fairness to the author \( and with a hopeful attitude \) i forced myself through the first 70 or so pages however with each turning page i found myself reading along just for sport my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous \( and annoyed \) with this juvenile effort what could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time,negative

first the story takes place in the 1940s \( harold s brother is mia in wwii not in vietnam as the amazon com review erroneously states \) second the writing is superb mr lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel his characters are very real his setting \( a small struggling circus traveling the western u s \) is historically believable peopled with freaks who suffer as sideshows unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with but peopled also with normals who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks harold the 14 year old albino central character tries to straddle both groups of people he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer i am admittedly ignorant about such things but mr lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants crucial to the plot of the novel seem believable my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end i do want you to read this book so i will try not to give anything away here but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character s last words and even gomer pyle like \( people actuallly say gosh \) this did detract from the impact of the death unfortunately but i still very strongly recommend this book five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot,positive

i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour races religions nationality and creed \( all women are equal in my eyes nigel \) in this remarkable novel sk makes his debut an unlikely but good book it has a good dose of horror suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read it is simply about a teenager from maine named carietta white \( carrie \) from the beginning of the story we see who her mother \( margaret white \) takes advantage of her making her feel stupid and left out similiarly in school carrie is always the black sheep she has not friends and she is always picked upon she is very unusual and strange at least to most people especially the ones in the book \( story \) \( but i would say quite frankly that i didn t see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl \) at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her this is her first big humiliation \( i am a guy i know not much about a period so please forgive my use of the term openly \) anyway back to the plot carrie soon realizes that she is psychic she starts to practice using her powers gradually it seems as though she had the powers since birth but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it so so far we see this a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end allow me it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic carrie s mother explains alot of things but she is still a bad mother \( but i still can t hate carries s mother because most mothers are sort of protective over their children \) soon carrie gets her first friend sue sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom this date is tommy ross meanwhile one of the bad girls chris is unable to attend the prom so she sets up a nasty revenge against carrie believe me when i tell you chris is a very jealous girl and if she can t have something no one else can especially carrie so chris arranges a trap for carrie \( two buckets of pig blood \) she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie s and tommy s head while at the prom the plan eventually succeeds tommy is badly injured drenched in pig s blood carrie is laughed at for the last time she runs out of the building she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge she starts to close all the doors she then turns on all the water sprinklers wetting everyone but with a combination of water and electricity \( from the appliances \) some were electrocuted eventually a fire gets started and things start to burn she walks toward her home burning everything within a certain radius of her powers when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her telling her that she is the spawn of satan she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers heart beat killing her eventually \( this is the good part of the book \) while carrie is walking on the streets \( going i don t know where \) she seens chris and chris s boyfriend driving towards her to bounce her carrie uses her powers to diverge to car killing chris and her stupid boyfriend sue eventually catches up with carrie carrie doesn t kill her because she realizes that it wasn t sue s falt but chris s \( during the battle with her mother carrie was stabbed i forgot to mention it sorry \) so now talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just dies \( this is the sad part i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes or maybe not \) but this book is definitely good i recommend it with all my psychic powers enjoy this review was written by nigel,positive
i was reading about my son it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense really talked about a framework of letting the decision making \( and the consequence of their decision \) remain with the teen then half way the book screeched in a new direction all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view when it comes to sex the authors don t want you to leave the decision with the teens they want to take that one back which weakens the premise they present the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position which i would have respected if not agreed with then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the conversation solution if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system i wouldn t have spent the 22 i would have wanted to know that in advance tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book buyer bewar,negative

one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters sunny randall and jesse stone robert b parker has doubled our fun quite the reverse he has cut it in half the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes either sunny s irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more the villains buddy erin missy gerard moon are little more than vague names and stereotyping spike is relegated to a scene and a half oddly the only interesting character is a very minor one eddie but he only stays around for 10 minutes even the plot is tissue thin the love story is lame the sex scenes boring worst of all who should appear but \( christ \) susan silverman from the spenser series one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction as with cold service and some others parker is just coasting with this one he is capable of far better,negative
a gold sticker on this book s cover reads winner of the nobel prize for literature don t be mislead the sticker must refer to the author not the book while he no doubt received the prize after wading through the work i can t believe it was for this piece of work i found the book exceedingly boring a chore to read every step of the way as the iberian peninsula physically separates from europe several unengaging and underdeveloped characters \( the most interesting of which was a dog \) wander from one destination to another with meager purposes certainly none i cared about while the book may have been intended as an allegory for portugal s relationship with the rest of europe and the european union it failed to strike a chord i ll chalk this book up as something only a pulitzer prize judge would love,negative

i first read this book back in the mid 80s after watching the miniseries starring gary cole as dr jeffrey macdonald the miniseries absolutely riveted me as did this book but upon repeated readings i began to pick up inaccuracies and errors i found that the book rather than answering questions about this case caused me to question more and more joe mcginniss while never a stellar writer to begin with was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose which was to sell his theory and therefore his book i have nothing against mr mcginniss forming his own opinion as to dr macdonald s guilt or innocence but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening if you want joe mcginniss theory on how and why the murders happened with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence pick this book up if you want to read about the case with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning dr macdonald do as other reviewers have suggested and read fatal justice a far more in depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion,negative

bob quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era but his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we d least like to go inside ourselves i found this an incredibly powerful book i ve used sections of it with my change management classes for several years and i know it has a tremendous impact on students who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy if you want a simple formula for change don t buy this book although it is full of practical actionable ideas change the world addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for it s a very difficult but rewarding assignment,positive

honestly i thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive the author s main point although interesting seems to me like it would fit into an essay also the particular print of the book that i purchased has a dog on the cover i was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior instead i felt i little duped most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments theories or anedoctal accounts of my friend s dog fido one day did this i hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population i mean the author doesn t even have a dog i suspect that i who have had a lifelong history with dogs have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author i don t recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there now if your thing is cows get this book,negative

ageless body is deepak s attempt to neutralize the word old as in old age the writer has a knack for making common words like body mind and self into profound concepts his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound if you like poetry deepak may be your read the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life \( p 36 \) or try to interpret this one the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born \( p 40 \) at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over intelligent design he can t accept the growth of any cell even a plant cell without an intelligence involved he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p 115 asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself whether your word game tosses in the word quantum or not doesn t change much what a solipsistic thought what a solipsistic world i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of wouldn t after awhile go insane,negative

this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco an informer and sleuth a series of books that have become hugely popular so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements that would be and should be found in rome in ad70 but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather well the weather is best left to its own devices marcus has lost his heart to senator s daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated why is that women he is not interested in fall over themselves to get to him but the one that he has lost his heart to treats him with a cool disdain he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book falco is not happy it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way will falco ever return,positive

it s fascinating to compare my own experiences having lived now 3 years in germany to those of an american from 125 years earlier i ve been learning to speak german and his appendix on the awful german language was hilarious in poking fun at german grammar \( e g long sentences \) he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing the scene riding the glacier down the alps was so funny i had tears running down my face it s amazing to think that it was written in 1879 when america was barely a century old and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly eerily similar to either my or typical american s attitudes today i d recommend it to anyone but particularly to anyone visiting or living in europe it s way funnier than his innocents abroad which is also a good read on travel in europe,positive
this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u s administrations in that sense it is the story of two cities miami and washington and two peoples americans and cubans i have an objection though with the stone hard style in which this volume is so meticulously even gorgeously at times written didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and worse the result is a cold humorless colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup the author in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end readers it is in that sense a boring little disaster of a book,negative

i recently finished reading this book this is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour it would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself while i am not qualified to comment on these reviews one thing i can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it a theory that too developed quarter century ago can not be expected to stand 100 vindicated today the more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to so may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things after reading this book i could find out why i behave the way i behave mostof the times to a certain extent i learnt to control my responses also i have a feeling that the claims made by dr harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge then prevalent second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people i think this conclusion is far from correct dr harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to i am not ok and you are ok category out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual the objective here is not to merely categorize but to show that how most of us have the common position i am not ok and you are ok now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses third critisism on this book stems from the fact dr harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100 it seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100 with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon i don t think dr harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100 the books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals \( with whom he does not agree 100 \) for the benefit of the reader to call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself i feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers read this book with an open mind read the chapeters on pac and marriage pac and children pac and social implications pac and moral values in this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day it tries to teach something good \( and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute \) thanks,positive

noah webster s book is fascinating reading for today s students and teachers alike as well as for the average citizen as there is much to learn from it while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text it certainly has a place in every school library one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used with diacritical marks \( accents \) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants words are divided according to syllables and stress it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching the terminology of traditional grammar is used and there are copious word lists with words grouped according to common factors i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects \( now archaisms thy thou foreign words and phrases abbreviations explained punctuation etc \) this book should remain a spelling classic,positive

anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the left behind series since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture indeed the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house and christian or not who hasn t heard of the term antichrist or the significance of the number 666 this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology including the role of israel russia the arab countries europe and the united states it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years \( turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along \) the final chapter written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union demonstrates how once again premillenial thought adjusts itself \( or sometimes not \) depending upon world conditions this is a fair even handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon,positive
i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001 then it was a mere idea from that time on until august 20th 2002 i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover patriot that he is but also a flag i loved it couldn t be more happy well the day of the book s release i took a day off work \( i ve never missed a day of work before in my life \) and rushed to get this book it looked better than i ever imagined with the flag on the cover and the title of let freedom ring i thought finally technology has caught up to our patriotism i expected a book filled with flags flags with sound effects maybe some firework sound effects boy was i wrong i opened the book only to the colors black and white no red no blue no stars and stripes i quickly turned the pages looking searching for flags i found none no sound effects either no fireworks at that point i went into a 4 year long depression i nearly committed suicide at several points it s only now that i can bring myself to review this man s book patriot that he is i say this so you know what you re getting yourself into there are no flags no stars and stripes no fireworks no sound effects i have since recovered but only because of old stars and stripes i went back to teaching last year not fully recovered and my colleagues knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes suggested i have my class do a research project find the most patriotic book ever made the methodoloy was simple a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest we found some very good books and they did cheer me up the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called president jesus how jesus wrote the constitution freed the slaves and won world war ii its published by a small church in texas i was very proud of my students for finding it it has brought countless joy to my life along with the book made entirely out of a flag with flag pictures and written in blue and red ink you get a giant flag i m not sure of the dimensions but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck i ve draped it over my house and it covers it completely people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time smiling,negative
i love peterson s guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell s or edward s guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone howell s is certainly the most complete but edward s guide is a bit handier in the field,negative

while the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive what i think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics an example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter but doesn t go into detail on how to tie the structural members together he just tells you that you need to tie them together what if you don t have a shoelace to use what other alternates are there this book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire but it s not enough for the serious camper,negative
alright so her childhood was a bit different than your average white middle income childhood should this motivate anybody to write a completely non imaginative devoid of any insights book don t be fooled by the exotic side of it a poor writer can ruin a story regardless of the exotic locale if you were expecting to find an international jewel like jhumpa lahiri s the namesake or zadie smith s on beauty you will be greatly disappointed if you are into africa read something that has more than the exotic place to say for itself ben okri s the famished road \( booker prize winner \) or the palm wine drinkard and my life in the bush of ghosts \( paperback \) by amos tutuola will be much better choices,negative
it s disturbing to see how many mistakes i found just browsing through this colorful attractive book though the state bird of alabama is known locally as yellowhammer you will not find that name in any field guide the accompanying picture was no help either in identifying what turned out to be the common flicker other state birds were listed by uncommon incorrect misleading names too the 1995 bombing in oklahoma city is represented by a nice picture and writeup but with a glaring misspelling in its headline in memorium should be in memoriam claremore ok is misspelled as clarmore on the map these errors leaped out at me just flipping through the pages this is very disappointing and makes me wonder what other misinformation this book contains adults have some knowledge and experience against which to measure what they read schoolchildren who may be learning facts for the first time need the facts to be correct,negative
this story should have and could have been really good it presents a great concept but the story is just so poorly crafted it is very sexist the prose is stiff and the plot is dull i will concede that it was interesting at times it kept me reading but i really didn t get much out of it i can only praise heinlein for including the intelligent conversation which takes place after the press conference where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn the whole story is just very odd do read it though it s a title to read if you wish to be considered well read despite its faults valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten just as we will never forget atticus from to kill a mockingbird,negative
the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological philosophical foundations of the emerging confession there is value in that i look forward to reading part two the liturgical ideas section the emerging church is keen on praxis but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom which i had hoped we were past here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book which it might help to know 1 rollins does not think it s possible to really know much theology with certainty in fact to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an idolatrous view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans and because in his view god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views he is very certain of his interpretations of perceptive thinkers like nietzsche freud and marx eckhart augustine etc and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really really faulty as i m reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament so be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible s basic content he is certain that no one should be certain but him ok to be fair he is not certain if christianity is true and says so on page 44 but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity nor i guess should you with his view of critique of ideology how can he be so selective of what he is certain of this seems like a self defeating ideology so strong is his disdain for knowing with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer in my opinion he says the church is not to be about giving answers but helping raise in people questioning indeed given his views how could he provide answers this book may look deep i propose it is merely muddy 2 he redefines age old terms orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes but how loosely one holds it certainty of revealed truth is dangerous misinformed idolatrous heresy is now a cute little thing it has come of age he says people will think his views undermine christianity we are to just take him at his word that his views won t do so but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would i think see the writing on the wall 3 he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns those like himself at least to even understand the gospel he has not how can he be a bridge to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down not without mystery nor without debate but in a very real and tangible way he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else 4 he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them the problem that is huge and no one seems to notice is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps he considers fundamentalists and by logical extension many evangelicals to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term heresy i kept thinking what kind of fundamentalists is he so angry at he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals making generalizations that are misleading very unobjective unkind very divisive yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom i can see his views bringing unity to all religions but it will never bring unity to christendom he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom times have really changed in the past 20 years he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind 5 he makes god hopelessly difficult god wanted it seems to speak in a plain brown wrapper the common language of the people the dust of humanity the lowly donkey ride the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining human reason as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said i am the truth into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it god s message is simple it s clear where it needs to be it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated rollins makes it nearly all enigma hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it yet who has been unwilling or incapable given man s weaknesses or his own lack of communication skills to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly if as tickle says this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man s religion the anything goes religion and following generations will have to deconstruct today s extreme and irrational over reaction to fundamentalism peter i can learn some stuff from you and i m sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points your views trouble me nothing against you personally forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more though it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor regardless if it inspires i ll come back and add a star hmmm,negative

this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown s career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection cynthia rose s living in america the soul saga of james brown geoff brown s biography james brown and ofcourse the brown tucker the godfather of soul james brown all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician s mind but this one has a stronger narrative a bit less guarded his late 80s fall is described in a more contrite way for example his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men then immediately moves on to the next thought even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality obviously directed at the female fans ever recorded similarly his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap hip hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self righteous there is alot of adult content in his catalogue which can t be explained away as art however fans can trace his development into more cerebral music with more and more sensitive ballads and socially conscious tunes being produced from the late 60s on i was happy to read his description of little richard s assistance in his early career but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor the influence is quite obvious and not just on chonnie on chon another depressing ommission is with marva whitney his popular lead female vocalist from c 67 to 70 a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup despite the above concerns with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world just listen to don t be a drop out i don t want nobody to give me nothing the man in the glass i m not demanding it s christmas time and peace in the world,positive

not many writers can characterize children realistically somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff this is definately not one of those novels carson mccullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters f jasmine and john henry west i really cannot think of another story maybe a good man is hard to find by flannery o conner where the writer can get inside the mind of a child evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease john henry west is one of the most well rounded and well written children i have ever read and that is a great homage to her writing ability i first read this at ten can see that age or older reading it will have a intense impact on a sensitive pre teen reader,positive
when one begins to despair about the quality \( or lack thereof \) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that i finished all too quickly i could not get enough of it the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly his employer a lord darlington is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans and what did mr stevens think of this he didn t he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr stevens you ll have to read the book if you want to know more i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not if you get this book you will not be sorry,positive
this book was a huge disappointment sue grafton and kinsey meander all over california but come up with nothing of substance the author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive the characters and their actions are bogus and contrived for example kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before it doesn t work because it isn t real it is sue grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess the story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters when it was all over i still didn t know why the murders had been committed save your eyesight do not bother picking up this book,negative

i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality blamires had c s lewis as a tutor and i ve read some of lewis s writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special \( many people do find his works special of course \) blamires on the other hand i find to be very unique his book is top quality and very helpful i m surprised this isn t a very popular book as it ought to be i have only two complaints both of which are purely stylistic first the edition i have looks like it s a copy of an earlier edition which makes the text hard to read \( i got used to it after a while though \) some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it my second criticism is something that can t be avoided the book was originally written in the early sixties so a lot of the examples are dated \( i e references to wwii which was still in memory also out of date terms like jive etc \) however just a few of the examples are affected by this the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work since so much blamires s criticism of the christian mind \( or lack thereof \) still \( sadly \) applies however the christian mind today is being rediscovered and the march of atheism is on the decline with the march of religion in general on the rise even though things are looking up christians should keep blamires s book in mind not to get too comfortable with this \( secular \) world for our real home is beyond bodily death that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book superb book and i really recommend this to anyone this is definitely recommended for christians and also for any non christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today,positive

i have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost 5 years now last year i had over 1400 seedlings on multi level shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room \( boy do i need a greenhouse \) so this book was not a lot of new information to me a lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet but it s not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before i buy it \( this is important because i m not interested in refrigerating my seeds 3 weeks before i plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds \) one major thing missing from this book was photography there were drawings but i m sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool on the good side this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant \( annual perennial etc \) its hardiness zone and its flowering season this allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone the regular index wasn t very useful but one wonderful addition was an index of the common latin names i refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography i was missing \( almost makes up for it almost \) of course there is the standard hardiness zone map but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates \( nice \) also included was a directory of seed companies and their addresses all in all this book does a good job of covering the seed part but a poor job of covering the bloom part,positive

this book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of mysql this is a thick book that covers a lot of material the last chapters even provided introductions to application development with c perl and php mysql the complete reference really seemed like an actual complete reference while it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic most of the focus was on sql \( structured query language \) though there were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors for one thing you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise also it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so i could follow along in more of the examples frequently my result set wouldn t quite match the one in the book additionally some of the command wouldn t even execute or would return an error message lastly the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages but i believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that i was running mysql on windows although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a unix installation also mysql would be several versions newer on my computer i believe that made a difference on some of the results as well and for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested gui programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt so i wasn t quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another nevertheless there were still plenty of quality examples i could follow along in in addition there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material overall this book works well as a reference or for working the chapters in order even though the book s user level isn t indicated i believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner,positive
i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book this is not a book about cosmology \( as people would expect from roger penrose \) in this tiny book penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes \( something much different from the opinion of 99 99 of neurobiologists such as steven pinker \) this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell mann the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories \( thus the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works \) some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn t had in mind that this book is about penrose s point of view on intelligence in fact i m not a physicist nor a biologist simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand although i do not agree with penrose s point of view i think he forgot something very important read it and read the other point of view and you ll find what it is,positive

shadowbred by paul kemp is simply an excellent book the story is incredibly engrossing the atmosphere set for each scene is really top notch and the journey paul takes his character s through is really incredible we see personal demons and struggles of the heroes struggles with faith the journey of an anti hero to a hero and whether he can really make this journey the villains are equally deep and interesting and frankly human if you are a fan of fantasy literature definitely pick this one up you won t regret it as a side note you might want to pick up the previous books by paul featuring erevis cale as well,positive
why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust confidence and cons though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u s exploded into civil war its insights cross cultural boundaries this is not an easy book to read for several reasons first it is undoubtedly one of the first post modern novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling \( another example dostoevsky s notes from the underground \) the confidence man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat beggars absurdly dressed frontiersmen sickly misers shysters patent medicine hucksters veterans \( of the mexican american war \) and the hero in the latter part of the book the cosmopolitan in typical melville fashion you also get asides directly to the reader in several cases as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel the lack of structure action and conclusion make this a post modern type book but if you read each conversation as a separate story then it starts to make more sense for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme the nature of trust and confidence in a very sly way melville shows how a variety of cons are worked as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do buy the herbal patent medicine buy shares in a bogus stock venture or donate cash to a suspect charity in other chapters it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself since the book is mostly conversations we are left to our own conclusions there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust we don t want to be taken but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted to trust no one is to be entirely isolated melville also raises the question is it always a bad thing to be conned the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life the ornery frontiersman who s been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth talking employment agency owner is that a terrible thing to trust despite a history of being burned the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored we think the cosmopolitan is a con man but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum he returns it just to prove a point is that a continuance of the con or is he actually trustworthy the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens in a traditional society things operate in rote ways young people follow in their parents traditional roles money is made and lent according to unchanging standards and faith tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well worn pathways but in america none of this structure is available even in melville s day america was a polyglot culture on the move you had to decide who to trust based on their dress manner and speech pitch the con of course works on precisely this necessity to rely on one s senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods so the con man dresses well and has a good story and an answer for every doubt the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long leisurely clause upon clause sentences but the book is also peppered with his sly humor which sneaks up on you well just like a good con,positive

i m trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i can t decide among the following travels through guilt with the world s 33rd richest hippie the mind of an empty suit a self important revisionist history how i learned to hate myself and love the third world memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy then the moral outrage of this book makes sense but there s a whole lot to swallow on the plus side it s a fast and somewhat entertaining read otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self loathing that takes about 20 years to surface one of the things that i ve had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny as i look at the 20th century i think of most of it focused on the economics of perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america rues the lives of poor peasants and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric but you can t imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx weber engles friere or anyone back when i was a bit more blackified i referred to such people as culture vultures if it s indigenous it s good but you ll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics literacy rates crime rates or even inflation i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil technically you ll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia basically perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is was and always will be the american way you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game it s a confession all right by the time i got 2 3rds of the way through reading the book began to become annoying the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory we learn that he took one of his charges \( female \) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean but that when he got there he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance the best book i ve read is my life as a quant if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy the best book to read is larry kolb s overworld if you want to get well written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era then this is your book but it s nowhere near as good as say the quiet american you can imagine that perkins who is a great admirer of graham greene might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus but he is to honest to consider himself heroic and i suspect that he ll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life in that regard confessions of an economic hitman is \( now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition \) a blueprint for american liberal guilt if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well deserved kharmic smackdown it is john perkins he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine you d think being a pseudo economist that he d have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton ahh but that would mean that he d have to admire courage i didn t want to be a harsh judge of perkins i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life one of conviction and then epiphany instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that corporatocray is evil this book has been a disappointment in many ways i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this good parts yeah there are a few he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders he gives a few details about saudi aramco but compared to larry kolb s fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi this is romper room if perkins thought he was an agent don t make me laugh,negative
please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature read this book yourself before giving it to your child it discusses oral sex anal sex how to use and purchase condoms masturbation \( for girls and boys \) etc when the author discusses exploring your own sexuality she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth as she would have stopped sucking her thumb the cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within it is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve for many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate,negative
the working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology what is being merleau answers in the manner of lao tse and alludes to something like a divine feminine at the heart of wild perception it was said by sartre in his autobiography situations that after merleau s mother died who was like a goddess to him merleau returned began the project anew what is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life and in the end merleau returns to the very object of his study you can really feel this descent at the book nears its end it is however an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension that i assure you,positive
book contains many useful lists charts comparisons to define giftedness many helpful hints about raising a gifted child main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general and may push those with normal kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track when they should not gifted kids are the exception not the norm as this book makes it seem,negative
god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic and yes maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book s great reputation i entered it with high expectations which the book however did not satisfy yes it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time a lampoon of the courtship ritual and of course oh so witty blah blah blah but it just wasn t my cup of tea the main character was likeable but that aside i found it completely insufferable to read through and absolutely painfully boring every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted let alone the ending not that anything really ever happens the entire book could be summed up with then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea walked and talked and had more tea then got married and lived happily ever after the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama it would save more time just to watch a chick flick so if you re interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters witnessing the agony over who s going to marry who \( even though the reader could already predict the happily ever after match making light years in advance \) then this is the book for you if not then i suggest picking up some dan brown,negative

yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn t know how to write my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author s alternative grammatical rules comma splices and run on sentences are not and never will be acceptable to me occasional use can be overlooked but shaara peppers every page with them tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading the following example is made up but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes he turned in the saddle rode toward his headquarters over the ridge refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance focused instead on the day ahead forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run on sentences in a row like this the result is a book that reads like a rough draft or maybe not even that it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft i don t understand how authors get away with publishing such half finished work and i don t understand why readers put up with it another problem is the lack of convincing characterization everyone is vaguely noble here with the exception of a few complete cads washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home i think you get the picture few characters stand out on their own even lafayette is just another young officer the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book and shaara s attempts at making his characters witty never work the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull beyond that i m doubtful about the author s device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter it s fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin s mind but the rest of the time it doesn t work well i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus either i m a lazy reader \( and i m not \) or the device isn t working well in addition this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france and washington green cornwallis and howe in america that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england and the continental congress in america in effect this novel is really about washington s military camp and howe s dinner table which makes the narrative unbalanced some aspects of the story are interesting i enjoy reading about washington s maneuvers and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were and when but i wish now that i d just bought a decent beginner s history on the war most of the book as literary fiction left me cold,negative
though i am not a vogue reader i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w s splashes in the tabloids were all about while the subject is only mildly interesting to me the author s prose reads like a 300 page deposition against anna wintour from everybody who had has a major or minor gripe with her it s a heavy and boring read gossip if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining should remain light and diverting in this book it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it i was very happy to put it down perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job but then again when that time comes anna wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest,negative
overall i think this is a very good book for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around but is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities it also a good track to run on for someone who wants to implement important life changes in an easy step wise fashion there is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone one of the things i most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little by little in eating habits exercise etc this book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense i think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e g eliminated trans fatty acids eating more fiber using more olive oil etc mixed in with some well researched conclusions are dr weil s opinions for example he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen while it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies it is also probably that some of it is on the mark but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate at the least i don t see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people i also like that dr weil takes a holistic approach to health he not only looks at and talks about the body he also addressed stress and relaxation life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health while he is very commercial he is also a harvard trained physician and i do think that he has some very good insights to share while in some ways i think this book can be better i would still recommend it to almost anyone especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits while not every suggestion might be on target i am sure that if someone implemented all the suggestions over eight weeks they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health i have certainly found this to be true and i cheat on some of them,positive

i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the old edition but judging by look inside this book this new english language edition incorporates much material from the old incidentally the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware apparently his taken orthodox name while timothy ware is his original given name in sweden the swedish translation of the orthodox church is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church apparently its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history it also contains chapters on theology and worship in my opinion the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire under islam and in russia both before and during communism of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic orthodox split usually dated to 1054 the author believes that the so called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split however the book must also be read with some reservations the author is after all an orthodox christian himself its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there for instance ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist a very untenable suggestion at other times he is surprisingly liberal for an orthodox for instance he paints mehmet fatih the muslim conqueror of constantinople as a very tolerant ruler i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian even so the orthodox church remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over view of this remarkable christian church,positive
this was an astounding book about an even more astounding woman rachel shilsky a k a ruth mcbride jordan written by one of her 12 children james this book is both biography \( mother \) and autobiography \( child \) a polish jew \( white \) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater virginia ruth met and married two different black men and managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult circumstances in harlem new york not only did she start a baptist church with her husband she coped with a regular dose of racism some significant poverty and still managed to send 12 children to school \( all of whom became professionals and productive citizens \) the book is written by the son but the voice of the mother is registered throughout \( in italic print \) she evades all queries about her background her family in fact any of her history and it is not until much later that the son uncovers her history \( abusive father crippled mother \) and the reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community that was not of her economic racial or religious experience although the book is ostensibly about this man s childhood and his remarkable mother it is also a fascinating glimpse of racism religion and social exclusion in the black communities in new york in the 1960s each of ruth s children experienced a certain unease about their racially different mother and yet each became aware of who they were and what they were about this book is just a marvelous read full of funny and sad tales of a rather unique family life mcbride s work is a tribute to his extraordinary mother,positive
i ll start with the positive the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word tall good looking smart humble etc the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words in short it was a competent work of fiction that s where my praise ends because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas sure it s a work of fiction no one is going to take it seriously yada yada yada but that s not true is it so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged just look at the reviews to find the believers alright here are my problems with it first politicians are corrupt and will sell out anyone to maintain power but that s not true if you re a conservative farm boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state in term limits vince flynn just beats you over the head with the power corrupts mantra he doesn t show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist you know what though there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what s right who really are trying to make a difference for the positive for this nation and the citizens in this book however the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren t smart enough to make good decisions second murder is a viable answer this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy land come on get real this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn t balance the budget and they get away with it because it s really the right side to be on murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation that being elections elections apparently just get in the way third the balanced budget for years and years until the time this book was written conservatives cried about the budget the book makes it the central theme balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible it s important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel a coup yet when the conservatives did take power despite vince flynn s prescient forecasting ability they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn t flinch even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility they claim that now the deficit isn t a big deal that it s really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90 s and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later it s like looking back in time to a parade of nit wits fourth the good guys don t do bad things the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents just the politicians the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it killing is good when only your target dies but whatever happened to that oh so famous though shalt not cv ric,negative
as with many of the for dummies series controlling cholesterol is a well executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol author carol rinzler s light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why target values for cholesterol can differ in different people there s an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins sugar busters and protein power pluses and minuses of each ten cholesterol myths in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients \( in my cardiology practice \) one criticism like all books about cholesterol controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack this is patently untrue but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol there are better ways nonetheless this book does serve its intended purpose very well educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol,positive

isn t it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem to which you say yeah yeah that s me and then gives you no answer or a weak one to which you say no duh i m afraid this book is one of them the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you ve only dreamed of or at least point you in the right direction to get started but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we can t have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven i don t believe that s the abundant life jesus promised so i went to the bible \( i should have gone there first \) i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart ps 37 4 so i set out to seek him i started reading knowing god by j i packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire i hope you ll find them too in him,negative
the plot of this book was interesting and it could have been a good book unfortunately it wasn t the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem even many of the the secondary characters are weak miserable people the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a dirty little nobody once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards because she is the daughter of a cit he can t imagine why she has any reservations about the deal he says charming things to her like how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway now that s romance meanwhile even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times she finds herself drawn to him too for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim she never stood up for herself and you felt sorry for her of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter including her in fact just about the only one who doesn t know is the hero which provides the dilemma he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn t a nobody will anyone tell him will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn t good enough for him will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn t think she is good enough for him to marry of course it all works out and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him ugh this could have been a good book if the mystery had been handled better and the characters were written differently as is it is a sad regency tale,negative
i had a chance to read this book cover to cover all i can say is absolutely outstanding short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field very rarely do i encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well it is optimally reader friendly the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts new concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully i strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in epidemiology established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge i hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style,positive
if you liked whyte s previous sophomoric efforts you ll love this in addition to being the same dumb hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler in no real way does the story get advanced arthur begins as a baby and ends as a small boy there are adventures but nothing important happens as usual in whyte s books the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters with all the \( totally ahistorical \) democratic rhetoric merlin s brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot anyone who would read this i guess has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn t object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence caricatures who never grow or change and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship so go for it but please if you want something exciting that will also make you think look at the really good arthurian efforts out there gillian brandshaw a a attanasio or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few,negative
i am a gigantic james brown fan i have 100 albums 130 singles i ve met him 5 times seen him live over 100 times since 1971 had lunch with him in nyc and i am the paul in the jb section of gerri hirshey s nice history of soul music nowhere to run but if this book was written by james brown or if he even had much to tell the writer i ll eat my refrigerator it is so full of errors that it is laughable one of the most glaring errors was when mr brown supposedly said say it loud was where funk started or something to that effect that is so ridiculous james brown would never say such a thing any student of funk knows that cold sweat was the quintessentional funk piece and it is not even mentioned in the book the style of mr brown s sentences that are attributed to him sound nothing like him i have no idea why this was put out the other autobiography written over a decade ago was more relevent and much better written the godfather of soul by jb and bruce tucker someone \( alan leeds \) needs to write a 600 page comprehensive biography of mr brown with much more detail,negative

the cover of this book compares it to the kite runner so it caught my attention i honestly could not stop reading as yasmina khadra does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters he weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people s humanity my only nit is the ending was a bit predictable that said it was still a very good ending that rings true spoiler if you wonder why she didn t come back consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street which led to them being stopped which ultimately resulted in her husband s death i honestly can t wait to read more by yasmina khadra,positive

introducing postmodernism is a good source to gather names of philosophers architects artists anthropologists linguists and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm the problem and it is a big one is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines sure if you only have half an hour to read up on pm you can whip through this book and go on with your life but if you re wanting to really absorb the phenomenon and perhaps go on to read more this book is not the place to start check out david harvey s condition of postmodernism this will rip the top of your head clean off it s much more weighty \( in every sense of the word \) but your understanding of pm will vastly improve and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the genre,negative
eugene o neill s play long day s journey into night is a pulitzer award winning autobiographical play about his family i must admit that though eugene o neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater i did not enjoy reading this play the tyrone family s insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o neill offered no conclusion the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends no happy ending no hope for the future just despair long day s journey into night is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without however after learning more about eugene o neill s background and the extent to which the play is based on his life i began to have a greater appreciation for this play o neill did lead a very hard life therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o neill s talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner while o neill s depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending it was appropriate for the play as eugene s own family never got a happy ending i did like the clever way o neill showed the tyrone family s desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal loving family the audience soon however gets the suspicion that something isn t quite right and that the family is tense slowly the family s skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth although i still believe long day s journey into night to be thoroughly disheartening to read the reader s emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o neill s exceptional writing,negative

seventeen year old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things dancing dressing and reading sensational novels but doing these things won t get you a husband or acquaint you with other young ladies such as yourself so upon request from a neighbor catherine is invited to spend some time in bath a fashionable town where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature who are not related to her and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious yet conniving family and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney along with his charming sister eleanor and whisked off to their ancestral home known only as northanger abbey there catherine s choice of reading material mysteries and ghost stories that is comes back to haunt her for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night such as creaking and frightening winds that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors and a curious history only heightens young catherine s suspicions and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey and the tilney family in general jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore and decided to purchase it i will admit that hands down this has become one of my favorite austen books catherine is an enchanting character whose innocence and naivete make her charming from beginning to end while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers catherine s interactions with isabella thorpe and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters while the charming henry tilney like mr darcy makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman and our young heroine a wonderful satirical piece of fiction that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape,positive

i was expecting this book to be a great story but very disappointed i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is the book is insipid and dull has no flow no story or no plot let me present an example i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan for example sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way if talk is getting cheaper why did mci worldcom pay 115 billion to buy sprint the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world can regulators handle the complex new order it has a clear logical axis and has a force to attract readers into it but jeter describes it like this the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit it always presents off center trivial detail which makes a reader bored 70 of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact like the merger of company a b raised the stock to x etc there is no insight here but unfortunately unlike enron scandal there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost,negative
it doesn t sound like the people you list as reasons not to read this book actually read this book there is a big difference in my opinion of putting positive affirmations in your mind versus a witch doctor and quite honestly it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in conjuction with medical care does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care because you will most definitely be healed no where so in my opinion one has to have a sound mind and not view the book as a cure all for all the ills in life but rather a positive way to enhance your life it is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care when you have a terminal illness or any other illness for that matter but according to what i gather from the book you can use positive affirmations and believe that you are getting well to help keep yourself in a positive state rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well studies aside from this book have proven that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook have done wonders for recovering patients along with their medical care your review did not address any of those people that read this book because the two examples of people you list it is apparent they didn t read the book either \( not sure what compelled you to post here \) therefore you are not qualified in my opinion to critique this book as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist did they prescribe drinking snakes blood too anyway this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick and those that do probably won t be addressing their medical problem can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis i imagine it can \( studies prove it can \) in addition to proper medical treatment anyway you might want to actually read the book instead of making comments of what happened to so and so who didn t even read it or apply it including yourself,positive
theodore b taylor the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004 but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester even though the text of this book originally appeared in the new yorker in 1973 taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation mcphee has a very understated style \( just the facts ma am \) but this book is still the most frightening i ve ever read i can t decide whether i would want him to write a sequel because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973 just ask yourself the following questions is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973 yes do more nations have nuclear capability yes can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart yes are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973 yes do some people hate america even more than they did in 1973 decide this one for yourself john mcphee staff writer for the new yorker and pulitzer prize winning author of twenty seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine has written a nuclear explosion of a book in the curve of binding energy it s one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written essentially it s a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand along with a chunk of rather easily stolen u 235 or plutonium theodore b taylor himself the creator of smaller more efficient nuclear bombs tells us where to steal the plutonium how to assemble a bomb even gives hints on where to plant it one of the eeriest parts of this book has taylor and mcphee exploring the now vanished towers of the world trade center trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage the curve of binding energy is a must read for every man jack and paper pusher in the department of homeland security not to mention both houses of congress i imagine the first reaction of many congresspersons would be to ban this book but it s way too late for that my friend,positive

from the cover and a quick glances at some of the colorful photo filled chapters this book seem promising at first but the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover has taken its toll this book provides marginal advice on how to potentially make a profit from the wonderful world of digital photography however it fails to give any real world working model on how this can be accomplished most of the marginally useful advices and sales model i e pricing structure on stock photos are based on the author s own personal preference and experience rather than taking into account the wide breadth of pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography this is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict table of content perspective of the available methods and channels of distribution to target e g card stock stock photo art fairs etc most of topics cover seem to be more theoretical than actual real world hands down information and the author seems to expend more time energy and care in expressing his disdain \( with a condescending overtone might i add \) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and quick his favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs includes but certainly are not limited to prima donnas pretentious and pretend aficionado heller may be a self aggrandizing professional photographer but anyone with such high caliber should be more helpful than pompous or supercilious remember heller you were an amateur at one point too further more heller likes to take a seemingly interesting idea get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn t pursue it because the odds are just too high against you bottomline if you are serious about licensing your photographs for use then this book does not really cover the core foundations that you need to get your feet wet on the otherhand if you want to take a look at what you can do to potentially make a profit from your hobby then this book basically gives you an general idea i d give this book a 1 star for the lack of usable information and the author s cockiness but it does contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a 2 star rating,negative

i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were heisenberg s uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned hawking made it seem like common sense hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times \( and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points just in case you missed them \) but all in all this was a quite readable account of what s presently known about cosmology i use the term presently guardedly as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter \( it exists \) but from now on when there are new findings in physics i want hawking to explain them to me because i feel like then i might understand them that s why you should read this book the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical this was still a hard read and i feel like i grasped maybe 80 of it for you to decide but for a former engineering student this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics,positive

i tend to like just about anything that brubaker writes while i m not as excited about his marvel work as most others are i have enjoyed his runs on captain america and daredevil his work outside of marvel has been great sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years in general brubaker had not written anything that i genuinely disliked then came deadly genesis in short this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results to what end another summers brother who is completely disinteresting another story in which professor x acts like a jerk a dead x men \( for absolutely no good reason \) and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years i want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate unfortunately this is the second instance in which brubaker has went back and altered marvel history from long ago in captain america he made it so that bucky never really died in world war ii this initially rubbed me the wrong way but the story itself was done well and the surrounding plots were good so i begrudgingly went along for the ride i was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book his attempt to revise history doesn t work nearly as well here the key difference is that bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust he hadn t been written into any stories during all that time so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him in deadly genesis brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago in order for them to work the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward it just doesn t work to make matters worse none of the characters motivation for anything makes any sense at all characters are keeping secrets and other characters are upset with that and through the whole you never understand why it s as if brubaker had an end goal in mind and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point a to point b even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn t make complete sense that aside another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as captain america they overall plot doesn t make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment the interior art is nice though not great unfortunately the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration,negative
a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball nuts who grew up in new york we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny wonder five who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 \( it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled \) this book is a fictional addendum to rosen s non fiction treatment of the original basketball scandals as he outlines in his npr interview unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors broadway and 43rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan madison square garden has been on 23rd street and is now above penn station in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college and they undermine the author s credibility and care in writing since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence the game of who is this really is inescapable hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers and a couple are in the hall of fame this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy \( holy cross 49 \) dick mcguire \( st johns 48 \) bobby wanzer \( seton hall 46 \) and frank mcguire the legendary coach at st john s north carolina and south carolina,negative

peter balakian s book black dog of fate tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them in essence it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling i wish the author had done a bit more in depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non armenians for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative unengaged and unconvincing pity since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football the yankees modern poetry and exposing turkish attempts to buy \( among others \) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism practiced by the modern turkish state and its organs it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels the i and we and us occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice but is it realy since in order to make this legitimate the writer must distance himself at least initially from all this old world exotica and like the reader question their validity or relevance in present day north american society what are all these old world old fashioned ghosts and traditions is the first cry of writer and reader alike only ofcourse to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein this culture and this lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic memory free self redefining comfort seeking and buying mores in the balakian tale one encounters suburbia instead of substance worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism the abstract and unemotional or else towards medicine respectability and detachment young balakian observes but never understands the grandmother for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find their crime is self denial and a march to the tune of america s mixmaster piper be unlike your past and your future will be brighter seems to be what america promises at the very least the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying as if to serve sweet irony full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday peter is lost alright but as the book sadly shows he remains lost paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make \( for that read vahakn dadrian s the history of the armenian genocide berghahn books 1995 \) episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear say and as mere isolated incidents leading to more harm than good \( for if better evidence existed the arguement goes why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare \) for the story to have worked for the story to have really worked as i would have liked it to balakian s life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it and his relationship with his wife who like him is not leading a strongly armenian existence would have had to have changed solidifying his roots celebrating his new found identity and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which alas never appear on the pages of this book how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness except that the transition has not occured the ship of armenianness sails by balakian he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it but not resolved enough to climb aboard that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future read mark arax s book in my father s name \( simon schuster 1996 \) where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax one can only hope that balakian s partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer \( not withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers \) this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second i speak here of passage to ararat by michael arlen \( hungry mind republication 1996 \) where a disinterested soit disant armenian goes to armenia in the 70 s and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people s woes and dreams too little too late and always detached is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold however i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories will be written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home,positive
grudem seems to have a very distorted and confused vision of christ we can only hope that evangelical become more like christ jesus was the first real liberal and the most radical of liberals if jesus of nazareth was anything he was an extraordinary friend of the down trodden definitely a liberal whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the ultra conservative religious and political leaders of his day that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in jesus own words on this web site those who actually know what the bible says about the life and teaching of jesus recognize that far from being like jesus of nazareth today s religious right are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the day they had him nailed to a cross although these people claim to represent jesus christ they rarely quote his teaching or follow his example what they do instead is use his name \( in vain \) to promote their ideas ideas which jesus himself did not teach and might well have opposed,negative
this book is a romance and i liked it my only excuse is it s a classic romance i loved it in fact it s on my top ten favorite books list it wasn t gross it wasn t weird it wasn t annoyingly romantic i loved it \( i might say that a few more times \) i loved elizabeth jane mr bennet s relations with mrs bennet mr darcy mr bingly mr collins \( my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie \) i can t even find words to describe how much i loved this book i read it this summer and i m still at a loss for words all i can say is i ll definitely be picking up more classics and my book of jane austen s works will soon be veeeery well worn,positive

one of the nicest things someone did for me when i lost my husband to leukemia was to send me this book the selections are sympathetic and inspiring also they re short at a time when the mourner really can t concentrate on long selections this book has helped me through the most difficult time of my life,positive

alexander pope was not of the romantic period and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a gre subject test this alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions asks for identification of the most obscure passages and frequently explains why b was the right answer and why a c and d were wrong but leaves that status of e wholly to the realm of mystery the practice test sent out with the gre registration is different in scope clarity and difficulty i actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration don t buy this book don t even steal it spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it,negative
i read this years after i d read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it wasn t as rewarding as the first two books were maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style i dunno i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff j d salinger s the man,positive
i bought this book this weekend as we re doing the pre five in a row w our preschooler and i don t much like it i ve got a mother w borderline personality disorder and who doesn t observe personal boundaries of other s what so ever \( if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and friends ugh \) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her stalker mom mentality in the end i think if a person is from a semi normal household w proper respect for a child s boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too smoothering even ones w o personality disorders and this book doesn t send a message about love as much as i own you i like mama do you love me better for explaining to a child a parent s unconditional love good night moon by margaret wise brown however is by far my children s all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he s from a fairly normal family take it w a grain of salt,negative
i didn t know why i chose to read this book anyway it was disappointing really the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it s making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow but taylor s self conflict was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father s death well then it s really his fault he was a coward if you don t believe me go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it s towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book and what did i find nothing oh what a waste it s like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it didn t really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like if it hadn t been for my hrr \( home reading report \) i wouldn t have finished reading this at all i guess i m saying this because i m not into this genre love stories are fine but this one nah,negative
although the photographs are dated the material is classic this book is a must for anyone who is involved with design or review of open spaces it shows how people use open space and identifies the common elements of successful spaces while the elements all seem logical the book shows how we often fly in the face of logic when using these spaces the book focuses primarily on plazas and small parks in new york city but includes a section for smaller cities with low rise buildings the information can also be applied to parks in any size town this book is a facinating case study in social ecology,positive
sedgwick s character is a perverted boring loser worst book i ve ever read well almost read talentless end of story,negative
ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality to her there is no middle ground i am an educated well travelled adult who while born in the united states spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded to be called a communist a traitor and an enemy of america just because i don t buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on i have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it s evil until i read this one be afraid be very afraid of these people,negative
i wanted to like this book but i had to give up in the end if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough the execution of detail isn t kosinski can t write he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important whereas the reader is always expected to discover depth in simplicity nothing to be recommended for,negative
this breviary is disappointing to traditional catholics novus ordo catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a traditional orthodox catholic who favors the roman rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations this is the same ole same ole vatican ii stuff,negative
