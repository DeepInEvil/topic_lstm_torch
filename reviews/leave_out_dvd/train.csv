i have had this unit for 8 months and haven t had any problems it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand and i have very small hands some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin,positive
the top doesn t seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering also the bottle being so narrow it s hard to clean,negative
we bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name we have been using it for about 4 months now it cooks good rice however the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said we ve got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason and the rice was in keep warm mode at all times in addition if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the keep warm mode for a day the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy so you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout i haven t tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice if i were to decide all over again i would stay away from this rice cooker i thought i ve bought a top notched product now i regret that i spent this much on a rice cooker,negative
i bought one of these for my apartment and it s quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it s a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show with that in mind it s a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor \( particularly for indoor environments \) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty s respiratory system,positive
i already had a cake lifter when i visited my daughter and her husband at christmas they were lifting a coffee cake out of the oven using two small spatulas i knew how much easier it would have been with the cake lifter so i wanted to get one for them googled spatulas and was amazed at how many there were finally found one just like mine and ordered two of them one for each daughter i have given one hers and she was delighted will give the other one hers when i visit in march i use mine often and am glad to have it don t believe enough people know there is such an item on the market too bad it isn t sold more widely,positive
i have these sheets on my bed right now they are very comfortable and soft after just one washing the price was great and the striping addds style to otherwise bland white sheets,positive
i have this bowl and the larger one they are perfect bowls for mixing the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put i was them in the dishwasher without any problems,positive
this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart which at best made mediocre toast and had that icky plastic worn out look this toaster is metal sturdy and has a great retro look in today s colors mine is red i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen amazon service has been great and with the 25 off i got some great buys,positive
this product does not work the dial just moves randomly please tell me who to contact for a refund,negative
my husband goes to bed much later than i do until i got this gadget i had to go to sleep with a bedroom light on and he would leave a low light on in the living room in order to see his way to the bedroom i have installed 3 of these units one in the living room one in the hall and one in the bedroom they light up sequentially as he comes to be,positive
a good basic place to hang a half dozen jackets or hats its a little wobbly when loaded but not too bad easy to assemble and looks ok a good overall buy,positive
the unit has nice large digits but the wireless sensors don t work consistantly the system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down we have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re established,negative
i agree with a previous review coating does not hold up comes off if bumped to hard has been used gently and the metal is already showing one thing i would like to know is what is the highest temp this coating will tolerate,negative
it s fiesta ware what s not to love couldn t find this one anywhere else,positive
my cats love this they will play with it by themselves or with each other it is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat but he still loves to play on it,positive
love it rechargeable seems to last better than battery operated ones the design has improved too i have had two of them i love how you can dismantle this one so it won t break if packed away makes good froth too,positive
i was surprised by the quick delivery i opened the box to check the bowls everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present,positive
this is a great heater it warms up the room very quickly it has a nice feature of oscillating it also works as a fan the thermometer is good,positive
everything about our miele \( red velvet \) vacuumn cleaner is top notch including the bags the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner this is just a small detail but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company s products,positive
giving 2 stars on the suction alone hepa filter doesn t self clean turn after one use a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you don t pay very close attention to aligning it just right i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it s heavy and dirt just falls out a lot of dirt when emptying the dirt box i m returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience,negative
love this product excellent cheese cutter three choices of thickness highly recommended,positive
the price went down from 6 95 to 3 95 it s very nice looking you will be pleased with it approximately 13 and a half inch square i was expecting a black cloth loop to hang it from but the loop turned out to be the sewn in label that s okay,positive
the packaging hadn t been so pathetic the tiny pieces of styrofoam that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant the cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame and one of the pipes was broken and leaking plus there was no crisper drawer included i won t be buying a replacement from sanyo,negative
these are so adorable the patterns are too cute and they can be mixed and matched just like boring cups and saucers they even make me happy when i see them in the cabinet they are a great shape and size i am inspired to upgrade my espresso machine because these only deserve the best,positive
our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs,positive
i ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time i was sorely disappointed there is no measuring cup so all water amounts must be estimated \( the unit has three lines to help but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs \) there is no buzzer when the unit is finished so unless you babysit it everything ends up overcooking this is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled,negative
this is truly a great waffle maker to have if you have kids they love to eat them and make their own,positive
these glasses are very cheap i sent everyone of them back when i recived them 2 were broken they are very thin,negative
i bought this as my second fryer the third time i used this fryer the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid wouldn t close properly and that s the end of it prior to buying this fryer i had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine,negative
we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand \( they are made like hotel china essentially homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line \) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave they are both great never been disappointed with fiestaware,positive
i returned the honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed the 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box the first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the high speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings the second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position the fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate the 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier the design defects are so major that the person \( s \) that designed and approved the design of the 6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired the first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink because of this i must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still cannot completely fill the water container to the top the screw on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright the next design defect is that one cannot at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container one can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night the last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just drop into place on the base one must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position angle of the water container to get it to seat properly this is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time i bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service i also selected the 6011i humidifier because of its many desirable features however the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i humidifier i believe that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier thus i returned the 6011i humidifier,negative
first one came cracked second one came chipped gave up,negative
works great i purchase 3 one for my husband and 2 more for my children good design however it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry an ipod and a gameboy the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time,positive
we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand that after 2 years was no longer bouncing back into shape this serta topper is just fine as comfortable as our last one my big complaint is that someone at serta \( though serta isn t the actual manufacturer \) needs to measure a queen sized bed because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides if you place the topper in the included protective cover it s several inches short on all 4 sides i know 1 inch sounds minor but if you re a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed the topper doesn t protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress as far as toppers in general we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed you don t feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper \( though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more \) definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford and the thickest you can afford,positive
2 years ago i purchased these dishes i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star until 6 months ago all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half \( these dishes are microwave safe and no children \) all have broken in the same place 2 broke when picking up 4 have broken while microwaving yet all my cups bowls salad square plates are still in perfect condition but without my dinner plates my set \( s \) are useless,negative
these are nice to keep a martini cold but they re a bit large,positive
i have owned a roomba for several years and have been very pleased with its performance so i was very excited to purchase the scooba however it has been the worst purchase that i ever made the first one that i received would quit working every time it bumped into furniture or the wall irobt did send a replacement but it only works about half of the time the other half of the time it does not vacuum up the dirty water so it leaves the floor dirtier than before i cleaned it i have contacted irobot for help but none of their suggestions have worked honestly i would throw it in the trash if it did not cost so much,negative
received this as a gift and i must say i m very disappointed at its highest setting it takes forever to toast the other issue is that if you buy any bread with non standard width \( like home made gourmet breads \) it won t fit into the toaster,negative
i was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer i have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were i bought them because i liked the color and the red is a very pretty bright color i would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets or dry them on low heat the material of the sheets is fairly thin so i am not sure how long they will last,negative
now i don t know whether you are a die hard hello kitty fan or not but you gotta have this the numerous different settings the awesome design and the fact that it s hello kitty makes it worth it s weight in gold i had been looking for one of these cheap and i ended up getting one for the holidays so that worked well these toasters are cheap as they come online here so grab em and go good luck if ya get one \( the hello kitty waffle maker and juicer rock too,positive
i understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle you may think air only gets in when you pour oil out but that s not true any time the temperature rises the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout when the temperature drops air enters the spout this is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen if you don t use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid if you use cheap olive oil \( and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil even the extra virgin \) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils but it will still happen i would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again \( i learned this lesson the hard way \) a better option though less elegant is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it,negative
this coffeemaker s design is flawed but my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best i ve received from any company in years they sent their new thermal carafe model which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of give them a chance to make it right customer service is part of the equation with any purchase and mr coffee sunbeam has impressed me on that score,negative
my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly it sucks great is easy to clean and light weight the price is fantastic,positive
i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy i would say this table is worth 20 and no more,negative
i purchased this product in november 2003 and still have not had it installed the customer service is horrible i had questions and had a very difficult time finding a service company who knew anything about this haier machine i called customer service over five times and had to have corporate refer me to a company in indiana nobody i knew has had a combo and it has been frustrating dealing with the company i also did not know i could not return this product i honestly regret getting this machine it is pricey and not worth it i was looking forward to the space saving option but i rather have no machine than face the hassles and headaches i read a few negative reviews and do not look forward to the troubles ahead,negative
i was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did i find a nice one with the arched back speaker portion of the stereo it provides a surround sound like atmosphere also it has quite a loud capacity for volume i mean if you wanted to you could really get it crankin anyway it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod the sound clarity is very crisp and clear the only tiny flaw i could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs a soft high pitched whine is sometimes incurred however once the song begins to play this whine disapears immediately i would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price,positive
i usually like oxo products but this one is a real loser not only does it not give accurate readings \( which in itself should deem it useless being that it is a thermometer after all \) but there are other features that further enhance its horrible design first of all the handy \( so they claim \) spin dial that allows you to set the temperature that you want to reach is so flimsy that the slightest movement of the thermometer throws the dial off useless secondly after only one handwashing water seeped under the dial face which is impossible to get out the water then turns to steam which fogs up the display so you can t even read its inaccurate readings 2 weeks later there is still steam under the dial useless again and to pour salt on my already stinging wound i had emailed oxo to inquire about how to return this item and get a refund weeks ago but they have yet to respond to me even though on the package it states that satisfaction is 100 percent guaranteed well i am not a satisfied customer and if my second attempt to reach them proves fruitless once again then i doubt i will ever purchase another oxo product again no matter how good they are it pains me to even give this product one star as a product that s utterly useless deserves no star at all oxo should be ashamed of themselves thanks for allowing me to vent my 2 cents,negative
so far this product is working fine has plenty of power heats food in a flash very good quality for the price i paid for i,positive
while one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles i couldn t get it to work at all i tried it on two different shapes of bottles but to no avail the problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper doesn t slide when it s on the bottle when off the bottle the mechanism works fine it appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general at least that was my experience i found a good 3 00 stopper at sur la table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle it doesn t have the fancy pour spout but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne,negative
had somewhat higher expectations given that this was a lennox got the shaker home tried it out it leaks no matter how hard you hold the darn thing together it leaks i am a materials engineer so i gave the product a more than cursory examination very very poor quality also made in china \( if that has anything to do with quality hint hint wink wink \) do not buy,negative
you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they re doing do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok,negative
the thermometer of this heater is completely messed up it does not measure the room temperature but the temperature of the air that has just been heated up in other words if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so \( according to the thermometer reading \) in less 2 minutes and stop if you do not use this functionality but instead let the heater run for some time \( 5 10 minutes \) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees the thermometer is probably in the wrong location did honeywell do any kind of testing before putting this model on the market,negative
well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic,positive
my husband travels to uk frequently and it s hard to find a good cup of coffee there we ve looked everywhere for a portable coffee press that would work in a hotel room in conjunction with a hot water pot this fills the need completely,positive
the frother works well as others have said unfortunately it broke very easily when i dropped it into the sink while cleaning i ve only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info this device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events,negative
i ve been through four of these expensive units they work great on my great pyrenees dog at least they work for awhile then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with and then i send it back for repair once i got back a unit that worked again for awhile then i got back a unit that never worked again i stopped sending in my broken units after that so in desperation and impending poverty i switched to a shock collar it was either that or what my breeder calls a blue juice special it also worked and yes i tried it on myself and decided that it wasn t cruel at all but the punchline is this the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar at least they were cheaper so i didn t lose as much money,negative
i looove this mug its such a beautiful shade of red very nice looking also these mugs are huge one of mine already has a chip on it but i ll leave that to certain people in my house being very clumsy,positive
sigh was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces i should have heeded the previous reviewer s warning doh oh well live and learn live and learn refund please,negative
worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out guess you get what you pay for,negative
this french press made a delicious cup of coffee the problem is that it is advertised as a 3 cup coffeemaker i returned it and will get a larger size,negative
i received my butter dish in a very timely fashion very well packaged too the product is wonderful it s being used on a daily basis i am extremely happy with the product the shipper,positive
i ve had my juicer now for about 3 years and i haven t had any problems with it in fact after having had several juicers this one is my favorite in the price range i also don t understand the customer service problems one of the rubber feet on the bottom split and i called customer service a week later i had four new ones in the mail pros much quieter than most juicers of its type as well i did a side by side comparison with my buddie s juiceman juicer and my yield was approximately 30 greater cons as with any other similar juicer cleaning it gets old that s probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times day,positive
rapid efficient sturdy and easy to clean must to attached to the edge of a counter and the right edge was hard to find i hand pitted cherries for 90 minutes and completed the same number in 15 minutes with the cherry pitter,positive
i just received this wine tower the other day it looks as wonderful in my home as it does in the picture it s perfect for our needs and takes up so little space the only complaint i have and why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 it was a pain for my husband to put together also it came with 2 bottom shelves instead of one bottom and one top he had to improvise until i can get this corrected with the manufacturer \( fortunately it s not noticeable \) in spite of this i recommend this wine tower for anyone wanting an expensive looking wine tower that is so space efficient at this price i ve already gotten compliments on it from friends,positive
i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail,negative
zero best describes how well amazon supports what they sell great deal on this toaster absolutely and it does a nice job on toast but after using the left side twice it stopped locking down so now we have a 2 slice toaster amazon just takes your money and runs giving the standard answer that you have to take it up with krups krups to their credit at least will look at the problem and repair or replace it if they determine it is a warranty covered problem unfortunately you ll have to box the item up and ship it to one of about krups service centers around the country to see if they fix it or not at your cost shipping cost more than the toaster did save yourself the aggravation go buy your toaster at walmart bed bath beyond or someplace that will at least swap it out for you without all this hassle,negative
i bought this because it was on sale and i wanted to try it now i want to kick myself for not getting it sooner this is a gaget worth having my husband even loves it it makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze it gets plenty of use and it still going strong it is very user friendly and so easy to empty,positive
i bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before christmas 2006 it seemed like a perfect if unnecessary stocking stuffer for my wife since we re both wine enthusiasts i never really felt these gimmick aerators did much that a solid 1 2 hour decanting couldn t do boy was i wrong the device itself is attractive compact and solidly built it appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass funnel with a rubber grip there are two small channels in the center of the funnel which look like cracks in the plastic \( i ve read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable \) wine is poured through the top of the funnel and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel the aerator is easily held and i ve never had a problem with spills now on to the effect of the vinturi i ve been using the vinturi for 5 months now on a variety of wines from a bottle of two buck chuck to a nice 98 vietti barolo to a bottle of 97 phelps insignia in every circumstance with every wine i ve noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the vinturi as opposed to tasted directly from bottle the flavours are more blended the finish is less acidic and frankly it has made most of the wines i drink a more pleasurable experience from sniff to swallow i ve conducted several blind tastings with friends and we all agree this thing works if you re a serious wine drinker or shopping for a wine drinker in your life give this product a try at 40 it s about the price of a decent california cabernet and will yield results for decades to come i plan on picking up a few dozen this christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients,positive
i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go what a disappointment they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments trust me if you have to choose between the two don t spend your money on on cs2 however it may appeal to the \( human \) avid bird watcher \( \),negative
i bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don t work well the manual is not thorough but it does tell you after you bought the product that there is a one second delay unless you buy an ac adapter i just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn t about to buy an ac adapter to see if that fixed it it cut off my mom s voice and i rarely heard her message the units also have annoying beeps that can t be turned off no real volume control either a very overpriced and poorly designed unit also the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them the sound is clear if it doesn t cut you off but the units are far from user friendly,negative
i bought this item about 6 months ago after 2 months the handle fell off on phoning the company they said plastic parts were only guaranteed for 1 month hence they would not replace it after another 2 months the unit stopped working altogether i then got in touch with the company and managed to speak to a very rude customer service representative who said i would have to send it to the company and pay for shipping and handling myself yet it says in the handbook that the company would pay for the shipping i am truely disappointed with the lack of customer care and the appliance i do believe i have a faulty appliance but the compnay is not at all bothered to keep its customers happy i do not reccomend that anyone buy this item save your money and all the hastle,negative
i bought this particular lever corkscrew because i read a very favorable review in consumer reports it is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears the guide and the frame after about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use i actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point end of story,negative
i need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price plus 6 napkins both packets arrived dirty with many hanging threads and i threw them straight into the washer they are 55 cotton and 45 polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free i am very happy with these basic table linens i like the price too made in pakista,positive

the only good thing which occurred when i bought this item from amazon was it arrived with in two days i was quite disappointed when i opened the package only to find it was a typical pop up hamper i could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run i ended up paying more for it i wanted to buy a pop up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed this hamper lacks a lid so i reccomend if you re looking for the same thing not to buy it if i had known it lacked a lid i would not have purchased the hamper it s partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product i gave it two stars because it s still functional and sturdy,negative
i owned this dispenser for close to a year and love it the cereal is always fresh and accessible and i do not have to keep the boxes or reach out to grab few nuts for a quick snack great design,positive
believe me i dearly wanted this pan to work out it costs well over 100 however no matter what i did everything i cooked in this pan stuck i tried using it without greasing it greasing it with oil spraying pam on it putting ghee butter in it etc the following things all stuck pancakes eggs hamburgers and chicken in fact every thing i tried stuck also the shape was strange as most of the surface area was off the heating surface also they have this 1 label on the bottom that was hard to get off i finally did but once i cooked something when i turned the pan over there was a microscopic film of glue from the label that i wasn t able to get off and it had turned brown ugggh this was the worst cooking experience of my life needless to say i returned this pan,negative
sometimes it sprays when she barks most of the time it doesn t so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low it s not the battery or the fill level maybe it just depends on the dog i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine \( my children found this amusing,negative
we recently moved and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment one cat usually friendly and playful would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment the other cat usually very docile was being overly aggressive during play time with the other cat and with us after buying the comfort zone plug in we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal more friendly and playful less anxious and aggressive the only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug in vial will last 4 weeks but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3 but maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left it is hard to judge when the plug in actually ran out because the cats behavior did not change even after i unplugged the diffuser,positive
my husband and i took over a house with 2 kitchens and i wanted to decorate the smaller one in cream an black i fell in love with these but never received them they were sent to the wrong address and after the 2nd time amazon wouldn t send them again and i gave up i went ahead and gave them 5 stars cause i was at a freinds house and she had these dishes they were really heavy and the print was consistent i m so jealous,positive
the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i d say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i ve been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material,positive
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i didn t return it it would have made a nice decorative throw the color and texture are nice,negative

i ve owned this sofa for less than a year and it completely fell apart the seat of the sofa is supported by a wooden frame with a nylon webbing stretched taught and stapled over it we had 4 people of reasonable weight on the sofa \( something we ve done numerous times before \) and it collapsed out from underneath us the four parts of the seat frame are held in with small little dowels that rest on a less than one inch lip around the outside of the couch frame the sofa is designed to look nice but does not hold up well to average use for 400 a sofa should last at least a year of moderate use of people only sitting on it you re better off going to ikea or some other retailer that spends as much time in the basic structural design as they do in the appearance of the couch,negative
when this fountain is freshly cleaned the cats love it the water does stay cool but cat hair lots of that around here clogs the pump and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly it grows slime eeeeuuuw the first pump lasted about three months then the replacement lasted about a month not really worth it because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway,negative
i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i ve tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it s horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine,negative
i ve bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories and found them to be sturdy remarkably well designed and easy to use unfortunately this timer is an exception it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point clock plus timer ten number keys for input memory etc but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers it s round like a traditional wind up kitchen timer it s solid feeling and has nice non skid feet on the bottom the problem is the display it s horrible for three reasons first the numbers are small smaller than any other timer i ve seen they re about 1 4 high half or less the size of those on comparable timers second the numbers are recessed 1 8 or more beneath a clear plastic cover not on the surface it s dark in there and feels like looking down a well it desperately needs a backlight but there is none unless the light source is shining directly into the display there s a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers but that causes the third problem the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective and it s virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn t a reflection shining back into your eyes the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer the light source and myself into a position where i can read the small dark shadowed and reflective display not what i need when i m trying to cook it s just not worth it since i have several other timers with displays i don t have to strain to read i use this one as a paperweight i d have to say it works very well i just don t understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door,negative
i really like this kitchen gadget as it different actually useful and my hands smell less like garlic thus far i have only used it to chop herbs onions and garlic so i can t debunk the mush mess i would simply say don t pull the cord a lot if you re worried about it i bought about 5 and gave them all out as x mas gifts,positive

we were very skeptical one of our cats would mark certain spots \( like corners \) occassionaly but we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room it got so bad that we had to discard the rug we tried boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day but the one time we forgot to spray he would mark again we were at our wits end and decided to try feliway we bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots at first we also used the boundary but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn t see any urine markings anymore it took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work our cat even appears more calm and pleasant we make sure that we replace the container of feliway every 5 weeks or so it s well worth the money,positive

this is a nice quality lightweight comforter there is a discrepancy right up front in the product details that lists it as shipping weight 9 00 lbs which is not the case at all after arrival of two of them we were shocked when advised seller they replied after many days said we needed to read the product description \( scroll further down on item \) which was different info from what was listed above they did not update information on this item for customers on amazon site for 2 months thus the 2 stars i should have written this review earlier on the plus side it is very nice quality individual pocket stitching to keep fill in place and border piping ideal for springtime,negative

as stated before in many a review this machine is the best deal for the money paired with a real espresso grinder \( which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself \) this machine is capable of producing real espresso my father bought this for me for my birthday back in december and the machine is still in working condition my only real beef with this machine is the wand i can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher however the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off right into my milk i have taken to using the wand without either of them on but this isn t optimum for latte foam the only other thing that bothers me is that i have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead this is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing but i d rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra 300 for something in stainless steel all in all the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time i use it woohoo by zoe ros not tim,positive

ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob i am more of a coffee nut i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose and for a guy like me this machine is perfect i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4 5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret i have had the machine about 3 weeks now i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient and dont get me wrong the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had very quickly but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for be it a straight shot a cappucino or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you may not be good enough for a coffee snob but just right for a coffee nut oh and one hint i found very helpfull turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it \( the longer the better \) with your cups up on the warmer i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso,positive

have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers london broil steaks it produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use the cooking grate can only be set at two levels standing on its posts or inverted lying on the rim of the firebox the level must be chosen before you start cooking which presents a problem for some preparations the damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature emptying ash is a bit awkward as you need to remove the doors and coal grate then lift and tip the firebox which is heavy the lip catches some ash so it is difficult to completely empty be sure to set the grill on a pan as grease will leak through and collect around the legs,positive

i bought this espresso coffee maker to use with warm milk it is great if you like to make lattes or just plain expressos it brews fast less than two minutes it makes a great cuban coffee but make sure you use the coffee like pilon or bustelo that comes in pressed packets not the cans i do not use italian roast because i do not think it would give me the same flavor for my lattes,positive

i do most of the vacuuming my wife s only request when i went looking for a new model was that it use a bag she absolutely hates the bagless models and doesn t want to see what we re pulling up we have two dogs \( an akita and a golden retriever \) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day so after searching i find this model i researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me i take the plunge and order it from amazon now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and i was shocked when it arrived in 4 the big thing i like about this unit is that the bags it uses \( although a little hard to find \) have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt the unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well and boy does it clean our rugs look fantastic one complaint i have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off another would be that you cannot turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position i know its a safety feature i just don t like it the pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades the little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas overall i would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from amazon was so positive that i ve purchased other items and make it my first place to look now,positive

i m a student in college and when my first hamper ripped i decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper my roommate rarely does his laundry so he has huge loads but his hamper manages to carry it all i saw the whitney design hamper online which looked nearly identical to my roommate s hamper so i bought it when the hamper arrived i put my clothes in it and prepared to do laundry the shoulder strap ripped right off i didn t even fill up the hamper all the way as is shown in the picture amazon sent me a replacement but now i am afraid of using the shoulder strap again and i have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires this hamper may be able to function but not well and for a college student this is definitely not sturdy enough,negative
a friend of ours bought this for us he owns several coffee shops and we were excited to have great coffee at home out of the box i needed to tinker with it for a while and had to refer to online chat rooms to figure out how to get it to work correctly the problem was that the coffee didn t stay perculating long enough in the top and then it shot down into the carafe i called bodum of north america and their customer service person was a surley they offered no help at all and had no idea what i was talking about which unless they totally disregard internet reviews was a lie several people wrote in online articles to cut down the tube that goes in to the carafe by small dimension i didn t do that but i learned that if you don t push the top down all the way it will work okay after i got it working okay it did make really good and hot coffee then the poorly designed flip top broke and bodum has never had it back in stock \( i wonder why \) then we got really sick of trying \( in vane \) to clean the inside of the carafe finally the annoyance of the thing as a whole overrode the quality of the coffee my advice is if you want really great coffee go to your local cafe for day to day coffee at home don t buy this it looks cool and does make good coffee but at a big price,negative
i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought they hold an edge well and have a good balance the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives the only problem with the set is the steel hone i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife that is the only detractor from the set,positive
the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer s design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly,positive
while this is an attractive looking paper towel holder it isn t very functional at first glance it looks like it should work as implied spring loaded arm puts pressure on paper towel roll regardless of how many towels are on that roll at the time allowing you to easily rip off a single sheet with one hand unfortunately this model doesn t work that way at least not the one i received i started with a partial roll and it was obvious this wouldn t work so i put in an extra large roll of top quality \( very thick roll \) paper towels and still they don t come close to reaching the spring loaded arm this arm is no more effective at preventing a number of sheets from pulling off the roll than the old wooden one i had with no arm at all i m very disappointed before deciding on this model i had viewed some very similar models that were higher in price maybe this is a case of you get what you pay for if you are looking for a paper towel holder that looks nice and are not concerned about function it may be worth the price if you are looking for one that looks nice and can offer you an easy one sheet at a time with one hand quick pull i suggest you look for a different model this unit won t do that job,negative

when we first bought it it worked nicely and smoothly thought we do not need to buy another opener again boy were we wrong after the third use it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning reminds me of a car turning it s wheels will all smoke and noise but no results glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name,negative
i bought this item at my local target the weekend i moved into my new apartment the parts are quality chrome and the wood top is certainly appealing to the eye if only the pieces actually fit together to assemble a sturdy piece of furniture one of the shelves doesn t fit properly over the four legs and the finished product sways at the slightest touch judging by the glowing reviews on this page at best this product is a hit or miss venture there s a reason it s priced at 30 dollars buyer beware,negative

we have owned this machine for a little over two years for the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying however since then it has stopped drying such that 5 hours of drying \( yes 5 hours \) yields wet clothes this has persisted despite 4 repairs replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board which i assume is next prior to this machine we owned an equator brand washer dryer combo which was a disaster that broke after 3 years unfortunately the lg is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines \( equator asko maber and other brands \) available in the us all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115v the bosch combos available in europe but unfortunately not available in the us are 220v and thus dry more quickly this is not a machine for a family but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most when it worked it worked well however no one should invest 1300 to have it break in such a short time and no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry if you must purchase one of these machines \( for reasons of space \) buy an extended warranty,negative

this product is a poorly designed piece of crap that is destined to fail from the first day you use it a friend had purchased this item a few months back and asked me to look at it when it died recently \( i have been repairing electrical and electronic equipment for almost 30yrs \) this is a perfect example of a throw away item if more care had gone into the design and a few more dollars into producing it you might have a product that could last a few years neither was done look at how many reviews mention the item failing after only a few months and even the positive reviewers usually have only been using it for a month or so do yourself a favor and buy a commercial grade hot plate from a reputable manufacturer you will pay more but you will likely still be using it many years from now \( not too mention that the operation will be better also \) how much value is in a 20 hot plate when it is headed to the landfill a few months from now it is a shame that so many people are willing to accept low quality products these days and think it is ok if it lasted a few months \( note the reviews \) good luck,negative
i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address it worked for two days and then it stopped on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour but it only worked intermittently she didn t keep the receipt so i m writing it off as a waste of money when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense you can see when they are empty and you don t have to keep up with batteries i don t buy the argument that the hands free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands,negative
i wanted to dress up my kitchen a little and this does the trick \( makes me not dread washing the dishes an added plus \) it s a nice cherry red and i m a bit of a red junkie i gave this five stars because it s perfect for my needs if you have a large family and tons of dishes it s going to be on the small side though the red colander s a great extra as is the little sponge holder \( it has suction cups to keep it in place but mine doesn t seem to stay stuck that s a minor detail though and it could have more to do with my kitchen s tiling than the suction cups \) one thing to note if your sink s drains aren t centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat overall this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set what more could we want,positive
people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can i have tried reconnecting it many times using different pressure as i push down but to no avail at 10 dollars a night this product will get very expensive very quickly if it had worked without the leak i would have given ssscat 5 stars,negative
after reading countless poor reviews of the dolce desk and hutch i was quite skeptical about ordering it online i gave in and ordered the set from target com the desk arrived in almost perfect condition \( a few smudges in the stain \) however only half the hutch was in its box the entire drawer \( left side of hutch \) was missing the hardware was missing and the assembly instructions were missing i recommend calling your local target store to check the dolce collection s availability \( and the parts inside \) before you waste the time and gas to get there aside from the missing hutch the desk looks really great in my home office,negative
if you like fondue you ll like raclette as much or even more use your imagination don t stick with what is traditional you can use your raclette for desert pizza breakfast and much more traditionally served with steamed red potatoes this will satisfy the meat and potatoe man in the group marinade the meat with different flavors to add some spice don t forget the vegetables slice onion red peppers mushrooms romas and even pineapple it s a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot,positive

not worth the high price difficult to clean and very persnickety comes with a bunch of sensors that if not properly triggered keep it from roasting not long after i bought it i couldn t get it to start without jamming a pencil in one spot and now it doesn t work at all when it works it works fine but it doesn t always work nor does it last very long,negative
after two months a piece of the filter broke off after 3 months the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website so i could pay another 30 or so for a new carafe because glass is not included in their warranty no thanks,negative
bad quality on off switch and plastic ring broken after 1 year,negative
finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction i have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived the suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned the hepa filter means you really can t smell that you ve been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change also who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner hey if you have to own one wouldn t you prefer to have one that s easy on the eye,positive
i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i didn t return it it would have made a nice decorative throw the color and texture are nice,negative
i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i didn t hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore,negative
i really like having this it s odor free and easy to use yes you have to empty the bags and that takes time but it s worth it i have found refills at walmart petsmart and petco so they haven t been hard to find,positive

normally things i purchase have no problem this item is now being used to heat water when company comes over for tea has to be the worse item to make coffee yet always purchase the whole beans and grind the coffee myself this item just never got the coffee s true wonderful flavor perhaps because it was a refurbished item but i just think hamilton beach needs to improve this item big time,negative
this fan is incredibly powerful it can definitely move air around a room my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium i don t know if it s just mine that is that way or not and it isn t a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i ll tell ya when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse,positive

after spending 5 10 a day at starbucks my wife and i got the jura capresso for the convenience of a fully automatic machine and having fresh latte s at home in the morning we have used it for over 3 months now and like it more and more each week the espresso latte s and cappucino s are wonderful having to touch one button to have everything done at once is so easy but perhaps the best part is the self cleaning it does about once a week you clean out a tray and refill the water that s pretty much it desserts like affogato \( espresso on top of ice cream \) are a just too easy to make now downsides if you ever plan to reduce your caffeine consumption this machine is not for you my wife and i both drink more coffee now because it is so good and so convenient if you like really hot latte s the steamed milk won t get hot enough i d call it very warm or slightly hot just right for drinking but by the end it can be kind of cool warm up the glass with the hot water option before fixes the problem espresso coffee and even cappucino s come out at a perfect temperature,positive
item was defective and this was te second item receive,negative
this product is not eligible for free shipping yet it ships from the amazon warehouse along with the humidifier that is eligible for free shipping,negative
reasons 1 faulty battery cover design the battery cover comes off time i remove the timer from a metal surface 2 the protective glass is cloudy making the timer numbers hard to see 3 the alarms are not very audible 4 the magnet unglued itself within the first three days of use,negative
total rubbish wood was scratched on top corner was smashed water damage on the shelf and door was cracked it is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use the holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control to add salt in the wound the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and i had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it if you like taking chances and do still want to buy it it s probably a 50 50 chance that it will be damaged,negative
the quality of the china is very good the weight and feel of the product is substantial i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family,positive
this appliance has several good features but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast at the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown the other side barely toasted the inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side we did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread setting a timer for 1 minute pressing cancel reversing the bread and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again far too much work,negative
from the description i thought these would be a lot more sturdy they re fine for storing light weight items that you don t need to access often but i found that the plastic supports tended to break through the fabric at the corners and break in half if stressed,negative
this hamper is okay but amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it i ordered four and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse how did they arrive in four giant shipping boxes each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags it took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags i live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce and this really an insult to me and to the environment there is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper according to the packing list the shipping cost on each was 6 which means that due to supersaver amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of 5 per hamper amazon shame on you you could have shipped all four in a large envelope,negative
we have owned the breadman corner bakery for about eight months now it has made our house smell wonderful i have to say i don t use the recipes that came with it so i won t judge those for the price this is a beautiful machine the pan has a solid heft to it not like some of the other bread makers with seemingly flimsy aluminum pans we have made many types of bread in it and have even churned butter from heavy cream the best kind of bread is the one made in the pan right after making butter with a toddler and a baby it is nice not to have to run to the store everyday to buy fresh bread or rolls the only time our bread has turned out not so good is when an ingredient has been forgotten without the yeast it wasn t quiet the same but our house smelled great,positive
for 19 99 you ll not find many knife sets i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife this set includes a long slicer utility knife one large paring knife and a 5 or 6 serrated knife the knives consist of good steel comfortable grips and are well balanced they are very sharp and sturdy i couldn t find a better set for the price i was looking for a decent utility carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set i use mine as the disposable knives for this price you won t have to worry about beating up on them and they sharpen up quickly too the red color is very festive the grips feel like silicon so they work when wet and greasy and pleasantly squish when you grip hard if you are in the market for a fine high level kitchen knife these may not fit the bill but if you are looking for good quality inexpensive knives you won t find better in this price range i paid 19 99 dec 200,positive
i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets these blankets are of really cheap quality thin mesh like texture threads get loose at the ends leaving traces of fabric everywhere i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies,negative

this delonghi bar32 espresso maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that i can find that does not have aluminum its water coffee path the boiler porta filter baskets brew group and steam wand are all stainless steel \( albeit the wand has a plastic tip \) i thought the capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta filter itself is made of aluminum \( although it does have stainless basket inserts \) and is twice the price than the delonghi bar32 it is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta filter after exiting the stainless baskets although capresso implies no in their ads,positive
the lower bowl part will last forever but the water tank lasts a month outside between the sun and cold air the plastic get weak right away and the slightest touch will crack the top i have gone through 3 of them all with exactly the same results,negative
i m a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover s delight it turned out to be my biggest nightmare it takes a lot to set it up and get it started if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place boy what a mess it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy took up way to much room on my counter i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good if not better it s small easy to run and the coffee tastes great deb in new hampshir,negative
it s a very secure for children my daughter is happy with this produc,positive
this food processor is the most powerful and quietest that i have ever used i am very impressed with the material the bowl and lid are made of the ones i have been using for the last 15 years have not been comparable in the least,positive
not the best wine opener you can buy but a great deal for the occassional wine drinker much easier to operate than the traditional corkscrew and a bargain at the 9 99 i paid,positive
fiestaware rocks the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you wouldn t normally expect to go together and they usually look great,positive
i love this honey pot the design is dainty but the pot itself is really good sized a beautiful accompaniment to the matching tea set,positive
while the water tasted better this model didn t last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place,negative
i am so disappointed with this vacuum i will say it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet but don t expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye also i have a cat so i have pet fur on my carpet and i lose a lot of hair myself and this vacuum doesn t pick any of that up i can vacuum run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair it would be useful if you are just looking for something to get the dust and such out of the carpet it seems to do that very well though you are having to constantly stop and empty the vacuum shake the filter out etc because it gets clogged very fast,negative
i bought this for my cat a few months ago because he just loves playing with a laser pointer the whole concept of this toy was great but they should ve expanded their ideas a bit more for the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does i m not sure about others but most cats i know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser maybe even jump up the wall as opposed to with the bada beam that just goes in a circle reversing its direction every once in awhile my cat never avoids the laser pointer when he sees that red light he jumps right up but with the bada beam he will just sit and stare at it the whole point is so that you don t have to hold it and let the cats go crazy nope it s one thing for me to be disappointed but it s clear that my cat was more disappointed,negative
i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no brainer there s a coarse grinder for knives that are dull for most knives the fine and polishing grinder works just great if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well made knives the waring will work well i ve had good success with the waring,positive
i just got into wine a little while ago and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler but seeing as how i m anywhere near wine snob status i didn t want to spend a bunch on a set enter the riedel o glasses they were on sale great price for two glasses they arrived and i m happy with them they re sophisticated enough to be wine glasses but without the stems they re not snobby either i would have given this 5 stars but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim almost a little bubble of glass or crystal other than that they re great,positive
the product description for this is wrong there is a somewhat hidden zipper but for some inexplicable reason the lining is sewn into the cover so you can t separate the two,negative
the pots and pans were delivered very quickly to my residence the items were well packaged since we just moved into our apartment we began using them the pots and pans had sturdy construction and was relatively easy to clean the only drawback would be the lid handles those became very hot to the touch and you would need a hand towel or an oven mitt to handle it \( on a side note the lid handles are clear glass so that is definitely a plus \) overall i am quite satisfied with the purchase they were under 100 00 for the set so we are happy with it although i did not hear of the pinzon brand before i was surprised with the quality i even purchased a oven roaster w rack from pinzon as well,positive
i just started collecting fiesta ware and this yellow covered butter dish is the perfect color for a butter dish looks great on my table \( along with my red salt and papper shakers,positive
we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky our daughter now has it and is happy with it we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump it s a little too fast for what i want most of the time another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter,positive
i bought this kettle in february 2006 i liked everything about it until its automatic on off switch died recently only two months after the purchase now the kettle won t turn on it wasn t abused in any way and these kettles usually last for years and years the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique has anyone else had one with a short lived switch or was i unlucky,negative
in my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems my main beef is it s too hard to clean a few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up it has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank soaking in vinegar doesn t do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled the \( phosporic acid based \) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing and there s the hitch you can t reach parts of the element not even with a toothbrush why they couldn t center it just a little further away from the edge of the wall is beyond my comprehension i spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart trying various methods of cleaning than with it running i wouldn t buy it again,negative
using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day our family is hard on blenders after more than a year of daily experience with the waring pro \( both mbb pbb models \) i cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making here s why both glass stainless jug models use the same blade assembly this blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit it fails often and must be rebuilt or replaced parts are easily purchased if you re handy and have the correct tools details the assembly screws together and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart but this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit that it bends the metal washer below the blade the assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn the waring pro is all the blender than many people will need but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies,negative
i took water temperatures at high low and keepwarm i am at 5200 ft altitude so water boils at about 195 all temps reached 203 and the water was in a rapid boil i have a small rival i picked up for 12 and it works great low 190 high 199 and warm 160,negative

my roommate and i use this toaster daily and i ve never had problems with it the material is light but very sturdy i actually dropped it down my stairs when i moved and it still looks and works great i love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal i plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but i suspect that won t happen for quite a while,positive
ok so i thought i was crazy not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot people were making fun of me how can you burn anything in a crockpot now i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot now i know that they are not supposed to be like this do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours i am trashing mine today,negative
i know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside i took out the battery and found water in the compartment i give it as many as two stars because until the water got in it did work as advertised and seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing i m wondering if i just had a bad o ring now i m off to find a better thermometer,negative
i ve owned a littermaid mega for about 5 years and i really wish i had been able to buy this stand sooner we have two cats and we re terribly lazy we ve had this stand for a few months and it works as described it has drastically reduced the smell and the need to clean the box we love this stand and it has made life a lot more bearable when it comes to the litter box our old littermaid just died on us and we went to replace it with a new littermaid elite but the stand isn t large enough the newer elite model is much longer than this stand and it will hang off the back and over the sides we love that stand more than we want the newer littermaid elite and we are getting a great deal on the old style of the littermaid mega from amazon i would just be aware before buying this that it only fits the old style of littermaids that being said if you re handy with power tools and woodwork than you might be able to modify it it is a simple design,positive
these covers are not even close to being red the are wine or burgundy in color,negative
i purchased this item after having read about banneton in the book rustic european breads from your bread machine the picture clearly shows 4 baskets and the description is vague but you only get one the basket you get is quite small all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket it looks sturdy and well made it would have been good value for four baskets it was too much to pay for a single basket i didn t actually use it choosing instead to return it so i can t comment on how well it worked,negative
great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken amazon how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn t pack them well enough for shipping amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic i ve received two of those lovely surprises the first set i ordered and the replacement set oh boy i give up the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard they break amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement \( in this case \) so it s like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage are you feeling lucky if so then roll the dice,negative
wow this salter kitchen scales is highly accurate i always get a perfect bake everytime i definitely recommend this product you ll never be disapointed with its quality,positive
i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right,positive
they aren t kidding this thing is razor sharp it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight which is unfortunate because i like the weight for chopping but the hollow edge design is wonderful the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper and didn t stick to the blade i d recommend it,positive
twixit clips are a wonderful product they are extremely practical and very useful for all types of packages i hope you continue to carry them everyone i have given them to raves about them and wonders how they got along without them i highly recommend twixits,positive
this mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months it would work one day and then not work the next whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today no matter what the features an appliance has that rates an automatic 1 star in my book,negative
the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn t work disappointing,negative
this item did not work when i got it i returned it to zelco who informed me that it was my error they did not do refunds and returned it to me i had a previous model zelco that worked great for 10 15 years it had a switch this new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off gr,negative
this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup eliminating the scoop step it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate along with cup amounts the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on however anyways bottom line it grinds great with little mess,positive
great pot i m annoyed at having to press the unlock button everytime the one that prevents accidental spills the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes i m used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differences i m also really annoyed at the shipping bought through amazon it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in which wasn t up for the rigors of shipping but honestly i can t tell if the gaping crowbar looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no,positive
for what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months i really like foaming soap because i have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there isn t the big mess to clean but i have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap i searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and cuisipro was about all i could find but within 3 months the pump started to stick and i have to manually move it up and down it s cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick,negative
never got it to work all i get when i hit the on tare button is in the trash it goes,negative
do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over nice work guys one call to their customer service line was cut off on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back unfortunately the mailbox was full i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service,negative

i have used one crock pot or another for many years i bought this one because i was delighted with the sturdy removable stoneware bowl i really like this feature clean up is easy i use this crock pot for soups and beans because it cooks way too hot for anything else even so i need to stir from time to time apparently excessive temperature is the problem most people are having with this pot this might be a safety issue i would not keep this pot on and leave the house i am disappointed that the handle has broken off of the lid which really should not happen with normal use i lifted the lid to stir of course and off came the handle lifting the lid is definately normal use,negative

i bought this machine after researching it for a long time i could deal with the hard cleaning of it i was willing to shell out 100 00 for a good quality maker and i loved the design after two or three uses it started to leak after much searching i realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short i paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly i didn t return it i just will never buy bodum again,negative
this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing it is luke cold i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave it is hard to clean and very loud,negative

i was looking for an offset serrated knife as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill outstanding veggie slicer and all around food prep instrument even over ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights,positive

i have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the senseo coffeemaker folding filter paper didn t work too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee the quick cup sounded like a good idea but it doesn t fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee i found that the eco pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well the key to any of these re usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter the pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee the quick cup and the eco pad are essentially the same design but the eco pad fits the holder correctly and the quick cup is slightly small buy the eco pad it works the quick cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the quick cup and the holder a gasket to prevent the water from going around good luck,negative
we have some pretty nasty water from the tap but this pur filter system makes it taste so good i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once the hand held ones i ve used hold about 3 i don t know how pure the water is but it sure tastes great,positive
looks quite cheap not as good from the pictur,negative
apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new s5 series of miele vacuum cleaners the features price and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models nor even across series many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones they have fancy names like capricorn red velvet and champagne leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car if your browser has tabbed browsing \( e g firefox \) the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele s website and open a tab for each model you re interested in flip back and forth to see what text changes callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series \( newest technology motor \) that still comes with an electronically powered brush \( the 4th pisces model is turbo \) after 3 months of extensive use pros agility the 10 wide seb217 3 electric powerbrush comes standard and one of the reasons i chose this model for me smaller is better while other vacuums advertise large 13 power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe i don t have much open carpet space coffee tables chairs weight benches and computers all need vacuuming around and under the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners brush duster the most commonly used attachment \( for me \) the brush duster is also small \( slightly larger in diameter than the hose \) and the bristles are durable it s angled by default but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out this is not mentioned anywhere you just have to figure this out for yourself on low power i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk parquet floor brush initially i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included but this wider brush duster actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better on the negative side you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for genuine horse bristles there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don t get separated for life \( the powerbrush takes precedence \) cord rewind the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time something like 15 for 15 times \( the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat \) cons price after all it s just a vacuum cleaner there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s5 series at least when i bought this everywhere i checked \( maybe 10 websites \) the price was exactly 799 or 799 95 with the only difference being no tax and or free shipping one website even advertised the lowest price allowed what s a diamond dealer is this amway release buttons the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive being on the part that comes off rather than on the part that stays behind therefore you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with the hose extension button is particularly confusing it s an oval shaped rocker button that rocks very little to extend the stainless steel hose you have to remember which side of the button \( top or bottom \) to press there is no distinction on which side to press and it s always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button stiff no swivel hose the hose rotates at the top \( handle area \) but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists i d rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists the flex hose diameter is larger than i m used to making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner considering the price an electrical slip ring would have been nice bag full indicator the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full right out of the box on short carpet it indicated bag full on high power as i turned the power down it indicated less full sequentially you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator even at that there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator extra stuff the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose \( button doesn t easily click into place \) the extension isn t needed to connect the parquet brush so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it to this day i still haven t figured out what the extension is for other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life \( along with the parquet brush normal filter cage and replacement bags \) symbol marking the power symbol markings are not obvious at all contrary to claims other than the symbols labels min and max you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise the quite mode is 4 of 6 settings \( with 6 being the highest \) and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the normal operating mode i think most people will consider max the default mode optional filter frame this model comes with a hepa filter so you don t need the filter frame unless you re going to switch to the normal filters but brand new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping you don t even need the handle for the frame to function properly but for the kind of money i paid nothing should be broken out of the box the vendor that i bought it from \( best vacuum \) replaced it for free so is it worth 800 it does a good job but only time will tell,positive
this is a big saucepan i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines this has become my favorite pot for many things from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night the see through lid is great for monitoring food as it s cooking and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look and i love it,positive
works looks good fits in the fridge well enough i m happy with it,positive
i purchased the smallest version the lw 14 for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows air ionizers didn t rid the air of the frying smells but this appliance works the initial price is high but not the cost to keep the venta running water is cheap power consumption on highest setting is about 35 watt for whisper quiet use in a bedroom a lower setting is better any air con would be much louder anyways and drown out the venta on the highest setting the motor used to power the machine is indeed very silent and possible can t be manufactured for 30 the other components are ruggedly constructed and hopefully last many years the device can also be used for aromatherapy which i m just testing with some natural mint oil against my cold,positive
i have had this scale for about 4 months it worked fine the few times i used it but last night i went to use it and it has given up the ghost i swapped batteries and still nothing the connection for the 9v battery is very loose and even after crimping and holding it tight it didn t get any juice not happy so i will order a different brand and hope it does better i do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets so maybe i just got a lemon,negative

i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one the pampered chef one works better than this one however this is not a horrible product one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you can t see through this one to see how high the oil level is you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway and when it is less than 1 3 full you need to fill it back up or it won t work as well this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level it almost won t spray if the level is too low but since you can t see through it even holding it up to the light you have to look down in and estimate how high it is the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is you don t want to fill it all the way up either then you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped this one sprays a very fine spray finer than the pampered chef one and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there i think i know why my old one got clogged so i m trying something new each time i m done before i put it away i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure i think if you leave it pressured up all the time like i did with my old one it damages the nozzle over time but time will tell if i m right another tip don t fill it with anything but olive oil other oils evaporate and leave a sticky greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it olive oil doesn t do that that s why i now don t use anything else on my stovetop \( except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying \) this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it trust me but if you have a choice go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer it s cheaper and better quality,positive

i received this coffeemaker as a christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket style filter after using the maker for a week i have to say my skepticism was unjustified this machine makes great tasting coffee that is as hot as i could want it i never liked the cooked coffee that regular glass carafe makers produced burned tasting after the first cup the coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last i fill the carafe with hot water mill my beans and fill the reservoir empty the carafe and enjoy after two hours the coffee was still hot one great feature not highlighted is the front fill aspect kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front right next to the filter no more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level extremely convenient i have to disagree with the previous reviewer this machine makes ten 5 ounce cups after reading the review i double checked the carafe capacity against my old krups machine exactly 10 cups more than enough for our household all in all a great looking great performing coffeemaker that meets kitchenaid s high standards i highly recommend it,positive

this grill pan heats relatively evenly and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously it leaves nice grill marks on the food and works well overall the press that comes with it is very nice to have as it helps cook food faster however it has one major drawback it makes a very odd smell when it is used regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product i have a number of higher end calphalon non stick pans and none of them make this smell making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan bottom line if i had to do it over again i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead,negative
see other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning cool design but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press i only used this coffee maker 3 times and reverted to the press,negative
i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity cost and excellent coffee this has all three the first two or three times i tried this the coffee didn t come out that good either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day the other good news i ve now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress,positive

i have used patton air circulators for the last twenty years and if you are looking for something much more effecient than the common box fan that you see in department stores this is really a fan the first one i bought had the c f m rating on it which was 9600 they don t put that on the fan anymore but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate some air and can be adjusted to blow straight up nothing i have seen even comes close for the money,positive

this coffeemaker is a huge disappointment the stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere and if you do not use additional paper filters you get coffee grains in summary a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee the plus the water filter but that is it,negative
when i was looking to purchase a new machine i only was looking for a bunn bunn makes the best coffee machines none can compare every diner coffee house and dunkin donuts only use bunn machines the a10 is one great machine brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly everyone in my office is very happy with the unit if you re a serious coffee drinker please don t cheap out on a mr coffee braun or krupps frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed temperature or taste of a bunn unit i bought the a10 to replace a bunn unit that i used for 10 years without a glitch,positive
this is a great pan aside from the fact that it is easily the best non stick on the market \( and i have used anolon calphalon and scanpan \) what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution there are no hot spots not even the center when sauteing the food colours evenly \( even when the pan is a little overcrowded \) when stewing you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food demonstrating how even the heat distribution is this pan also makes a fine risotto oh and did i mention its non stick is simply the best clean up is a breeze nothing sticks even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan swiss diamond is the king of non stick as not only is their surface no 1 but the quality of their pans is second to none i own two swiss diamond pieces i plan to buy more and i couldn t recommend these pans more highly this is the pan i reach for the most,positive

unless you love the look of this pepper grinder i d suggest you look elsewhere when compared to a generic grinder this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds i ve gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them with this grinder you ll always get a huge variation in the grind some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable you ll have trouble turning it not recommended,negative

i ve been a chef for almost 15 years and a knife is one of the tools i reach out most of the time during those years i ve used all kinds of brands including kershaw wusthof mundial and even smart and final brand and to be more specific an 8 inch chef s knife is my favorite after having fun with these toys i thought it s time to reward myself with an ultimate gift so i sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive one day i came across the shun classic on the amazon web this knife sets itself apart from the others the simplicity in design the beauty of the blade the sharpness and finally its steel quality the blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a samurai s sword wow the d shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood it fits in my hand nicely but the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness i can slice pieces of lemons micro thin it s not only super sharp but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels i experienced with it weighs a little heavier but i m sure that s not a big deal for me cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there isn t any corner which will accumulate grease shun 8 inch classic is the best i ve ever had you won t regret what you pay for even though the price is very high a good chef deserves a good steel,positive

i ve had this coffeemaker for two weeks i bought it because i had an old mr coffee that worked fine but was white and stained i liked that this was black and looked sleek the very second time i used it the off button stuck so you can no longer turn off the machine but have to wait for it to turn itself off also every pot has grounds in it i m using the filters that came with it and have never even filled it to capacity and i can t figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee piece of junk don t buy it,negative
i checked out this machine at a local store it s little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine for that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately regarding this delonghi machine on the drip coffee side metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds on the espresso side you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make and then empty the strainer when you re done the optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee for only a bit more money \( 500 or so \) you can get a full automatic espresso cappuccino maker i bought a full automatic several years ago and my family loves it full automatics grind the beans for each cup they make excellent american style coffee as well \( simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee \) and you dispose of grounds once a week the only disadvantage of full automatics is that like every espresso machine they do only one or two cups at a time so if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once you ll need a plain old coffee maker like the right hand side of the delonghi,negative
i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up big people food for my grandson it could not even grind up a soft hot dog we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material \( painted gray to look like metal \) it just couldn t do the job sheesh i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder total waste of money also my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two junk,negative

got this tea kettle for a gift recently it s discontinued on amazon but they sell it at home goods for 24 99 pros asthetically pleasing \( looks pretty \) removable top for wide area to fill with water and makes it easier to wash removable whistle \( i can t stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle so i remove the plug \) cons it d be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up plug on the spout instead of the removable one \( i ll lose it eventually the other le creuset models have the flip up plug that opens with a press of the thumb \) the poor design of the spout is dangerous no matter how slowly i pour the boiling water \( even with the small amount i use only 4 or 6 ounces at a time \) a few tablespoons of water blub out very quickly sorry i can t think of a better descriptive word the spout opening is way too small but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water so the first few tablespoons gush out so when you pour the water do it as slowly as possible put the mug on your counter or another surface that won t get ruined when wet and don t hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the blub of boiling water will burn,negative

i have used this vacuum for over a year now i consistently have trouble with the belts staying on i cannot count the number of times i ve had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts if it even rolls over something uneven on the floor the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving also although bagless sounded great this vacuum is very very messy to clean out i have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere it also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments i write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached i have taken this vacuum apart for the last time,negative

the other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have it pales in comparison to my old hamilton beach however in several respects well really one big one it s a plastic object and it gets very hot too hot hot enough that it smells like it s melting itself i got this as a gift rinsed it thorougly boiled a pot just to clean it and it stunk like melted plastic ran it again to try and get the smell out same thing rinsed it with cold water and tried again still melted odor the outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off \( a problem i didn t have with my previous kettle which i lost in a move \) and when i touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger you can bet i put this right in the mail back to amazon i normally would hesitate to return a gift but i d rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust,negative

i have been using these filters for years my first impression with them is that they are very expensive my second impression is that they might not work as well as i thought they did i recently bought a water distiller and i have been experimenting with different sources of water in it i have used hot water directly from the tap cold water directly from the tap and brita filtered water in the distiller the brita filtered water left the most residue in the distiller which is very disconcerting the filters let out small amounts of carbon all the time into the top of their proprietry resevoir in the directions it says to slowly add water to the filtering well which is what i do but it still leaches at least thirty little pieces of carbon in the prefiltered water i want clean water not water with small pieces of carbon floating in the filling well i have always wanted to believe the filters were working but now am very skeptical,negative

once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and i will get a half of a pot of coffee the big problem with this piece of junk that the coffee maker was under a cabinet and the steam was ruining the kitchen cabinet i say this is 199 down the drain i have never had problems with a coffee maker spitting steam out the back and no water dripping into the pot stay away from this garbage i am not even interested in contacting krups for any warranty repair because it is not worth it,negative
i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully,positive
my kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40 my wife and i limit their exposure when we can an example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye recently they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle we figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers the ability to make jerky was a bonus for me i ordered another brand that i thought was going to do the job but once it arrived i found the construction to be subpar and it was passive requiring rotation of the trays i immediately sent it back to amazon thats when i ordered this nesco unit it is powerful and effective i have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers i have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them order this and you can t go wrong,positive

i bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor s mutt the offending dog is often left on the neighbor s porch where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by before ordering i had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect in my case the neighbor s porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine unfortunately this was not too close for comfort as far as the dog was concerned having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices i was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working alas it did not some dogs just don t hear them in my case it was probably due at least in part to the distance my suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20 of the target if it doesn t work go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund \( which is exactly what i did \) by the way you don t need an ra \( aka rma \) number to return the device just send it to the company along with your receipt and a note saying that you would like a refund \( not an exchange \) \( \) i sympathize with anyone having this problem and wish you all the best of luck no one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason and the argument that dogs bark simply does not hold any water,negative
i bought this set after the recent issues with teflon i did my research on all non teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may \( key word here is may \) contribute to alzheimer s \( according to some \) and the stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods both of which i am allergic too pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive a good set of a few items are 600 there are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by corning pyrex called visionware \( also known as visions \) that can be found on ebay \( and a few are left here on amazon \) as they are no longer in production finally there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternatives the items have been great so far however you will really want to do some research in google \( or any other search engine \) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really shouldn t do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water \( it will crack or break \) etc in addition you will also want to so some research on how to season them which makes them very close to being non stick \( you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and bake the pans for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit \) i did this and i just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick teflon pan but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan the downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you cannot stick the pan into the dishwasher \( and i tried it will come out a little bit rustier but the little rust does come off very easily \) the sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me so i think i will buy one more in a larger size the upsides are price no chemicals \( except for some iron \) in your food easy to care for and very non stick when seasoned this is a great starter set,positive

this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it doesn t create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one,negative
great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice you have to spray the pan really really well with cooking spray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow the cornbread to come out in one piece i run a little spatula around the edges before i dump the pan gave one as a gift at christmas and it was a hit,positive

it is a very lovely two piece set and amazon shipped it to me twice and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards i gave up but from what i could tell from the remains this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear i m not sure considering the shipping problems whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher,negative
i bought one of these twenty years ago and it took this long for it to finally stop working i find it easy to insert the cans it works great if you follow the directions it s not made to support the cans you must cradle the can as it goes around cleaning is simple because the blade and all pops out so you can stick them in the dishwasher or the sink it s a good buy,positive
i m certainly glad to have this pointer you d never know it is inexpensive since it looks quite sleek \( like a fountain pen though heavier for sure \) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance pleasantly sensitive to the touch it needs no fussing you d have to have pretty specialized needs to want a more expensive model,positive

after reading reviews on the wok s available on amazon com i decided on this wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher but it is very easy to hand clean the non stick surface has lasted but i am careful to only use plasic or wood and i wash it with a cloth and soap it gets to temperature quickly during cooking the only complaint i have is the simmer cycles \( not a constant heat but on and off \) i purchased some thai cook books \( real thai and thailand the beautiful cook book \) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a wok how easy it is to prepare my favorite food the difference the wok made i was able to cook at the correct temperatures my stove btu is apparently quite low it took forever to sizzle so the food turned to mush before it was cooked i now use the wok for anything i want to cook fast and or warm up,positive

we have an aussie healer mix \( we think she was a foundling \) with a thick soft coat i ve had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at 60 to 75 a pop so last summer i decided to try it myself with this clipper kit to make a long story short she didn t turn out so bad \( well the neighbors didn t laugh anyway \) it took me a while to get the hang of it i finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers but she didn t complain and i had a cool dog for much less than a pro cut the best part was i could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back no report as yet how long the blades last but i m already money ahead even if i must replace them next year,positive
this is an incredibly beautiful knife with an excellent weight well balanced the damascus steel is just so nice my husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative this is our third expensive kitchen knife and i would say that in terms of general use meat to vegetables this is my second favorite with my large 8 henckel being my best knife the shun is much nicer than the wusthof prix ii which sports the comparable santoku shape my complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle making this a much better knife for filleting motions of which i do few it s marketed toward general chopping and slicing but i find that slant makes my cuts less precise it s still my husband s favorite but since i m the one who does the majority of the cooking i d still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands but it s a real marvel to behold and i love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel,positive

being used to the swiftness of the roomba \( 10 stars \) the scooba seems very slow it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle the floor is clean and sweet smelling on the downside my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine,positive

i am not a coffee connoisseur so my criteria for a good coffee maker is probably modest i bought the ka javastudio because i own several ka appliances and have always been pleased although the ka 10 cup is pricey i felt that buying a thermal carafe represented an upgrade from my previous glass carafe i also figured that the wide spray mechanism might mean a richer cup of coffee i did as much research as i could reading reviews and looking at available coffee makers in my area after trying out our new ka yesterday my husband and i were both disappointed in its functionality and performance here are some points to consider about this product 1 the ka 10 cup makes 4 1 4 oz cups in other words if you re looking for 8 ounce servings the most this will make is about 5 real cups of coffee 2 the thermal carafe is heavy if you re planning on keeping this on your counter and possibly under a cabinet it is a tug to pull it out each time you use it to pour water in the back 3 there is no way to figure out the water level in the tank the directions say to use the optional white water filter insert 4 for us at least taste wise there is no discernible difference between what the ka brewed and what we ve tolerated with our old coffee maker good luck with your search for a more perfect coffee maker,negative

i could not resist trying this method of making espresso you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have there are a few tricks with the frother \( 1 milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile \) the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon pump it quickly and serve regarding the espresso maker itself just don t add any more water than to that line and oh don t open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done very quick and yummm,positive
you may as well put your betta in a glass of water the argument is that bettas are naturally found in rice paddies in thailand go ahead and google images of a rice paddy bettas can live in small areas due to a special lung that lets them breathe air directly humans can live in cars but should they and the tiny stick of bamboo is a joke adding insult to injury they have nothing to retreat or hide behind at all in this kit bettas were not put on this earth to make your office pretty if you want a betta get them a proper tank,negative
do your banana s turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them this used to be a huge problem in my house but now that i have the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger this is no longer an issue i hang my bananas up the moment i get home from the grocery store they think they are still on the tree out in the wild silly bananas green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer once i got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger is compact and doesn t take up much counter space which is a definite plus and it s almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display,positive

i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone the coffee does taste funny and i didn t realize it might be the metal pot also do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out just like one of the other reviewers said the pot does not slide in and out easily not a coffeemaker i would recommend the only thing i like about it is the size,negative
not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust it is really useful on those thick pizzas like spinach and feta plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board i almost never use it for any non pizza cooking and a heavy sharp knife works almost as well however it s a fun item and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza i definitely recommend it,positive

as everyone else has indicated programming isn t intuitive the opening was larger than necessary and my cats learned to stick their paws up inside the machine to steal more food within a few days we blocked off half of the food shute by using two very small screws and heavy duty plastic and the cats were no longer able to sneak food between feedings prior to using this feeder the cats would wake us up at the crack of dawn crying for food now they associate feedings with the machine and leave us to sleep in peace well worth the money for us,positive
i was shopping in a gift store today and came across this tovolo tea infuser and it is brillant if you don t use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain this will spoil you it stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it doesn t drip on anything and the whole thing is dishwasher safe i paid more than 9 95 for mine too,positive

the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan,negative
poor carafe design makes this mr coffee machine a waste of money we bought this model to replace our old mr coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn t purchase a replacement for that model we loved our old mr coffee but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because as other reviewers have noted it s virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee water everywere after the first few uses we decided to purchase a different coffee maker,negative

i have really nice dansk everyday dishes but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use i have to admit these dishes are really stylish they look great on the table are very lightweight stack very compactly and are a nice large size the only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls they are small and while they look really cool the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around if you re looking for bigger bowls for cereal you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that corelle makes for salads the square ones work just fine a word of pricing caution on amazon at this moment they are 69 a set i bought mine for 49 per set at my local walmart,positive

i ve been using spiegelau wine glasses for several years and they are excellent the bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine these glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine \( they re also not bad for rhones though i prefer the reidel vinum syrah glass \) if you drink a lot of burgundy or pinot noir or italian piedmont wines \( barolo barbaresco langhe \) i d suggest spiegelau s burgundy glass if your preference is zinfandel or chianti you re a bit out of luck with spiegelau however their chianti glass isn t very good try the riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines you ll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet some reviewers have complained about breakage i ve seldom broken a glass but it does occasionally happen during washing my method is to clear the sink run the water as hot as possible put a bit of dishsoap in each glass i then use a special ultra soft brush \( which i got at a local wine shop for about 6 \) to clean the glass removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim then rinse thoroughly with very hot water invert on cloth after about half an hour with the glasses almost dry you can wipe them off with paper towels \( which don t leave any lint behind \) and put them away the main thing is never to lay them down in the sink and wash one glass at a time just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you re doing don t try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying just use the paper towels finally even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe i don t know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher dishwashers always leave a film and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses which lose their clarity as a consequence,positive

this was one pattern that both my wife and i could agree on the design is clean and interesting and should fit with most decors i purchased two of the 16 piece sets from amazon for set and with the free vegtable bowles no tax and free shipping this was by far the best deal on the internet my first set arrived with two broken salad plates and one broken dinner plate my second set arrived with one broken salad plate the repacement set arrived with one broken salad plate the vegtable bowles arrived intact the quality seems to be first rate no warped plates or design flaws but a few item did have some minor cosmetic flaws amazon was great at resolving the damaged goods issues but needs to seriously rethink the packaging of fragile items the only fault i could find with this set is that the soup bowles are a little on the small side i recommend that you read and following the cleaning and maintenance directions and this set should give many years of service,positive
i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and doesn t take a lot of counter space while you are using it its the perfect size to make pancakes eggs and bacon we used it to make grilled cheese and they came out perfect this would be great for singles college students and anyone who likes great things in small packages,positive

bought this vacuum because consumer reports picked it as one of the 2006 best buys better than dyson or rainbow this is our second eureka but this one is significantly better than the last the last was a bagless model and this one uses bags and as a result it s much easier to clean bags are quite inexpensive so it only adds about 10 15 per year \( 6 9 bags \) suction is fantastic noise is low it s easy to use and i will add that we purchased a refurbished model but we can identify no defects or differences looks perfectly new and runs great so the choice is yours dyson for 400 or this one which is better for 99,positive

my mother in law and i both had this blender hers broke in a couple of months i was lucky that mine lasted a couple of years it is a great blender for crushing ice for smoothies icees etc however it has a flaw that the piece that the pitcher sits on when it spins is made out of plastic it eventually cracks from the heat friction produced i bought the oster beehive blender to replace it and it has a metal piece beneath it and i have had it for a few years now with no problem i am even happier with the oster beehive blender as it is a much better quality blender which will last a lot longer than the cuisinart one \( it was also cheaper \) and it crushes ice exactly as good if not better than the cuisinart blender,negative
first off i paid 25 00 for this at walmart so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for 54 00 secondly it works fine for the amt of money i spent thirdly my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it i will have to put ear plugs in seriously this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm i have an email in to eureka com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to,negative
no stars i recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated but due to the leaking issues w the filter basket overflowing you may also notice that the water never completely drains staying at the 2 cup line causing mold milldew to grow \( despite proper cleaning maintenance \) this is the reason for the bad tasting coffee also the reason for my current various medical conditions i am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues i am being faced with please do not purchase any mr coffee sunbeam products this is the exact model i own but nearly every model has the same defective construction consumer complaints check the better business bureau consumer affairs you will be shocked at what you find about mr coffee sunbeam they have almost gone bankrupt from class action lawsuits more than once if anyone has a similar situation with any mr coffee brand coffee makers please contact me asap my email address is angidougherty yahoo com people are suffering because of this hazardous product may not even know it toxic mold poisoning is very serious can be deadly especially through drinking it in your morning coffee yum,negative

i say nearly useless because the ceramic pot is a nice size and weight for melting chocolate in the microwave \( which is what you ll have to do \) and the warmer makes a decent trivet but it does not ever get hot enough to actually melt the chocolate we followed the directions and allwed 1 2 hour for the chocolate to melt \( putting chips in as we started dinner \) half an hour later some of the chocolate \( on the outside of the crock by the burner coil \) had melted a bit an hour passed still nothing much now given that cocoa butter melts at body temperature \( which is why it is used in cosmetics \) that s saying something the pot never reached 98 degrees if i d put the chips in a zip lock in my lap during dinner i would have had better results since this was a relatively inexpensive item and i got it effectively for free during amazon s recent valentine s day promotion i did not send it back \( thinking it would be unfair to make them pay shipping both ways on an item which costs near as much to ship as it does to buy \) but if you are actually paying for this don t bother \( or at least be advised that it will not actually melt the chocolate \) it does do a reasonable job of holding the temperature once you ve melted the chocolate some other way,negative
this was a special offer and the price seemed excellent description stated standard classic white goose down feather pillow a more accurate description would have been mostly feather pillow with some goose down skimpily filled i would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate i e larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content as they did with other catalog items i believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was caveat emptor,negative
i loved this blender while it was working i mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit i love that it has seamless buttons so food can t get caught in little cracks i rarely used the food processor after about 11 months mine also started to smell like it was catching fire however it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar which was basically being shaved by the base motor i had to order a replacement blender cutting assembly from the cuisinart website for 15 with shipping only to have it happen again plus it was a pain to clean the base threading didn t match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult we ve replaced the blender with another brand but i have kept the bottom motor part for the processor,negative
this looks like a good idea from westinghouse but if you read the warranty details the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10 year warranty 10 00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years but not really what is the point extra tape isn t even included when the first strip fails i suggest you use a flashlight,negative

i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money,negative

the machine looks great it sat nicely on our counter top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy if that was all i wanted to do with it then i would have been very happy with it but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos firstly i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use it rotates but has little movement up or down as a result i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter top when i was finished it produced good foam though secondly the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not finally the espressos i made had no crema at all i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere in summary if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter buy this machine if you want to make decent espresso based drinks don t,negative
i love that it has a mini bowl so much less storage also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach i am so impressed love kitchen aid anything,positive
ok well unlike the other reviewers i hate this ice cream scoop yes it s heavy and seems to be well engineered however i don t like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it and as another reviewer already mentioned it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed when i m scooping the ice cream the water drips out and down the handle thus making it even harder to grip the handle it makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and i get ice cream all over my hand i have a cheap 2 plastic scoop that i bought when i was in college and i prefer it to this one,negative

the problem with this is that \( as it appears to me \) villaware has tried to cut corners by re using all but the plates as it has on it s panini grill \( which for the record is an excellent product which i have given rave reviews \) check out the panini grill unless you had these products in front of you were able to open them up you d never be able to tell the difference between them i would say don t write off villaware products just because of one poor one as i said i also own the panini grill love it however don t waste your money on this one i hope villaware does right by their respected name pulls this off the market completely one thing i will say the audible warning sound that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click the same as the panini grill but listen carefully or you ll miss it,negative

it s true you have to put the whole silly thing together yourself but that is why it is the price it is once put together it is lightweight and easy to move to where you want it i recommend putting it together on a hard surface we used a piece of plywood when you try to put it together on carpet the mallet doesn t enough force to make it work right,positive
this mug absolutely comes through as promised hot beverages stay hot even hours later it s totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning i am very pleased with this purchase the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it s size i would have preferred something a little wider but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for unfortunately it tends to move around in mine but it doesn t spill any thing,positive
i destroy cooking pots i m especially lethal to the light weight teflon lined variety you ll find at the supermarket my secret is simple i like to cook on high heat and i get easily distracted that guarantees that i ll forget what s on the stove and produce a scorched \( and warped \) utensil if a lightweight teflon pot lasts me two years it s extraordinarily lucky i now own four \( different \) swiss diamond pots and even my brutal habits leave them unimpressed despite regular disasters they seem to shrug off what would vanquish a lesser pot \( admittedly i do avoid metal spoons and spatulas and clean them with non abrasive means \) they have excellent non stick characteristics superb heat spreading and love it are approved for very hot oven use adding up to essential cooking tools and when you factor the price of regularly replacing cheaper pots their cost becomes more than bearable highly recommended,positive

when trying to decide if this model \( 3670g \) was the right vacuum for me i found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it s features on the internet and from the manufacturer itself first of all many online retailers flat out state \( inaccurately \) that this model has a hepa \( high efficiency particulate air \) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on amazon \( at least as of this writing \) seems to indicate that it has one as well i can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does not have a hepa filter more on that a little later in this review however i found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number \( i e 3670g \) be careful to understand the difference between what amazon calls the 3670 \( also called the 3670a in some places \) and the 3670 g models they look identical and appear to be identical \( both are yellow and black \) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670g has the larger 12 amp motor amazon carries both models and i almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum for only about a 5 10 difference in total price i m not sure why the smaller version is even offered it only seems to confuse the matter the 3670 also does not have the hepa filter incidentally i found the 3670g to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase it is compact very powerful and great for my needs the noise while high is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans the generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful not having one is a reasonable trade off in keeping the price down the blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides \( by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing \) the 3670g does require bags it is not a bagless model however and while some may prefer a bagless model i preferred a model that used bags the bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what i consider to be the additional convenience \( of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag \) the only reason i gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because i did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate three attachment tools are included a crevice tool a 10 floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly shaped brush \( about 2 wide \) on the end the combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick up \( 3 wide \) in my opinion this cleaner badly needs a mid sized brush and or pick up tool that is about 4 5 wide the 2 wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2 wide i found that i simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces \( such as a wall for example \) in order to cover the area needed i would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4 5 wide had been included as it is i am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra finally a comment about the hepa filter some people \( particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air \) may want cleaners that include this item in my case i did not want this since i don t need it and hepa filters can be quite expensive to change and replace \( unless you get a washable one also expensive \) since many online descriptions i found were unclear whether the 3670g included this filter \( some descriptions flatly stated that it does \) i found myself calling the eureka customer service number to find out for sure it turned out that even eureka s own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn t have one if you do want the hepa filter you would want the 3684d which looks the same but is red in color slightly more expensive and has more and better quality attachments as well as the hepa filter by the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment \( which i mentioned earlier that i think is needed on the 3670g \) you are at the price of a 3684d in that case the 3684d may well be a better value for you particularly if you like the hepa filter overall i think the boss series of canister vacuums is a great product eureka \( and amazon as well \) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however,positive
yes it is pretty no it is not a good teapot i have made tea for over 40 years in all sorts of pots and this is right up there with the worst it drips a lot perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout and no it does not drip from the spout rather lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot this happens with both fast and slow pouring with full and near empty pots this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot just too much mopping up,negative

i was lucky to get the stainless popper on clearance it is wonderful we have used it for several months now it is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn i am so disappointed that target is not carrying the stainless model anymore my college children who don t live at home want their own even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan i m sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models when i bought mine i chose stainless because i knew it could handle the high heat well and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher hey target how about carrying the stainless model again,positive
i bought this when my air popper died i am so glad i found this product the popcorn is the best it is very simple to make the thing i like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn i can choose which oil to use how much so i have total control over what goes into my popcorn so i feel confident that what i am eating is good for me the packaged corn that came with was ok a good introduction to using the popper but i will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own i did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book it was fantastic i would recommend this to anyone the popper is easy to handle easy to clean it makes the best crisp crunchy popcorn ever it only takes about 3 minutes to be done you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings sometimes simple old fashioned is better that is the case with this item now we can t wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night,positive

well i have a toy poodle and he goes crazy when he hears someone at our door we live in a tiny studio in nyc so if he hears someone going into their apt in the middle of the night he goes crazy and wakes everyone up after a lack of sleep and total frustration i got this collar it work until one night i woke up to horrible noises when i saw that my dog had attempted to slip the collar off and because of all his fur the collar was able to slide partially off but not all the way leaving the electric part in his mouth and when he whined it electrocuted his mouth so i quick unhooked it and couldnt stop freaking out so my boyfriend said that its not a bad shock its just a quick pinched so i tryed it on my neck and my god was it powerful it burned and paralyzed your whole area i made my boyfriend try it to just so he couldnt say i was being a p ssy we threw it right out after that i didnt even want to resell it or get my money back because i would feel too guilty giving it to anyone else my suggestion is that you get just a sound correction device with no electric correction because i learned first hand its really not humane or a spray collar that shoots out a spray of citranella or something,negative

i used this pan just this morning and i really like it it has a great non stick surface and is easy to clean the price is great also the only thing that might be a problem for some people is the handle it slants downward instead of upward so if you have a flat surface stovetop your pan won t sit flat on the surface i have a gas stove and it is not a problem for me i didn t notice this from the picture and the descriptions don t mention this but i think it is important to know who knows maybe i got a defective pan and don t know it other than that it is a great pan for the money i like it more than other non stick pans i have had,positive
i ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before but the picture on the site and the product review looked good when i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped the pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished i returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time,negative

this stone is very functional works well and goes from oven to table because of its beauty if you ve never cooked on stone before prepare to be amazed it s a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust i also use the stone for baking french fries and other stuff just put the pan directly on the stone and your food will be done faster with use your stone will discolor this happens with any stone you also should not wash any stone with soap use hot water and a plastic scraper to clean this is the only all clad product i have that i can t get the stainless to sparkle like new i think it s because i left it in the oven so much the pizza cutter that comes with this is the best i ve ever used because of its size this product is great as a bake and serve occasional baking stone if you bake a ton i suggest getting a larger stone and just leaving it the oven all the time,positive
i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces needless to say it s useless this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last,negative

i have a lot of low voltage lights on our house many colors and different wattages which i dearly love unfortunately the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights one night i used my panasonic vacuum \( which i love \) and got over 30 the motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag i ve never had one survive nice jolly subject right often i have to hold the vacuum in one hand \( 20 lbs \) while using the hose with attachment in the other this gives me over 3 ft of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is gone within 1 of the brush ok the lentek is rechargeable doesn t have a power cord and is lite \( albeit unwieldly \) after charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1 8 spider but nothing larger after a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you won t get anything then yes i m back to the panasonic and the lentek the round file,negative
i ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback we followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee after that the machine said ventilate we followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself went to make another cup of coffee and it said ventilate this time it would not fix itself i tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray turn off the knob and ventilate comes back up on the screen turn the machine off and turn it back on ventilate came up on the screen we called amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later \( thank you amazon \) unfortunately this one i did not get cup one out of the machine it read ventilate as soon as i turned it on the difference is with this one no water would come out at all gaggia provides no customer support so you are on your own with this unit,negative

i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities its so light about nine pounds and easy to transport and store its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum they are very easy to get at and change its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors along baseboards and on stairways not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool many third party vacuum attachments would work with it too i am glad i bought it and would recommend it its the vacuum i would use most the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done push a button and the cord automatically rewinds whats not to like about this vacuum highly recommended,positive

beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews,negative

when my krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service i decided to order the capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted cool grind i wish i had ordered the krups instead the capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee and the design ensures that no matter how careful you are you will spill ground coffee all over your counter in the time since i bought it another reviewer has reported that his or her capresso broke within six months do not buy this model,negative
not too happy with this small pizza stone before i ordered this one for a long time i had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking i couldnt find these bricks again i had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now but they were so much better than this small round stone my bricks made my pizza crust so crispy and this stone is a poor substitute for this my bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf if anyone knows what i am writing about pls email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name i am not happy with this pizza set the rack is of no use the pizza cutter is a cheap one they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras,negative

i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i d buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one,negative
i previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal so i bought these as replacements the previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal the rubber sections on these are so thin that they didn t even seal the wine bottle i first tried them on all three stoppers in the set had the same problem oxygen and leakage are death to a wine so a stopper that doesn t seal is worse than just replacing the cork,negative

i purchased this in cobalt blue it goes with my fiestaware dishes as well as my pzaltsgraf and longerberger pottery i also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful and much nicer in person than online it has a large capacity and pleasing lines i ll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals to be able to use more than one,positive

we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender the cuisinart took care of the problem pros very good power for blending good battery charge life easy to clean clever modular construction \( battery separates from motor built in plug and charger \) does not roll off counter cons larger and heavier than the corder braun this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 long the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth making clean up easy i don t recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft hand washing is easy and quick one reviewer suggested that cuisinart s recommendation of leaving the battery pack charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries this may shorten the battery life but the charger charges them at a very slow rate this protects the batteries from what really damages them heat from fast charging as the charger draws only 1 watt of current some may want to leave it plugged in continuously current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power don t run them down completely as was the practice in the past the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight they don t feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life,positive
i would not recommend purchasing these sheets they are thin not very soft and they wrinkle easily,negative

i am not fond of this particular microwave because of the loud clunky sound of the door opening poor in my opinion i can t believe that i will probably put up with this for years as i use my microwave several times a day my husband just complained that the start button is hidden on the user display among the other buttons seems like there should some sort of user standards for display input like power buttons in the upper left corner most used buttons should be large maybe in a special color i like the web 2 0 look that is developing on user interfaces no user interface should make the user feel stupid is my thought i asked my husband what was the brand name and he said sharp so even if cheap i think sharp ought to protect the brand image but i see that i am in the minority of opinions here maybe my advice is not order on line till you try this item out,negative
i bought these for a wonderful craft i was expecting them to be decent but i did not expect them to be as nice as they were if i realized how nice they were then i would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping i realize that i got 100 bags but my craft took about 75 of them they are nicer than the piping icing bags that i used while i was learning cake decorating when these are gone i will definitely order more the plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out,positive

this was given to us about last christmas to replace our old one not worth it a couple months into our ownership of this item it stopped working properly the right burner remains on at all times we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off so the right burner remains on hi all the time and the left burner is either lo or hi there is no concept of temperature control with this device if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things if it s a centimeter above medium it s hot if you want medium heat to work good luck it worked ok until it broke however it was never especially powerful i can t even tolerate trying to cook with it anymore i just go to the apartment downstairs and cook on my boyfriend s mom s gas stove for nice even heating but a ministove that they are dubbing professional should not be breaking after like three months,negative
this is wonderful i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me i actually enjoy working with this the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer but using really good litter and not too much of it stops that i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this,positive
i ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic however this kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water i boiled it a few times plus tried the water vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help i decided that i didn t want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so i m returning it it s not worth the risk i can t figure out if it s coming from the stainless steel bulb \( that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it \) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass the bulb plus the lid has a stong odor too that is plastic covered in stainless steel,negative

read the fine \( or missing \) print carefully this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets \( another 100 \) if you want to return this item they charge a restocking fee of 10 and also deduct for the shipment \( even if you got free shipping \) and you pay to ship the thing back we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores which is where the miele came from,negative
very nice warm blanket but too big for a full size bed way too big,positive
bought this set at target 3 years ago for 200 and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them they re heavy cooked things well and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil \( metal etc \) in them that didn t belong in them took care when washing didn t burn things in them etc somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement because i didn t want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating they had to go straight to the trash very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life with high care and high cost the 2nd star is because they are beautiful and i cooked every day with these if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these they might work for you for me stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go i wouldn t even try another non stick finish,negative

my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st amazingly i would have bought it after reading the reviews here i m starting to wonder who writes these things lg employees the microwave is fine no complaints the toaster however is an unmitigated disaster i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances this appliance is a poster child for this thought the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently \( sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10 \) more importantly the toaster broke after 31 days \( coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named ricky managing the store what can you expect \) lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty the problem is they can t think outside of the box they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up ok no problem one day later it breaks again it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not that s how bad it was lg will not budge have it repaired again \( great option costs lg money me more travel time and it won t do the job \) or do a rebate the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product huh so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace \( they admitted they don t have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new \) and then don t stand behind your product you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here our we so bad as a manufacturer that we can t top this their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this you can cal korea but they won t change their policy they said i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same shame on you lg you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me,negative

my wife and i are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats though the catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with sanisolution and granules it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement unfortunately they just don t work becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 catgenies even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly they clogged everytime and beeped incessantly another problem is the scoop even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle it always left turds behind those turds would then go through the whole cyle which includes drying that means that even if they re scooped up the next time it cycles they re going to be so dry and hard they ll never be ground up properly again this results in clogs we had them for a little over 2 weeks in that time we had to run extra cyles backflush and even take them apart and clean them this product results in far more work not less,negative

i got a set of 8 a few months ago first one package arrived with a broken one then all of them ended up broken they break if you fill them with water and try to take them by the side they break if you set them a little too fast on the table one of them broke by just holding it such poor quality i am extremely disapointed but i loved the design though,negative
having had a hoover in the past i was excited to find this one at this price i ve had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again and will not be looking at hoovers the parts are plastic and cheap and break easily it advertised a power hand tool it is not it works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning the upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months the hard wood floor tool worked fine and suction was strong enough but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments don t stay on like they should so i spend most of my time with the vacuum re attaching the pieces i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last,negative

i am glad i only paid 60 for this i see it s now up to 90 i am a bit disappointed in this purchase it does slice well so far \( although i haven t tried slicing anything really thin like prosciutto yet \) but i don t like the fact that i have to hold the on button down with one hand while cutting i also found that when i used it to slice homemade bread that the slices get stuck in between the blade and the plastic guide at the bottom so i have to stop and dislodge each slice sometimes tearing them in the process i also don t like how loud it is and the fact that it sounds like it is working really hard all the time it makes me question how long the motor is going to last the catch tray is really useless \( as someone else pointed out \) and in addition to not doing it s job it doesn t store inside or attached to the machine in any way so it just kind of gets in the way if i decide to keep the machine i am going to throw it away so all in all i gave it two stars because it is a cheap slicer \( or at least it was at 60 i am not so sure at 90 \) but it works like a cheap slicer too so you are definitely getting what you pay for,negative

i got this pan because i ve been coveting all clad when reading reviews of high end cookware and because of the low price i figured that the low price made it a teaser something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line it s a nice pan but limited on the good side it s hefty has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove heats evenly and holds the heat it is not non stick so i use it when i want the contents to produce the fabled brown bits that come up with deglazing stuff sticks unless you use a lot of fat as noted by other reviewers it does not have a pouring spout the rim is squared off so the pouring stream tends to be very wide my other major gripe is that it does not have a lid all clad lids are pricey like everything else in their line i sometimes use a cheap tempered glass lid with it i still covet all clad pans but not as much as i did before,positive

this is the most amazing knife i have ever owned i ve purchased henckles twinstars sabatier which is pure junk out of all the knives ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives i enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives i have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all global this is quite a bold move as i consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where i must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know i do not want to live without i simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and henckles twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a pandora s box of spending it actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other i must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the excaliber of knives,positive
i have been using a chemex 10 cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee there is a downside to this coffee maker it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently the first time i tried to use mine i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever the big time consumers you have to boil your water separately \( you do have a water kettle right \) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex this means that while the coffee is brewing you are pouring or watching or giving the filter area a bit of a stir now the up side you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee i use filtered water freshly ground home roasted beans and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking and this coffee is a pleasure in fact i ve totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide another up side clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new try that with your electric drip machine ha that thing will never look brand new oh here s a final upside this chemex brews the best coffee you ll ever drink and it costs less than just about anything you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks go ahead and buy yourself one of these if necessary wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee better yet wake up 20 minutes earlier and when your coffee is ready instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes you deserve it update it s been a year now and i still love this chemex however over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use nothing i tried got it clean but something my wife tried did a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing now my chemex looks brand new,positive
i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i d kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them aren t great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they re pretty but not very functional,negative
when i adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago two of my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter here s why this fresh step premium clay cat litter is excellent for your favorite kitty s litter box the company states that it is very good at absorbing odors and by golly it s true the odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat moreover i really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box that s a plus for any cat lover if you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend not surprisingly that you use more cat litter in the box otherwise if you have just one cat two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine you should change the entire litter box once a week on average \( i change mine about twice a week just for my cat s comfort \) it s also a good idea to scoop out any kitty remains every other day or so be very certain not to flush any kitty presents down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this i suppose it could clog toilet pipes moreover as you may suspect any kitty leftovers could have some nasty germs that we don t want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any kitty presents with a scooper the fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any kitty presents thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box nevertheless i recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage in short this is a great cat litter product at a great price the contents of the bag last a long time especially if like me you have only one cat the manufacturer also offers customers \( us not the cats \) an awards program with points that you can accumulate in your account with the company on the company internet website a nice plus ok fresh step i thank you my father and mother thank you and most importantly my cat says thank you smiles,positive
after reading the other reviews i almost reconsidered my purchase however the juicer works great as long as you follow a few tips 1 \) make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on tight check once then check again 2 \) don t use the paper filters particularly if you are juicing in quantity once i threw mine in the trash the balancing issues went away immediately it makes clean up a little harder but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use it s not a big deal 3 \) if the item being juiced won t go through be patient and pulse push it in don t cram it with the pusher my only concern is that when you juice quantities so much pulp sticks to the side it s hard for all of the juice out to strain out it s best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice using the above tips i expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time,positive

about a month ago a friend gave me her gf tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen in return i grilled up some home made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper i really love this grill even though it s got a big surface area it s no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away and it cleans really easily my tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm the charred stuff wipes right off i wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles like the smaller g5 version does just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby i do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage though given its size bottom line i d highly recommend this grill especially if you re using it for a family of four or more,positive
i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store it sucks wonderfully don t get me wrong the reason why it s got to be returned to targetland is because of 1 the noise 2 the dust that flies out of the dust cup when you re emptying it the noise is certainly the loudest i ve ever heard on a vacuum cleaner but i thought hey that s okay if you want to be noisy until i ventured into cleaning the stairs there s not much of an extension between the cleaning wand brush and the actual machine so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris \( what have you \) from the stairs carpet i had the crazy noise blasting turbo style directly into my ear \( this was done 15 minutes ago and my ear still hurts \) the other problem i ve found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup i am having to actually touch dirt and dust \( the entire outside of the cup is coated with it \) while pouring the dirt into the trash can a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor nasty and what s the point in the dust cup if this happens i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently \( it died after 2 1 2 years \) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup nor falling to the floor so alas my friends i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store mayhaps i ll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags \( you know the old fashioned kind \),negative

although it doesn t mention it these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150 i had to email hamilton beach to find out but they were very helpful and responded right away when the filters arrived from amazon i saw that on the box it says fits models 04160 04161 04150 with our cat and houseful of antiques we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around i run this model in our office under the table which holds the computer since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job the regular settings can be louder than expected but i leave them on the whisper quiet setting when we re in that room and i don t even notice them being on i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners,positive

the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter but it must not have been very big i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case these were brand new batteries there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them this is bad modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter but traveling i would use the batteries don t make this mistake,negative

i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances the item itself works pretty good for the most part the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it to remedy the issue i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place i m not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find i used search terms like mini trash can counter top trash can small waste basket small stainless steel trash can but none of these got me to this item i m not sure how my husband finally found it,positive

i love the large size of these tumblers as i can get a whole can of pop with ice in them the thermal feature works good the ice lasts longer and they don t sweat so i don t need coasters under them they are colorful so each guest can have their own color no mix ups they fit on the top rack of my dishwasher and they don t seem to be marked or scratched yet after seeing mine my daughter in law got some as did two sets of my friends i am so glad to have found them,positive
the knife is constructed well as pictured does not cut very well it just was not very sharp i tried mincing some vegetables it just didn t work as well as my 9 99 serrated tv info knife i was disappointed,negative
this is wonderful the best laundry basket ever used,positive
they look nice but the towels do not absorb much water i am very disappointed i suspect i ll use them a few times then give them to goodwill,negative
i bought this for my 2 dogs it works great cleans up easily the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it s large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home it doesn t fit under my kitchen sink faucet i don t have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer \( wish i did \) \) otherwise it would be a snap to fill i have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs the container is really heavy once it s full my only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one \( 2 gallon or 1 gallon \) waterer it would be easier to handle i also bought the 5 gallon feeder i love it it holds a whole 5lb bag of food which is great so get the larger feeder the smaller waterer oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it,positive
best investment i have ever made in cookware heats evenly more thoroughly and burns less amazingly tough and the best part is i don t have to hunt for special plastic utensils to mix and stir this is sweet cookware and so dang easy to clean i love it,positive
i recieved this from my husband after he got it as a gift at a secret santa party it is a really beautiful set and all the candles and accents matched what was advertized i set it up in my office \( in a different pattern from what was shown \) and it really adds a nice touch especially with its blend of soothing smells my only complaint is that one of the glass stones was broken in half and the other half could not be found it probably slipped through the quality control department at the factory but it had plenty of others to compensate so it s not a big deal i highly recommend this product especially if you like to customize and design your centerpieces rather than have them pre assembled,positive
the bed warmer was described as dual controlled it comes with only one control the entire bed has to be at the same temperature the reason i wanted dual control was because my husband is always warm and i m almost always cold hence seperate controls were needed since we had the coldest winter in years i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described it does heat well though,negative
do not bother to buy this sewing machine case it is crappy don t be fooled by the universal phrase of this product i have a brother sewing machine so i bought this item when i got it i placed my sewing machine and i rattles around inside the case i don t see what is so universal about this there is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case it s terrible i d give no star but i don t have that choice on the selection i wanted to return it but it s not worth the shipping charge that will incure on my refund due to amazon s policies by then i would probably only get at most 12 00 back in refunds,negative
my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can t beat the quality,positive
i was glad to see the unit arrived without damage \( despite poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer \) the unit works great,positive
you would never know it was reconditioned it is probably even better than new plus being dishwasher friendly makes even easier to use,positive
these pans are great they are very sturdy and good quality don t buy anything else trust me,positive
first the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner that can be overlooked but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability i may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks no matter what setting i put it on horrible to say the least i sent it back and purchased a new one which i enjoy to this day,negative
this rice cooker has a non stick bowl which makes clean up a cinch the indicator light is red when cooking and green when warming it cooks the rice perfectly every time also this cooker is small and easy to store,positive
miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure but i want to recommend the seller witbecks wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually witbecks when dhl screwed up their delivery \( an immensely crappy organization but that s another story \) he stepped in and sent another unit without delay terrific guy terrific price terrific service,positive
not a good light the light is already fading and i don t use it very often very disappointed,negative
first off this is available at the ewins site for 30 should you decide to plunge the construction of the wooden parts is pretty nice better than what you d expect for 50 but that s about the only positive thing the hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you need so you re kind of sol when the crappy aluminum cams break i m sure they d send some more if i asked but for now my piece is hanging out half way assembled because i m scared of breaking any more of the hardware either way i think i m going to ditch the cam bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up the instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web if you ve never built flat pack furniture before you will not be able to figure it out even if you have you will put something together incorrectly and have to disassemble the piece,negative
if you want the retro look and a super toaster this is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great i ve had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering it s a big toaster shape is unusual \( taller in back than the front \) which gives it a little character excellent,positive
this mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot i would expect to pay much more for such a product the grind is even and consistent the appearance is sleek and modern yet classic i would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift,positive
i actually purchased this book light so that i can read while i wait for my child to sleep he likes me to be in the room this was perfect does not put out enough light to bother my son but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while i wait for him to fall asleep,positive
we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago it has held up so well that i just purchased ten more place settings \( the friday only sale \) to use for entertaining our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold \( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from \) the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions,positive
worst product ever don t know how it passed through initial testing when you turn the crank to dispense cereal it crushes it and sprays it all over the room awful just awful too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash waste of money and space and we tried dog food which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck really made me angry that i wasted the money false advertising,negative
i have been looking for a good cheese plane and this one isn t it it works fine for rubbery semi soft cheeses like swiss but not for harder cheese like cheddar which tend to crrumble before i can finish a slice the problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid it should be thin and flexible also don t let the name fool you this utensil is made in china a country which consumes very little cheese,negative
i just got this thing 2 hours ago in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working made it through about 8oz try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot nope number one this is nothing more than a typical small hand held grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing do not buy this the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing,negative
my son who lives in washington uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer we live in california but bought this fan to help vent our computer room which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled it works great we plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down,positive
my son is a star wars nut and just loves this blanket,positive
this is a great cookie sheet i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it s durable my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality i would highly recommend this pan especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only 30 a great deal,positive
i received this item in the description is stated is was 17 inches long when in reallity it was 22 unable to use still sitting in the box unused tried to contact the 800 given by the rep to return to date no luc,negative
if i could give half a star i would i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day i used it less than 3 times a week there are several drawbacks to this unit it draws alot of electricity to run it i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on water gurgles spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned the spout is also poorly designed the water doesn t come out in an even stream it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago it is everything this kettle isn t and so much more read the reviews on that one before you buy this one its a better choice all around save the shipping costs time headache just buy the braun first and pass this one up,negative
for the price these bath sheets are great very soft and plush exactly what i was expecting,positive
i bought this sauce pan last week the quality is very good the handle design is quite comfortable i tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan i found no hot spot it responded to the change in the heat setting is average it s kind of heavier than all clad ltd for the same size of pan i m not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet for the initial impression this calphalon one non stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as all clad ltd stainless steel mc2 look for the bargain it s worth the cost,positive
let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25 year old woman who isn t really big on doing chores i got a dyson for christmas and just tried out the dusting brush last week my immediate reaction was this is genius it is great for dusting computers televisions lampshades bookcases \( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices so normal dusting never seemed to help \) the tops of books cd organizers ceiling fan blades metal bedframes i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment and it works beautifully this attachment will not disappoint trust me it s already made my life so much easier and cleaner,positive
i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet so now you don t have filtered water my husband replaced washer and it still dripped if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined,negative
there isn t much to like about these sheets they wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired hanging threads are all over the place i would not recommend these sheets at all,negative

it is big and heavy but a real workhorse mixes things we would only do by hand before,positive
i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses my wife can even use it without burning stuff which she admits is a feat for her so she uses it several times a week too it holds heat well cleans up easy and the lip on the corner works great for draining only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove with gas you should be fine it hasn t seemed to effect the performance though and for the money it is quite perfect,positive
a few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall it works like new probably not a perfect vacuum but works well parts are available if you need them not a top of the line but neither is the price at 60 70 with free shipping,positive
i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser when it arrived the teapot was broken with a large section missing from the side i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price after receiving my second teapot it was cracked in the exact same spot i returned the product and complained with no response i was refunded the price for the teapot but i am out 10 in the cost of shipping it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot so i would try a different product,negative
purchased at petsmart seems to work well very quiet when operating properly took our cats a little over a week to get used to it the flow isn t very good when the setting is low we keep it at medium i clean it out about once a week cat hair from our medium haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well,positive
the price seemed great and i really liked the modern look when i took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked assembly was very easy it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes \( the most \) the design is really great it s very compact perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better great idea poorly executed would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product my main concern is that the construction seems like it wouldn t last too long i feel like i should attach sit carefully tag to it before anybody comes over,negative
i bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker i could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it rather than 2 however i used it exactly 5 days and then it died granted the econonical price was a factor when i purchased it but i really expected it to last more than 5 days unfortunately it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed so i was forced to throw it away lesson learned some things are just not a bargain,negative
the spice rack looks nice won t know the quality until i can use it and see how much weight it will take i had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet it is definitely a 2 person job and there was only me the self adhesive tabs didn t work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws very awkward to use the screws doesn t allow for any room especially the back screws i did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible i wouldn t have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet took much too much time to get it into place,negative
i have four 16 piece sets that i received for my wedding they are beautiful plates but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use like heating food up in the microwave going through the dishwasher or serving hot food within 3 months several plates cracked down the middle making them unusable a large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added i did a search on www epinions com and found i wasn t the only person having these problems everyone is having these problems plus it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces you have to buy another set what a racket the clincher is that they are located in indonesia so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent i ve gotten nothing but the international run around,negative
this is a hollow ground blade \( not flat ground \) which does not cut straight the blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this get a knife with a flat ground blade not this one you can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade it is a cheaper way to make knives,negative
by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to non stick pans it s already taken a beating and still looks like new with no scratches it also cooks very evenly across the entire bottom surface,positive
these are simply beautiful glasses they are every bit as elegant as reidel but cost much less the glass is thin the shape is elegant they hold up well in washing i recommend them,positive
i use this in my 29 gallon and the filter is excellent the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in it is also very quiet however when the power goes out and comes back on it won t begin working again you must add water to it to get it up and running this has been a problem when i ve gone on vacation and i ve come home to cloudy water the refills are also pretty expensive and can get a bit messy it s all worth it though it keeps my tank in nice condition,positive
completely satisfied it boils fast and looks great on the kitchen counter from england so used a lot for cups of tea have tried several makes but cant beat this for quality and price m william,positive
i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special,positive

i left my old pressure cooker \( a tefal made of steel \) in storage in another state and i was dying to have a new one i bought this because the price was great and the description seemed to make this set attractive and i m very glad i did both pots \( the large and the smaller \) fit the pressure lid so it s like having two pressure cookers instead of one one night i cooked lamb in the small pot and in 20 minutes i had a very nice and super tender meal and the next day i made beef broth with the large cooker so that i could freeze it and pull it out anytime i want it i m very satisfied with this product it looks great it s very efficient and it s very strong and durable the set also comes with a cooking book containing easy recipes of all kinds from main courses to desserts and even a table with cooking time for many items,positive
this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake the 5 quart was worth the money don t buy the 4 qt save the money and purchase the 5 you ll be glad that you did,positive
i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one,positive
i have a 3 1 2 year old boxer that barks cries whines and howls when i go to work all day i know i recorded it i went to petsmart and picked up this gadget brought it home and it the manual correct button she bolted she hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes it reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and i don t crate my dog when i m going to be away for more than 8 hours so if i m just running out for a few hours i stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if i m going to work i use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar my girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he s otherwise engaged but my dog hates it worth the price in my opinion best advice is to take it home and try it some dogs react to it others don t,positive
unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time with normal bread in before lowering the bread sticks almost 1 2 way out of the toaster making it very easy to remove hot toast to toast smaller items \( the plunger will go up even further to assist \) the slots are extra wide so although i have not used the sandwich cage accessory i can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage \( apparently a british idea and maybe something worth investigating \) i am doing normal toast on only setting 2 bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect \( bagel feature push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right \) the machine feels solid as if it will last a long time the cobalt blue color is more of a bluish purple in normal light but very attractive very happy with the machine \( the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping,positive

i own the graphite style of this set i was originally very happy with the purchase the set looked great didn t chip easily and was a great size after a year of use i ve come up with a list of problems the clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed the semi matte finish acquires a powdery almost bleached look to it after many washings \( says dishwasher safe guess that means the colors don t wash away immediately \) my biggest complaint we bought these because they were microwave safe i don t know what microwave safe means to most people but it means to me that i could put a plate bowl or cup in the microwave heat up the contents and then safely remove the object and use it in the case of the set i purchased it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode unfortunately in the case of the sango graphite set it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the \( plate bowl cup \) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the \( plate bowl cup \) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave they get very hot \( cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120f while cup surface is 170f \) i ve only broken 2 items from the set both times i dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned \( first time i thought it was a fluke second time i learned my lesson \) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave i emailed sango several times and received no response at all while i liked the set a lot initially i have been very disappointed over time with its quality i will never purchase another from sango again,negative

i bought this for my mother a year ago and i was recently looking for a vacuum myself so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing i asked her how she liked it she said she liked it and thought it worked well and loved how light it was \( she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis \) so needless to say i went out and purchased it trusting mother deartest s opinion i hate it i just moved out of my house and i had to clean \( vacuum \) every room in the house it took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy hoover vacuum to do the job one sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s just to pick up some damn crumbs also you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily after only vacuuming about half a room it will not suck up hair rather it gets tangled in the wheel and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never ever cleaned out hence making it harder and harder to pick things up \( not that it does to begin with \) it s loud time consuming and the biggest waste of money the only thing it has going for it is its weight which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway oh and i ve used this product once once one time of use pretty much was all it was worth if that i m taking it back and throwing it at them don t waste your money on this people,negative
i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still haven t received this i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now won t get it until june 30th costumer service is ridiculous i was told it would take 3 5 days that s why i ordered it don t get it if you need it within one yea,negative
this is a high quality pan with a nice heavy weight to it not at all flimsy i wanted to get one like my mom s and this turned out to be less expensive but a much better quality and heavier weight i bought 2 of these along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon s 4 for 3 promotion and it only came to about 30 that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality i would absolutely recommend these,positive
saw these canisters and fell in love with them couldn t wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn t fit properly another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off i was disppointed in the quality i wouldn t buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive,negative
i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles but mostly they ignored it when i got the battery and the bird started moving my two older cats weren t impressed but my youngest \( about 1 1 2 years \) went crazy it s pretty funny watching her with the toy she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird it s also entertaining when she s finished playing she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly which means she is hit in the backside by the bird naturally this starts the fight with the bird all over again i m pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well but even if it s just the kitten it s worth the money,positive
this is the most loathesome appliance i have ever owned i hate everything about it some genius put the power cord at the bottom of the unit so you have to hold the cord up all the time to keep from backing over it this may not be such a problem if the stupid self propelled function weren t constantly trying to shoot backward meaning i need both hands just to push the unit forward it s like i m dancing with my vacuum and we re fighting for the lead ridiculous i have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house and i wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster oh it also came with a free little red dd sweeper the handle of which broke the first time i tried to use it i don t know if dd came under new management or what but i will never buy one of their products again,negative
great coffee and a convenient size but the carafes keep breaking on me i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke i ordered a replacement and was extra careful when handling it \( especially when washing it \) i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke these things just seem to spontaneously combust the carafes are 12 a piece so it s not worth replacing again argh,negative
this unit is smaller than i was expecting it is 11 tall and 5 5 in diameter i have it in our small bathroom at the moment because it was too small to affect the humidity level in the 120 square foot room i had originally put it in \( i have a hygrometer in the room to measure its humidity and this unit did not affect the humidity level in 24 hours \) i doubt it is adequate for our tiny bathroom it seems like it might be adequate for a not too humid closet it says it removes 16oz a day at 86 degrees fahrenheit but whose house it 86 degrees in our humid bathroom it sucks up a mere third of an inch a day i guess it performs better in a warmer space,negative
these treats have been great for our large breed older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips they re also one of the few glucosamine treats that don t make him sick,positive
i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i didn t hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore,negative
i just received this set yesterday and haven t had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet \( i ll try to remember to update this review once i do \) but there were a few initial impressions i thought merited a review on their own the cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package instead the kit contained a small fold out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook \( i doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook or even that it sways many would be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit but its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase and is something you should know before you buy \) that having been said the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good i have no doubt whatsoever that they ll be wonderful functional additions to my kitchen the hard anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability i m impressed and i ll be back to say more once i actually use them to make pizzas,positive
the stool is excellent quality looks good and works well the surprise is the weight very heavy,positive
i bought this coffee maker because of its compact size but returned it a week later i found it very difficult to avoid spillage when pouring the water into the coffee maker and the coffee into a cup the problem was worse if making more than 4 cups another problem was the taste of the coffee i like my coffee full of flavor i have been using drip coffee makers for several years and think i know how to get the coffee just right but every carafe of coffee from this tasted weak and much too hot almost scalding,negative

we are using 2 love seat throws for an old l shaped sectional sofa it really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color the material quality is great for the price the only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping say about once a day the throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in built mechanisms to hold in place \( e g a velcro system straps etc \) so you have to put the throw over the sofa again neatly if you don t mind arranging the throw about once a day this will be a very inexpensive and great looking cover for your sofa,positive
this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image it broke the second week i had it spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor it s pure crap stay away,negative
it s weird the handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome emeril logo then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it s shape easily you d hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle but not here it s not a bad whisk for the price but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars buy something else,negative
i was going to buy the lello 45900 ariete espresso cappuccino maker because the price was so good but i waited over three months because it was not in stock so i looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price but after using it it s more than twice the machine i think on the amazon description it says the pump is a 16 bar pump but after checking reviews on different web sites i think amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites it says the a pump to be 17 5 bar pump that s even better and the other thing that i like was the fact that it had a cd that was not said on the description either i never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful shows and explains the basics from making espresso two frothing the milk cleaning tips and more very helpful so i made myself my first shot of espresso it was great nice little cream on top it just looked beautiful i didn t think it would work to good because i bought some pods and i wasn t sure how it would work works great taste great and easy to clean second day i made myself a latte again excellent third day i got adventurous i made myself my first cappuccino and again great put starbucks to shame the espresso i was using was the illy sucro espresso pods 906 naturally the espresso you use is actually more important than the machine i guess this one taste great about different type of syrups caramel vanilla hazelnuts irish cream the syrups brand was davinci so yes i am very satisfied with this machine and i guess i got lucky because this one was out of stock for a long time,positive
just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place paid 6 50 for item and 6 34 for shipping and was very displeased upset with quality of the item i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft,negative
we use this to serve ice water at meals it is so beautiful it holds a full 2 qts not much else to say about it it is a water pitcher after all it is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table we have two one for each end of the table,positive

i bought this unit a few years back worthless at best i wish someone even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units i called their customer service who said good luck as their best solution the problem is aluminum cools off too fast it will not retain heat i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake do they make them anymore ebay help,negative
my mother had a set of franciscan apple dinnerware as i was growing up though i never thought too much about what i was eating off of at the time later as a wife and mother myself i was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen we had just moved to appleton wi \( 16 years ago \) so i decided to use an apple theme w o even connecting the idea with my mom s dishes i was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the franciscan dishes over the years i ve collected innumerable apple items but my goal is to have a set of franciscan apple dishes of my own they do chip but they last forever and retain their color beautifully,positive
i bought these sheets 6 8 months back i have been using these sheets regularly even after many wash i don t see the sign of lint coming out this seems to be one of my great value for money very soft and cozy excellent for winter even after many wash there are no sign of lints excellent for the price,positive
not much to be said about this product just watch for a low price and then stock up,positive
it was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though i always kept it charged since this is the type of product you might take camping i don t recommend it because it s not reliable i used it once or sometimes twice a day no more so i really think it should have lasted longer,negative
i just tried this out for the first time and i was impressed it baked evenly and nicely best of all the cake came right out i simply sprayed it lightly with non stick spray and baked due the flexibility of this product you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability i will be buying more from this line,positive
i bought this blender based on the reviews here as well as its great looking design when i got the blender only one of those factors came through first thing i noticed both blender jars leaked badly after reseating the seal in the glass jar and tightening it as hard as possible the leak was slightly reduced the metal jar still poured out liquids from the base second thing i noticed this blender cannot make a good smoothie even after a couple minutes of blending there are chunks of ice and fruit which have been totally untouched by the blades \( regardless of how little ice is put in the smoothie \) for a blender of any price the delonghi does a poor job making smoothies for a blender that costs what the delonghi does this performance is totally unjustifiable but hey it does look really good,negative
my 82 year old aunt can now open a wine bottle because the vacu vin requires minimal physical strength the only i have found that is so easy to use except for bench models,positive
it is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels \) what you probably don t see on the picture well it stands on plastic so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding has really easy refill no mess no fuss and you can always see when you need to buy pepper i don t think there is better pepper grinder out there others i saw are certainly better looking artsy whatever but this one is the most useful,positive
when i ordered this product it had a 4 star average rating how that happened is beyond me were a zero star rating available this product wouldn t even deserve the string of uncolored stars i purchased it thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic freebie grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago after many refills that all plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the gears the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper so i order this one it s attractive low mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out and guess what i m still using the plastic worn out grinder this miu grinder was a total waste of money and i just can t bear to listen to it squeal when i attempt to use it its adjustement is loose enough that s not the problem what good s a lifetime warranty against wearing out if i m not going to use the grinder at all now i m stuck with it unless i want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order so basically i may could get a few bucks back which is probably what i ll do because this grinder isn t worth 2 cents i wouldn t even give the thing away maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person i ll certainly not purchase another one online if you like the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard buy this grinder buy a second one for your salt while you re at it you ll love em \( update 1 month later i tried to give this thing a chance and the god awful squealing is becoming less consistent which might be even worse as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high pitched jag every so often it s gotten quite worse however with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn from fine grind to quarter corn sized pieces in a few turns not recommended at all i might try switching it over to salt maybe it can handle that better,negative
i bought these because i was sick of creating foil shields on the pies i bake i love that these slip perfectly on and off however i ve found that since they re made of metal or aluminum they actually conduct heat and cause the crust of the pie to darken faster than the center which is exactly what i didn t want it to do that said i have to admit that while the edges of my pies look darker than the rest it hasn t come out burnt as it would if i were to bake the pie without any sort of shield i m planning on buying another brand s something made from silicone instead,negative
i bought this power mop for my daughter for christmas and it broke the first time she used it,negative

i purchased this toy for a friend s dog a while back the dog loved it he played with it non stop \( quack quack \) when he finally destroyed it though we were shocked inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag my friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items we did complain to the manufacturer who said they d look into it but i would still be wary of this toy i think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it s toys but doesn t rip them to shreds there is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe,negative
my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends his bedroom was decorated with thomas but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for 3 99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block out light because i opened package the other set i send back to amazon i do not recommend this product and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block out light,negative
the coat rack works wonderful for us we hang our robes \( tend to be thick and heavy \) before going into the hot tub it was very easy to assemble lightweight yet it holds the robesas one expects a coat rack to do i don t understand the reviews that indicated difficulty assembling or trouble with its stability none of that is the case for us,positive
it is thicker than other bed pads but not as thick as i expected quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on easy to put on the bed,positive

cuts like a samurai blade quality and doesn t need to steel as frequent as the henckels wusthof knives it has excellent weight for a medium sized hand however the handles get quite slippery when wet so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety also if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel don t because this global blade is much harder than the henckels wusthof blades a qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must or if you really like the steel design get the global steel which can cost quite a bit overall this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed just like a samurai would do to get use to his sword,positive
i received this popper as a gift and while it looks nice it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn nothing worked if i had the receipt it would already have been returned since i don t it is going in the garbage also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine stay away from this machine,negative

i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer,negative
this wok is heavy and unbalanced it can tip while on the element the long handle is thick and uncomfortable and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task the flat bottom isn t wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir frying if i wanted to saut i d have gotten a saut pan the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere you need lots of counter space as well this wok just isn t large enough for stir frying for more than two people,negative
i m a betta hobbist and i know about all the misconceptions that betta can live in just about anything and it is bogus this aquarium is way too small betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1 2x weekly atleast this is probably 1 2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills this also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just isn t good you can also buy large critter carriers \( 2 3 gallons \) for the same price or less it wouldn t be great but it d be a heck of a lot better,negative
the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove,negative
i recieved this rack for christmas and i love it it looks great and my 4 year old daughter likes to use it too the only thing i don t like is that it only holds 50 dvds and 2 racks look nice but any more than that is gonna look dumb i also like that the drawers pull out and sit on top for easy viewing,positive
the pan arrived on time and undamaged in the factory box the nonstick surface is slicker than the hardened titanium one used on scanpan and cleans easily the rotating vent on the glass lid is a nice feature my wife was skeptical at first but i ve caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently in fact it s become their favorite pan unlike a pure teflon finish this pan will brown the food nicely as far as durability goes well it s too early to tell but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product i like it,positive

i ve seen this particular clock at other web sites i decided to buy it from target com because the price was good and there is free shipping when i received the clock in only 3 days i was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed it arrived in perfect condition i inserted an aa battery only to wonder whether i had gotten a dud it didn t make any perceptible tick soon it was clear that the clock was working well and i hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and i love it i highly recommend this very quiet well made clock,positive
i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker but when it arrived it was just like brand new including all original packing perfect i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately but again it was quite strong in this regard and froze the mixtures perfectly admittedly doesn t make a huge amount but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it and it s way quieter than the old fashioned freezers also it was half the price of a new one buy it,positive
i did not buy the whole set my review is for an 8 fry pan it was one of those try it deals i do not like the grooves in the pan because after for instance frying an egg the grooves retain food and if you don t use a brush to scrub the grooves you ll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves i can t imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware yikes,negative
we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out when i saw the refurbished for 20 00 i thought it was a great deal it would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn t leak it didn t come with seals or with the water purifier i tried everything including new seals \( that i bought separately \) eventually we just went out and purchased a new one because we still like the model,negative
alas this had no discernable effect on my cats however the product arrived in good time and in good shape,negative
my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it,negative
this canister vac might be ok for very light duty but don t expect it to handle any real housecleaning the filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot if i had it to do over again i would not purchase this vac i would save up and buy a better canister vacuum,negative
this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole soup tureen handles are sturdy but short so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder but easy to grip with bare hands because of this feature you may decide to use this as a serving dish only good for a large group rather than due to large capacity we are a family of 2 so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox,positive
i bought this board along with another brand this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink it also warped within one month of my purchasing it the wood has also splintered not my idea of a good cutting board i would not recommend it to my friends nor would i purchase it as a gift,negative
this whisk is very nice and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand one thing i hadn t foreseen however is actually pretty obvious the silicone doesn t slide very well along most surfaces so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction it is exactly as advertised though and i am very happy to have it,positive
many of you reading these reviews may be wondering how this compares to similar items made of cast iron i can tell you that while it obviously isn t cast iron and for that reason alone many will say it is inferior it is still an excellent griddle the bottom is very heavy and it conducts heat well it fits perfectly over 2 burners on one side of my gas stove i ve cooked several sandwiches at once on it as well as pancakes and some eggs and the heat seems to distribute very evenly i was very impressed with this aspect of the griddle as cast iron is known for its even heating and i was wondering how an aluminum griddle would hold up it definitely does a fine job the bonus of course is the nonstick surface and it s a good one not some chintzy teflon coating good quality construction the handles are solid and it doesn t feel cheap at all when you hold it take care of this griddle \( make sure it doesn t get scratched \) and it will take care of you,positive
i feel rich sleeping in these sheets they are quite wrinkley but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i m sure money well spent,positive

absolutely fab shiny bright stainless steel matches frieling french press and any other stainless tableware countertop items perfectly just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so of course the sugar bowl holds plenty note you ll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go around at a table seating 4 6 coffee lovers overall these are just very sturdy solid clean up beautifully and very easily and by the way the sugar spoon included with the lid covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar and sets inside the little notched area of the lower bowl so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered on at the same time a really simple yet european engineered well thought out design quality i fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me down although it s a l o o o ng time until i ll be distributing my assets make sure to buy the matching frieling french press it s just incredible also heirloom quality give yourself the gift of european quality coffeeware it s one of life s simple yet indispensible indulgences ps the frieling french coffee press w this matching sugar creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too,positive
not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful they also bake the most perfect pies i have ever put together the crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky i use martha s pate brisee recipe but with these pans it is foolproof i have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches wonderful,positive
i haven t used this for herbs but i have used it for onions and garlic and like the other reviewers found it very handy for quick and tear free mincing it s a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect i love that it s only 3 small parts \( 4 if you count the rubber blade \) that all fit easily into the dishwasher \( top rack \),positive
i bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great that is until it started leaking about 4 months after i bought it giving the benefit of the doubt and thinking the leak was a qa issue rather than a design issue i managed to exchange it for the exact same model well it s been 4 months since i got the new one and this morning what did i notice yup a leak the tank was full yesterday and this morning it s 2 3 s full with a pool of water on the table that holds it luckily no damage was done to the floor either time i understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time well then it s just a cruddy product stay away from this aquarium,negative

we just purchased ours this past week and we love it we ve had glass coffee makers before and we used to waste so much coffee because it sat on the burner and burnt now we throw away nothing sometimes we wake up the next morning and there is still a half a pot left a good 1 minute zap in the microwave and it tastes just as good as it did when it was first brewed this is our second thermal coffee maker and we have found that unless you remove the coffee filter holder after each use and rinse it it will leak all over coffee grounds get stuck in the little holes where the coffee comes out and into the thermal pot also to stop the leak problem be careful when putting in coffee grounds make sure none get past it im a little surprised at the negatives reviews on this product its an in expensive coffee maker and it does the job very well the over flowing of coffee and the leakage problem is due to improper housekeeping we havent had any problems with this,positive
if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment this isn t for you the radio is hard to use since it doesn t have any indication of what frequency you are on and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static the pedometer function is marginal at best but its what you would expect for 15,negative
this griddle performed very poorly and i will not be keeping it it cooked very unevenly \( the left side of a 4 inch pancake was almost burned while the right side was practically raw \) and the pancakes stuck even though it is supposed to be preseasoned \( it s cast iron \) and i heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil it also did not sit securely on my gas stove due to the grill ridges on the other side it rocks back and forth slightly even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass because i use my griddle almost every weekend i am considering the broil king ultra large electric giddle which got cook s illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests,negative
this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes i ve owned larger crockpots for a couple decades \( currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family size meals \) but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space aren t at all useful for heating or re heating small quantities this little crockpot however is perfect for heating or re heating 2 4 servings of soup or stew i originally bought it however because it is absolutely perfect for making hot cereal on cold mornings especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop such as steel cut oatmeal \( try the nutty goodness of traditional steel cut oatmeal once \( also available here at amazon \) you re unlikely ever to return to instant or quick cook oatmeal again \) there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you from mid october to late march virtually every night i prepare my entire family s hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave other uses we ve discovered it s perfect for making serving hot mulled cider keeping hot dips gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet as a substitute fondue pot for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient \( how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup \) for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker especially if used in conjunction with rival s inexpensive sp100 pdq smart part module \( also sold on amazon as of the date of this review \) which provides the same timed cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival s larger more expensive crockpots the energy used is minimal too only 80 watts the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher as does the lid for very convenient clean up,positive
it s a wonderful cutting board \( also available at the store \) i m a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something i ve found very useful any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic this one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks the 9 99 price tag isn t bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well that and it just looks great in the kitchen i use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and wouldn t go without them don t listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a 14 x 17 solid granite cutting board for ten bucks not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives fyi to the moron amp quot protect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight tough polyethylene cutting boards amp quot yah nothing at all dimwit,positive

the unit features automatic shut off when water is low by using a proximity switch via a float with a magnet in it it has a shut off by setting humidity level and a shut off by count down timer after a few weeks of use the unit started leaking and you can t even tell where the leak is coming from the pads do not prevent mineral build up on the hot plate i am getting brownish deposits which i believe to be rust the only way to remove it is with white vinegar and old toothbrush which i had to bend into an l shape in order to get at and clean the stainless steel hotplate which boils the water i was happy with the unit and preferred it over an ultrasonic unit i had until it start leaking,negative
the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisserie the grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals,positive

i bought this product on my mom s suggestion because she was impressed with the suction power not only did the suction power fade over the first few months of ownership but within 6 months the vacuum was completely broken i called in to customer service because it was still under warranty and they were anything but helpful they sent me to a small shop 45 minutes away to have it fixed which took over a month they even lost my paperwork one month later it broke again and customer service suggested i take it out in my backyard take the vacuum apart and blow the small holes with an air compressor to clean it out for 400 this is ridiculous i want my 100 vacuum back,negative
wow what a fine example of terrible engineering the only control is a knob that ranges from off to super to set the thermostat you turn the knob to the super setting when the room reaches a comfortable level you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off this is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp at this setting the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp this design sets the stage for a frustrating user experience by design you must turn the thermostat to the highest setting then wait for the room to heat up before fiddling with the knob until the unit clicks off at which point you end up turning it up a bit until it clicks on \( if it does \) its like trying to adjust your home s thermostat in the dark just show me where to set the dial for 68 degrees and let me get on with my day when the heater is working as designed it turns on for 30 60 seconds turns off for 10 90 seconds then repeats the cycle relentlessly and unpredictably until you unplug it let it cool box it back up and send it back i want a refund reimbursement for lost productivity and an ice cream sandwich,negative

having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan as the tittle says pay the 3 4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead i m using the preseasoned more because it is just ready keep in mind its large and heavy careful in your sink coming from stainless steel and converted over to calphalon \( mostly bought all pieces from amazon com \) if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me heat kills everything if you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water salt scrubbing and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with but we all pay for convience and these pans i use mostly to sear meat with a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives get the preseasoned,positive
i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well can t win them all,negative

i really loved the look of the lamp and it went perfectly in my living room for a reading light next to my favorite chair two days after i bought it it broke at the place where it screws together on the pole i returned it and actually considered getting another one just because i liked the looks of it so well but ended up just getting a refund i was pretty disappointed and am still looking for a lamp to replace it,negative

we love these glasses we have had the reidel glasses like these many times they break so easily and can t go in the dishwasher these glasses are so much more utilitarian we use them as our everyday glasses not just for wine they look great feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher and cost so much less we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions they are more refined but i got so tired of that ultra thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass i strongly recommend the libbey glasses you will like it like like it on your table table table,positive
my friend was ecstatic when she opened up this present from me at the holidays she claims it s the best spice rack very durable stylish and doesn t take up too much space on the kitchen counter to prove her point she went and bought fresh spices and made her own personalized spice rack definitely was a hit,negative
this is a massive skillet be warned it s heavy but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan it s preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great i would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down,positive

after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one it has been great and i couldn t ask for anything better or more easy to use i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross odors or tastes my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated cleanup is easy also after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be i would recommend this with no caveats,positive

i purchased this fry pan in june of this year and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all clad but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer and a small fraction of the cost after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food ick i love the uncoated all clad but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future,negative

i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more francis francis being my first this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as espresso machines but marginally if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important focusing on the machine for a moment you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed,negative
i have two cats both less than 5 months old i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that s way over priced my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic save your money and use it on something more useful,negative

i found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate it s a soft light \( almost seems like a natural spectrum \) and is very directed at the page the clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover and the neck is flexible as needed so functionally it gets a solid a but i wasn t happy that it takes nonstandard batteries \( two of those round watch calculator batteries \) replacing them is a hassle \( though inexpensive \) because i have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before i leave and i have to find them in a store with an electronic department i wish this light took aaa or something the light does include batteries so you won t need to worry until you run out for me that was probably around 20 hours or so,positive
i received this as a christmas gift i ve used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you re flying it s the best way i ve ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere,positive
i ve lusted after a super auto for years when i finally decided to get one i did a fare amount of investigating the gaggia titanium had the best spec s for the price and good reviews i decided to spend the extra money for the stainless unit i haven t seen the painted plastic model so i can t comment on the appearance i do think the stainless looks great you can find reviews of the non stainless here on amazon and other than the outside appearance the device is the same i ve only had the unit for a few days but so far i m very happy to the negatives first the manual is awful it s not just the italian to english translation the text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great i spent a fair amount of time making sure i understood how to setup and use the unit i m pretty technically savvy and in the end i figured it all out but don t rush into using this product until you ve figured out how to set it up clean it and adjust all the settings \( there are many \) the only issue i ve had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it s empty when it s not open the lid \( which could be a bit better designed \) and stir and it works could be the beans i m using not sure it s an intermittent issue the good stuff once you figure out the coffee strength and grind the gaggia makes a delicious cup i wish the brew were a tad hotter \( i have it set to max \) but using the cup warmer helps no issues making froth with the wand much better than the older manual machine i had you can t put a huge mug under the unit \( the max size is 4 5 inches \) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed you can set the unit for the amount of brew however i found that clicking the large coffee button twice the unit thinks it s making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug it s much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size you get a nice foam on top and as i said the coffee is outstanding i love the clean up \( or lack of \) compared to the drip maker i had \( a bodum vacuum unit \) i still have that unit should i need to make a lot of coffee for company but for the two mugs i drink in the morning the gaggia easily replaces this unit and there s far less cleanup the grinds sit in a canister and after a few days you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse so you can use this gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you re making a cup or two what i love is just pressing a button twice \( for two large coffees \) and walking away from the unit a minute later a great cup of joe it truly is super automatic i have the unit set for energy savor whereby it s in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after i use it i only drink in the morning however if you decide to wake it up it heats up in about 2 minutes it also does a rinse cycle so i keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water there is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days there s also a full rinse cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir it s a menu item so don t select it unless you really want to do this \( takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire \) yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks i m very happy update the issue with the grinder was the beans \( too oily \) i called the ny office and got someone in tech support in minutes she knew her product sure enough the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area,positive
the only european characteristic of this cup is it s price the picture is deceiving this thing is tiny i could only put three of my fingers through it s ear i am definitely returning it to amazon in my mind it s worth 5 bucks and is more of a for a kid than an adult,negative

i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon it s a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i didn t quite understand at the time i bought it was that it s also just one big piece of fabric no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place kind of disappointing but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila a great looking couch appeared so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money,positive
i was looking for a timer that had a loud ringer i could hear from another room while cleaning so i could check on what i m cooking this one just didn t do that for me i notice the sound it sends out is not always the same sometimes it is a bit louder then other times to me that does not do me much good i cannot depent on it all the time so now i just use it to keep near me when i m at the computer but i do notice more of the sound comes out of the back but then you can t see how much time you have left if you turn it backwards the ringer goes for 1 min this does not count backward the numbers and buttons are large which is probably the reason i bought this timer the two magnets are not very big and does not stay on my frig very good when its on my frig and i start to press the buttons it starts moving all over price wise this is probably a good buy depending on what you want to use it for i bought another timer that the ringer is louder but the buttons and are very small guess you cannot have it all no matter at what the price is,negative
works good except for with the cappicuion pods they dont brew throughly but makes great coffee,negative

unless you re planning on washing dinner plates only this dish rack is not for you smaller plates \( or bowls for that matter \) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips \( about 1 8 inch \) so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open \( 3 1 4 inches \) anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor the utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom i bought this thinking that since polder has a good name it would be a good product i was wrong and polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design,negative
very well made a quality item works just as described in booklet,positive
we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model,negative

this waterer is a great concept but does have some drawbacks for starters one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it the other dog is just fine with it but then again he s deaf so the gurgle doesn t bother him lol the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls it gets dirty so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl but it s a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off clean the bowl and but the jug back on so if your dog isn t afraid of the noise it makes and you don t mind the extra hassle cleaning it it s great otherwise just get a large bowl that s what i ended up having to do,negative
ice bucket is smaller than i expected otherwise a very good product,positive
i bought this for my mother in law at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee,negative

we have owned other hoover steam cleaners they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet we bought the hoover f5914 900 based on the reviews i was confident that it wouldn t leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack i couldn t keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job ok our hoover came my husband put it together and it leaked all over i then re read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them by then we had already taken it to the repair center after a week they had not touched it my husband picked the machine up and brought it home we decided to start from square one and put it together again he did following the directions to the letter lo and behold no leaks yeah my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman so the moral to this story is always read the directions first,positive

i bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box first the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back there was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance finally it is just not good looking at all extremely cheap in appearance it did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to amazon i went with the bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers evidently another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances do not buy this item get the braun kf550 bk aromadeluxe instead,negative
the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top i was sent new doors but they didn t fit frustrated i accepted the promised 175 00 off to keep the doors knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later i have yet to receive this refund the delivery was also a major problem there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone so i tipped him to bring it in for me i will never buy anything from this company again,negative
okay i bought for the price and it is effective enough but it is very clumsy and unergonomic so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer the main problems are balance of weight and the switch first the switch because it is a cheap push in button which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on you lose optimum control quickly the handle is badly placed for this as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it but you can t hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting in addition keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife but because the button sinks deep into the handle so your thumb is inside the handle as you re trying to hold and control the knife quick cramp moreover as you re pushing it in if the food you re cutting is moist \( like a turkey \) juices may run onto the handle your thumb and into the hole into which you re pressing the button not safe a couple times i ve wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock either way it wasn t good then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good look at the huge bulk of the motor and then look at where the handle is located and how it is designed there s no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is add in the need to be depressing the power button as you re holding it awkwardly and 2 stars for effectiveness minus 3 for bad functional design,negative

when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b c the materials are light weight but i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic it was just so easy and looked so good i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer unlike other reviewers i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts,positive
product was fine except that it isn t microwaveable at the time of purchase it claimed to be microwaveable the handle has a screw in it i purchased it specifically for use in a microwave,negative
i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel let s be realistic these knives are cheap they re thin and they re not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that s what you re getting i hand washed these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and didn t hear back i finally got their address \( from the post office \) and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them \( with 15 minute wait times for each call \) to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i m going to finish my sentence so their rep would stop talking they won t refund my money in fact they won t refund anyone s money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they ll send me another set of soon to be rusty knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can,negative

i m terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute doesn t hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself,negative
i was impressed with all the pieces liked the pots with short handles but when washing the lids the handles on top get full of water and have to be sat up for water to drain out s l o w l e y before putting them away also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you re cooking but what do you want for 30 bucks,negative

unlike many people it seems i ve never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker it s still sturdy for me after about 8 uses however the fact that i ve owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself this waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles i ve never been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles i ve had in restaurants after trying over half a dozen different recipes i realized that it wasn t my ingredients it was the waffle maker this waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be crispy on the outside chewy and moist on the outside instead no matter what recipe i used or how long i cooked the waffles for i would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness \( if they had any to begin with \) within moments of leaving the waffle maker the model doesn t burn the waffles the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking and overall the waffle maker is nice looking but that s all it has going for it i ve learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances you get what you pay for,negative

i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation motor power and style i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet,negative
after about 10 days from date of purchase only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle i would have to push the on button get another 2 cups after 5 or 6 tries i would finally get all 8 cups through the design is bad for left handed people it s very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate the lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and i would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid overall not a good design i got my money back and am bought a hamilton beach brewstation which i think is a great coffemaker,negative
i ve changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years i cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself that said i still have reasonable water pressure and here s the amazing thing my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it who knew that for all my life it was the water not my hair my skin is not as dried out if i could work out the little glitches it would be perfect i own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it s fab for the price,positive

my girlfriend and i recently bought two ultrasonic humidfiers this machine and an air o swiss 7135 the venta worked well when it worked however it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason you could jiggle the thing and it would go on and off we finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base the water wasn t flowing properly and the machine stopped \( as it should \) because there was no water took it back to the hardware store where we bought it and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem it may be number 1 in germany but it gets only 1 star here,negative

cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you ll have bases covered,positive

i was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for xmas however if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs i won t be using it often the literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre seasoned and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat on the first try i had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots though i was able to get it to release with a pancake turner the scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off even with soaking for awhile on the second try i oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread so as to not have any bare spots i still had sticking ditto for clean up this thing weighs a ton too it is awkward to transfer off the burner the instructions warn lift do not slide on a glass top stove i think i ll continue to use my non stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press that always works great,negative
the price was excellent ordering was quick and easy delivery was prompt the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle,positive

moved into a new home wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets decided to try a bagless model this thing is a total waste of money it has barely any suction whatsoever especially when trying to use the hose so for now after running this thing i have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just couldn t suck up it s ridiculous it s a brand new vacuum i have never had to do this with any other vacuum i had my husband make sure it was working right and it is it just has a very weak suction this thing is going back to the store and i am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum don t waste your money also i have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors \( well they all pretty much do that job but for some reason this has a bare floor setting whoop de do \) it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor nor can it suck up a cobweb don t buy,negative

i bought this toaster after reading several reviews finding a reasonable price and liking the look of it i was looking to upgrade since my old toaster \( a toastmaster \) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown i am seriously disappointed with this toaster i put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts and that half usually ends up burnt the slots are slanted forward and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster it is the upper portion that over toasts and the lower portion comes out essentially raw though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so and had to go through two cycles it still toasted better then this t fal i bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times i am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand hope this helps,negative
i must admit i m really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is it s still too early as i ve only had it for a month or so and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it s been given we have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with and so far there has been no problem i highly recommend this little guy and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place one suggestion though wonder how long it ll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model that way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode,positive

the kitchen odors were getting very bad we realized that the filter had never been changed it is an old recirculating system over the stove finding filters is for the birds filters are all listed by a serial or code number i think the psychology is that you use only the filter from the original manufacturer after looking at many different types of filters these seemed to be cutable is that a word we did not need to cut they fit into the nutone range hood perfectly our nutone hood is so old that we could not find anything listed on the nutone site so these fit the house odor while cooking is diminished what is not clear is how often they should be replaced obviously when the smell gets worse but i have no idea if 6 months or 6 years will buy more cheaper than a new hood,positive
the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier it works really well,positive
this shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble this hold alot of shoes and spins really nice i have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11 s fit just fine this shoe rack is perfect i highly reccomend it,positive
this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before it also heats very evenly the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem,positive
the best buy i have ever found on 1000 count sheets they are excellent quality,positive
i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it s also compact i gained a little more counter space,positive
this product is perfect for keeping pots and pans from scratching our new stainless steel sink rubber feet are great for protecting the sink as well,positive
i ll admit i had to learn how to use this turner because of its shape but now i realize that it s far better than any spatula i ve ever had i can actually flip a burger now \( something i could never do before \) i ve got to check out more emerilware you will not be disappointed this spatula is definitely worth it,positive
first one that i have purchased and it is extremely wonderful in the weight content as well as keeping us warm without feeling smothere,positive
i think i m a little crazy for buying this i just had to find out if the copper core was really better than an aluminum one it is but not by that much you can buy a pan from cuisinart s multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price that being said this thing is very well designed the rolled lip is useful for pouring the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there \( a problem with most pans \) the handle stays cool and is well designed overall this is the best 2 quart saute pan money can buy is it worth it that s up to you,positive
functionally this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner it is not attractive to look at however my walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish the varnish is very high gloss and the knobs are low grade mismatched junk i believe the build is solid but only time will tell final word pay the extra money for a hand crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally this just isn t worth 300,negative
i took a chance on ordering these and i m glad i did they are heavy duty i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it s nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware i ve also used these in a convection oven and them seem to work really great i picked the sapphire color and they are very attractive on the table as well,positive
i can t believe i spent good money on this vacuum i ve had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems why it won t vacuum without pushing it with all my might why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children why the filter won t stay in place and why it smells like burned rubber every time am forced to use it i have replaced every filter and belt now i am going to throw it away i d gladly give it to charity but i can t in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim,negative

i am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs amazon s listing says this innotek trainer comes with a lifetime warranty i ve read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars so i decided to review the owner s manual to learn more about the warranty the last page has a section entitled lifetime limited warranty which states innotek brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase the lifetime warranty apparently expires after one year further on it says the company offers several product exchange options during the warranty period costs are dependent on the processing time this suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year lifetime warranty the next paragraph says after one year from date of original retail purchase we will repair replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate based on the component what will these repairs cost this leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from innotek what if anything is warranted for a lifetime if the lifetime warranty is really only for one year why call it lifetime and finally what will repairs cost both during warranty under their product exchange options and afterwards under their component based fixed rate my specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery the manual does not indicate that this battery is user replaceable does this mean the user will have to send the collar to innotek to replace the battery and if so what will it cost i have contacted innotek through their website and will report back if i get a response until i do i ve got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty can anyone comment on warranty claims to innotek,negative

i ve used this for indian food and it worked really well you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala btw i own other anolon advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup re the squishy handle if you have gripping problems as many middle age to older cooks do this helps you don t listen to the young self involved and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature,positive
i like the idea of this bundt pan i made 3 batches of chocolate truffles on it the recipe that comes with the pan is awesome however i have yet to figure out how to get the chocolates out easily the first time i used a non stick spray \( not vegetable oil \) i thought that might be my problem because the company recommends vegetable oil on the next two batches i poured vegetable oil in the little holes and spread it around using a pastry brush again i had to fight to get the chocolates out i kid you not my husband pounded on the pan with a big rubber mallet to get the chocolates to come out i must be doing something wrong i will call customer service tomorrow but if there is a trick to this they should have told you on the instructions on how to make the truffles other than that the chocolates turned out beautifully and i will use this pan again even if i have to call my husband to help me out with his rubber mallet,positive
this knife is great for hard cheeses i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily but if you only use it for cheese it should stay sharp for a long time this is another beautiful global knife,positive

i purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep i have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans my son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus saying he hasn t slept this good in a long time the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and i too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom very sturdy steel construction easy assembly of the legs 3 speeds top speed is out of this world almost like a wind storm me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house what a riot i highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation sleep aid and some silly fun,positive
i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo they appeared to be very sharp however i did not like these knives for the following reasons 1 \) i dont care much for the cheap plastic like orange handles 2 \) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap furi implies that these knives are made in germany however they are cheaply made in china now generally i dont care that much everything is now made in china anyways but when i am paying so much money for a product i was hoping it was made in germany or usa 3 \) the case is even more cheaply made personally i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives,negative
i was very hesitant to spend close to 160 on a single fry pan but i had heard so many good things about all clad and thought it would be a wise investment for the first 6 months the pan was great i loved the large size and used it often i was just about ready to invest in an entire set of all clad cookware when my pan warped i was using it on an electric stove as usual and the pan just simply warped i was thoroughly disappointed that a 160 pan would warp during normal use i won t be spending this kind of money again follow up i contacted all clad regarding the warped pan they had me send it in for evaluation and yesterday a brand new one showed up at my door i m impressed at their customer service and the fact that they stand behind their product,negative

the concept here is good no tools needed to install the product itself is well made but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down,negative
unfortunately there is no option for 0 star i had the same problem as lana from nc i ordered the product and when i opened the box i found that i received only the bottom piece when i asked if the remaining pieces could be shipped i was told that partial products are not shipped and that i would have to get an entirely new order fine other than i have to go through the hassle of waiting in line at the post office to return the wrong one except if they don t ship partial products then why did i receive a partial product to begin with i received the second mind you the replacement order and the same exact thing happened i received only the bottom piece so now i have to shlep both packages to the post office and waste my time for their error i suggest doing a search of metrokane cocktail shaker and you will find a couple other sites selling the same product one site even has 2 different sizes if anyone is looking for a smaller shaker,negative

this little clock measures 2 25 x 2 25 x 1 25 inches \( 5 5 x 5 5 x 3 3 cm \) there s one simple knob to set the time and alarm and the knob is easy to manipulate even without tiny fingers little glow in the dark accents on the hands help with night vision though they are not very bright to turn the alarm on just pop up the gray lever on the top smack it to shut the alarm off \( you could press it gently but it did just wake you up right \) there is no snooze feature but for 5 it s a great value as a travel alarm in case you nap in your car or as a backup should your primary alarm clock fail you you just need to add your own aa battery to get it running,positive

at first i thought this was a great product if you only make cheese fondue it is great the pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe the problem i ve had with mine is that it doesn t get beyond about 320 degrees the dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up it only got up to 323 degrees and wouldn t go any further so if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it won t do the job well i know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break away cord but this is ridiculous touch the darn thing and the cord falls free very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue people kept telling me that the cheese was getting hard because the cord had fallen off again next time i d get a pot that had a thermometer built in don t rely on the heat setting dial,negative

within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off this is not the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect this is my third \( and final \) bread machine the first two were breadman ultimates i should note that i make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average pretty much every morning the first breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail this was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time \( water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond \) i bought an new breadman ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems this time i took extremely good care of the pan \( letting it cool down no soaking \) because it s clearly the weak link in the system within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed making the machine useless currently it doesn t seem very easy \( or even possible \) to buy a replacement pan for the breadman at this point i was done with the breadman much as i didn t want to spring for the extra money for the zojirushi and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn t work the same in the new machine i didn t see an alternative and got one within 3 weeks the teflon in the zoji pan formed two blisters one is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact i have been extremely careful with the pan i wait for it to cool and then remove the baked on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers i don t let it soak at all this is clearly a manufacturing defect i have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the breadman ultimate 1 \) the top of the bread rarely gets brown i ve added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much 2 \) i don t understand what the crust control option does it doesn t seem to increase baking time which it does on the breadman so it doesn t make much sense 3 \) the programmability is very weak on the breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs 4 \) the programmability options are very limited you can t control the knockdown time between risings you can t add risings to the default three they do give you a lot of time control on the risings you can t separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle it s all one cycle when you turn off the preheat cycle this only affects the built in programs and not the custom ones and worst of all you can t bake for more than 70 minutes this is utterly ridiculous i m sure this is a safety feature but it means you can t correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth this is almost a killer limitation in my opinion for those other reviewers that are having issues with rising i ve determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount type and quality of yeast if you exactly follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast it should work okay this means you must use rapid rise yeast with the quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs even using fleischmann s instead of red star made a difference the breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations at this point i m done with bread machines they are a failed technology in fact teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology all you have to do is search for teflon \( polytetrafluoroethylene \) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance the manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination a direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees \( eg frying pans \) perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread i ve thought about this but there s no way to make a bread machine without teflon going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon there is just no other viable solution i love making bread every day and i m going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean i have to give up on this technology it s back to the occasional hand made loaf it s the only rational and healthy solution,negative

i bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday i m sure she s going to enjoy using it i had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing it was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied now i just have to get one for myself well my birthday is coming up in february,positive
just what i was looking for it is an odd sized cover that is hard to find great quality also,positive
nice compact size can be moved easily does freshen the air in the room noticeably on whisper setting is almost silent on turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life maybe would sleeping does shoot out air but does not blow with any force over time like a day all the air in our 20 x20 living area changes did have a noticeable plastic like new odor the first few days of use which wore off haven t had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks but it would be easy to clean,positive

my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we don t have to worry about the bottom falling out the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well,positive
i internet shopped for a week reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast easy job ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal the pitcher is thick solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 yes just 2 speeds i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous,positive
we have finished our basement and have a home theater room which is on the cool side we bought this heater to warm up the room and it works great,positive
hey i wasn t expecting much but seriously these are a pretty bad i bought two of these for my office the plastic shade comes all dented and looks so cheap the stupid pieces don t fit together right and so if you move it you have to pick it up from the base or it falls apart and the switch gets stuck pretty much all the time so that it s really hard to turn it i m the kind of person who enjoys fixing things so i ve taken it apart and tried to fix it and its still rotten the second lamp is just completely broken now after only 6 weeks save your money i m back on amazon looking for new lamps actually,negative
it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid while it lasted it worked fine,negative
a little disappointing we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we ve had for umpteen years and still works like new we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced we ve only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it,positive

if you re looking for a car harness that will keep your dog safe in an accident keep looking this harness might work to prevent your dog from bouncing around the car and possibly distracting the driver \( although i m not even confident it would hold up for that use with a big strong dog \) but i seriously doubt it would hold up even in a mild collision the dog is held in place using a few plastic buckles snaps which are not even very strong looking i have seen stronger snaps on regular dog collars plastic snaps like these would not hold up to the forces created in a collision if you want a safety harness that will protect your dog in an accident look for one that has actually been tested rated similar to human car safety devices,negative

amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered we hoped this one would be an exception it was but only in that it may be the poorest of them all ours buzzed loudly whenever in use never had a toaster buzz before we toast bread at least twice a day and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible it has no bagel setting \( which toasts the cut side more than the crust side \) so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast what s more it toasts completely unevenly one corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned and it s really annoying when a 4 slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently as far as looks go de longhi did just as bad a job the photos look cool but the crumb tray this unit sits upon is actually wider than the unit itself so there is a big uneven gap at the seam it s the lower line you see in the photos but they make it look real nice for that what you don t see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several mm from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown this makes it look broken like two pieces of something that no longer fit together if de longhi had spent even a second thinking about this they would have done the opposite the bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look \( we even went to a store yes a real store to confirm that they are all like this and they are \) also the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element there are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn t scratch the metal surface of the toaster however two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping and though they slipped right back in all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out \( only friction holds them in \) and you will loose them very quickly especially if you ever wash the rack we re happy to pay extra for a quality item even a toaster but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment final advice stick to the 20 toasters with functions such as bagel defrost and dual controls if it s ugly keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it this one looks broken performs poorly and costs a lot of money if you do buy this model maybe you ll get ours we returned it,negative

we travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we re sleeping the materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence the main body is plastic the metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door the serrations on the bar are not deep so don t promise much strength while none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in this one while prettily designed is overly expensive and unimpressive we re going to try a few others by the way in returning this item which we consider unsatisfactory amazon will charge us doubly the cost to return the item to amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our super saver shipping the end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer,negative
this is a very good product it is exactly as it is pictured and described clear insulated unbreakable and does not leave a ring on your table the company is very quick shipping along with great follow up and follow through a fine product and i will be ordering more,positive
we bought four sets of the victoria collection 600 thread count queen size the fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed it seems like that were made for a full size not queen size list this as a reject we are very very disappointed,negative
yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size \( but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact \) i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it,positive
i ordered the 45 piece place setting it had to be the quickest turn around i have ever come across ordered on a thursday had it on a monday everything was in perfect condition i am so pleased with amazon and the way they do business i will buy from them again the dishes are beautiful i couldn t be happier thank you,positive
we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won t work unfortunately because it s rigid it slides up a dog s neck very easily i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can t slide even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position a shrug a shake or simply walking a few steps is all it takes this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs is not going to work it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems the dog now has another negative association to the person consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying f quall,negative

i bought 4 of these light sets after seeing them in real simple magazine i thought they looked and seemed to be a perfect option for my kitchen wrong after only 15 minutes my brand new batteries \( 4 aa \) seemed to fade and within an hour dead i thought this is a mistake and bought new batteries again only to be upset when the same thing happened i called the manufacture about getting the adapter 4 8v it requires only to be told they do not sell to the public and i would have to track it down at radio shack etc well i have had no luck on that yet lots of 4 5v but no 4 8v i wish i could send these back they were a complete waste and if i ever find the proper adapters i will certainly use them but that defeats the purpose of me choosing wireless lighting doesn t it,negative
i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product and the euro pro was bad decision the product wouldn t even turn on much less work the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped the euro pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality boy was i wrong if you re purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro pro too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas a real disappointmen,negative
one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i d much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there s no washing machine that s also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i didn t hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it s difficult to push and feels like it s gripping to the floor it doesn t fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it s big fat part vacuum head and when you re finished it s a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you re supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you ve finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i don t review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i m hoping that they will one day,negative
my wife got this cuisinart classic toaster oven as a wedding gift we liked the appearance and had it on our registry we used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well toast was perfect and the oven cooked nice and hot we broiled meats and made all kind of things in it we found it hard to clean we would take the baking pan and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter i glued it back on with super glue it broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so i had to fix this plastic foot a few times then another problem arose the toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start so to make toast we just used the un timed bake function but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast still we lived with it then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working so it does not bake i think i knew this was going to happen because i would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever i turned the dial to bake for a while so therefore i think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last i would have expected better quality considering how long we have been making toaster ovens i think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls so like other reviews say it does cook well and evenly but it is hard to clean and does not last if i were to have rated the product before the problems started i would have given it 4 stars i wish that amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products we are now looking into t fall convection toaster oven but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts since writing my review above i tried to fix my oven to no avail but i have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke my recommendations are as follows since i know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this classic model product can over time get dirty and stop working i recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops rice cookers deep fryers pressure cookers or kitchen sinks especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease i recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location this might make the unit last longer the newer cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem i had or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways maybe 1 5 years is average life or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products from the reviews and my observations above i think the krups models and the improved cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me,negative
this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year,negative

this is a great sweeper but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery we bought one a couple of years ago from sears with a sears replacement warranty since then we have replaced it five times \( we really got our money s worth from the warranty at least \) it s getting to be a joke one day \( usually 2 3 months after we bring home the new one \) the rotor just stops turning and that s all she wrote next time we will purchase a different sweeper warranty or not,negative
i bought this for my husband s birthday b c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there carafes that leak coffeemakers that don t keep the right temperature etc this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5 star restaurant in fact they probably use a bunn the design is utilitarian not decoration and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee,positive

i am sure there is a lesson in my experience i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt pepper did not go where i wanted it i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube i am sad to say that i again found it s performance to be a big disappointment,negative
i just bought 2 of these tables to use as nightstands i have a very high bed and thought they would be too short and too small but they are perfect i love the extra storage at the bottom and the little drawer is very useful as well assembly took no time at all and the tables turned out extremely sturdy i am very pleased,positive
i must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan s nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after i began using it i m not talking about scratches which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning my pan began pock all over even up the sides where i rarely touch them i hung on to this pan for 3 years simply because i could not bear to part with it for the expense but eventually i had to treat it like my other all clad pans \( which i love \) and use full amounts of oil to cook it was no longer worth using although the reviewer who loves this pan was certain the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly that certainty is based on nothing but speculation i cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by all clad of course i could have asked all clad to replace it early on since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord but that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off,negative
i bought the previous model of this dehydrator i seriously would not even give this machine 1 star but there is no lower rating i bought mine a year ago used it once and the bottom heating element burned every single tray that i rotated to the bottom which you have to do in order to get anywhere the entire machine was worthless within a week of me owning it i did eat the beef jerky but that was the most expensive jerky i will ever make i called immediately to complain talked to a guy named saul who said the unit must be defective duh and he would send me a new unit and a return authorization i have gotten neither i am just out the money i have called back faxed mailed waited on hold and finally decided that ronco products are crap i will never give him or his company another cent buyers please research your purchases i see from other reviews that i am not the only one with a complaint buy a different machine,negative

the stool is great as far as it s ability to function it is quite thin which makes it easy to store it does have a safety issue my 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together i almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion my husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus no more pinched fingers i would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around i was right there when my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger,negative

it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design the pot does a good job perking coffee but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot i think that melitta should send out for nothing the glass top i am like the other reviews i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits,negative
i loved this when we first got it home i m handicapped and can t push a big vacuum so this was just right to pick up the top showing dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week but after two months the ac adapter cord just snapped in half it was oddly brittle from the very beginning i contacted euro pro who would not replace it under warranty so i ordered a new adapter from them \( which came to approx 15 \) with shipping now six weeks later they sent me a card saying due to overwhelming demand the adapter is on back order i wonder why they have such a large demand funnily enough the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it s last charge but no more i think it s time to bury it and move onto an old fashioned \( no power \) push sweeper,negative

read the description carefully it states the speaker range is 50 not the microphone my dog stood 10 away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn t trigger matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand even then it didn t go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower i also couldn t get it to just make the ultrasonic sound even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise not just me but my husband too so it s not a case of super human hearing on my part \) yes the timer option is very nice this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking but what good is the timer function if the microphone can t pick up the barking so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else,negative
i bought this heater at lowe s after returning another delonghi model to amazon it s great for a bedroom because it is practically silent the heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm that was the good news the bad news is that after a few months it broke down it turns off when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up as another reviewer said it is now an attractive retro paperweight but that s about it i was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having i m not going to bother after battling with delonghi over other retro products i m giving up i won t buy any of their stuff anymore by the way if you want a great silent heater try the bionaire micathermic model \( bnrbh3900u \) it doesn t have the snazzy styling of the delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year,negative
this is an excellent product if you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium and making huge messes walking in puddles etc and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks this product is for you don t waste your money on cheap suction devices and buy the python today \( sorry if i sound like an infomercial i m just an enthusiastic user \) the python attaches to your faucet you turn the water on full blast stick the suction tube end into your tank and you can drain your tank in minutes or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes then you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up \( again in minutes \) i have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank and what used to take me a whole day now takes about an hour \( to do all tanks \) i like that i can vacuum the gravel boy does this thing suck the waste up this will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great i was skeptical that this product would work but am so glad that i bought it now i actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it the directions are easy to follow even for people like me who are direction impaired,positive
most importantly this is small this is the same size as one person clay pot rice or bibimbap it is the size of a deep rich fancy curry takeout one cup of steel cut oatmeals will fill up the pot upon expansion i have no regrets ordering this size because this is much easier to tote around now that i have received my shipment i know a yellow one with a brass knob would have been gorgeous but i have grown to prefer the red it s so pretty it didn t arrive chipped or anything so there s not much to say about how it works just keep the heat between medium to low i broke it in by making hot milk \( from powder \) with banana so yeah as a pot it heats stuff up no leaks p s one good thing about breaking in the cocotte with white liquid instead of clear water is that i saw two floating black segments that may have been pieces of the coating yes i did wash the cocotte in sudsy water before breaking it in i still don t know where those chips off of the 5 quart are now but i hope they are at least not or no longer in our bodies i think this try me size is a worthwhile purchase because it is light enough to lift up and tilt with one hand to pour into a serving bowl,positive
after buying an aluminum i read about the leaching of the mayerial into the food and the health risks involved i was advised to spend the extra money since this is a stock item i took it to wal mart and traded it for a 6 quart stainless boy was i surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as i used to have a sixx litter european and a whole chicken fits just fine anyway i can t recommend this because of the material and because of the size if i could afford it i would go for the electric pressure cooker with at least an 8 quart size of stainless cuisinart or other brands check amazon around 150 and up you get what you pay for,negative
first the good news this is an extra heavy skillet with durable finish and good handles it easily handles two quarts up to the bottoms of the rivets and distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pan but for the bad news i would give this skillet four or five stars the bad news is that someone at the anolon plant damaged the pan before it was placed in the anolon carton neither the anolon box nor the outer ups shipping carton showed any damage when i received the skillet it wasn t until the the following day after i threw out the packaging that i noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly true i should have been more attentive when i received the pan but i never suspected anolon would package damaged goods i ll live with my mistake but will not purchase anything by anolon again,negative

i have used wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness but i sincerely regret having bought these sheets i purchased one set and after the 2nd wash there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on \( all the little balls felt scratchy \) my husband asked me why we were using the old sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn i was so suprised that i called wamsutta directly and the very nice lady there assured me that i must have gotten a defective set because that simply doesn t happen with their sheets so i exchanged them with an identical pair and the end of the story is that i am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing what a disappointment absolutely do not recommend and am now very wary of all wamsutta products,negative
this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container,positive
i received this blender for x mas last year it has some nice design features \( good heavy base to prevent tipping measuring cup built into the cap \) however i experienced the same problems that others here have the blender doesn t do well with anything thick like milkshakes it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart while it worked ok for a while the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months,negative
i have not tried to program the timer yet but as a heater this is one of the nicest i have had compact yet it puts out a nice even heat it is save in that the unit itself doesn t get red hot the ad says factory reconditioned yet it came in a new box and looks like new a super deal for auxiliary heating i use it to warm the livingroom to keep oil consumption down which it seems to have done so far without too big an increase in the electric bill,positive
i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave,negative

ive had this vacumn for about 2 years after about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way still has very good power bad news it doesnt move around easy it is like dragging an old tire around hard to turn and direct canister always rolls over the only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt and dont vacumn that often i guess because i dread using it i am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while but still like i said lots of power if you keep the filter clean,negative
we ve had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it it toasts consistently it accommodates all widths and the digital selector is great,positive
yes watch out pls always try to read review before buying its true the picture is deceiving but what i don t understand is why amazon keep using this picture,negative

ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months and it is fun weve already gone through a cleary water filter our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy and its fully programmable i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon water it down or add skim for a really nice froth i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime so far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past i should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides i would buy it,positive
the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good,negative
we ve had this for about five years the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery the battery is soldered to the circuit board they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost 20 each way i opened it up cut out the old battery and duct taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months cooks rice great though,negative
we got this rice cooker as a christmas gift we ve tried cooking rice in it three times and all three times the rice has burned it simply gets too hot like some of the other reviewers we added more and more water but it didn t help the cooker finally does kick into warm mode but by then it s too late we were thrilled when we realized it was non stick but what good is non stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible,negative
i bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day this is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves some of the honeycombs get a little crushed but i ve found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them reese s puffs and cheerios also came out without any crushing you have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh maybe this was in the directions but i missed it and learned the hard way but the kids figured out the caps easily and it s not a big deal for them,positive
at first i wasn t so sure if it would work then it really worked it was amazing now every day i can a chocolate covered item whenever i want,positive
we have 2 airedale terriers \( 55 lb dogs \) and 2 cats i originally bought a scat mat as a deterrent to the cats but it has since become a dog deterrent one of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we re not at home this is the only deterrent that has proven effective it keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down \( as she ll keep getting shocked if she stands there \) i feel comfortable using the product as i have been shocked by it many times myself \( generally i step on it by accident in the middle of the night \) make no mistake it hurts and you don t want to have it happen but it certainly isn t bad enough that i feel cruel using it this is my second scat mat as the other one stopped working because of that i m a bit concerned about the durability especially considering the cost that said however the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last \( no wires going to the battery that may become detached \) so i am hopeful that this one will last longer either way however it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money,positive
this is a great product for holding your knives my wife and i got a nice set of henckel knives as a wedding present i couldn t figure out how i could transport the knives along with the blade savers this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives,positive
this could well be the perfect dog toy especially if your dog is a queensland heeler with a knack for destroying plastic frisbees tennis balls etc in seconds flat i ve had one for a couple of weeks now and aside from some dirt spots it looks new it is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not so tender mercies of my dog s attention this disc is not only very durable it actually flies really well as something of a flying disc connoisseur i can t help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries plus it floats perfect,positive
soft comfortable perfect i came back to buy more i want to throw the rest of my sheets away i was reluctant to buy sheets without being able to touch them first but am so glad i took the chance,positive

excellent when you want to bake a small cake this is absolutely a great small just the right size of a cake form,positive
too bad i didn t come here first at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did it s too bad too because this thing is a technological marval except it s defective from the very start my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is ideal so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water doesn t boil \( add salt \) or if it boils too rapidly \( add distilled water \) this will prevent spurting boiling over and overheated reservoirs the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already the unit boils like the bejesus on low putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking reset refill light i tried 4 times and even called tech support \( they were pretty clueless are you listening bionaire \) it s really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you can t tilt it to fix the problem \( most warm mist are designed that way for some reason,negative
i have found this item to be very helpful i only have 1 arm and dust pans are not an option now when i spill something i can clean it up on my own,positive
bought this at target returned it the next day not even close to the quality of b d t r o s from even a few years ago summed up in one word cheesy is the appropriate descriptor,negative
these mikasa spoons go perfectly with your demitasse or espresso cups very delicate with nice finish we enjoy them every time we use them,positive
i purchased this coffee maker and in three months time threw it out what a piece of you can never get a decent hot cup of coffee \( it is lukewarm at best \) and the carafe not only breaks so you have to replace it but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup what a dissapointment this machine is mr coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor i would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone the only nice thing i can say about it is the programmable timer worked i would not give this coffee maker one star but that was the lowest rating available if it were up to me i would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating,negative
this is great easy set up dishwasher safe \( top shelf only \) and super quiet \( there is a very faint humm \) our cats went right over to check it out it is kinda big but i expected that from the picture the only problem seems to be that some of the pieces are too big to fit in the top shelf of our ancient dishwasher 5 stars i d give it more if i could,positive
it is a very pretty maker and coffee is made under perfect conditions the price is good through amazon just make sure you use suggested filters the other do not work \( learned from experience \) if premium coffee is your thing and pretty is a bonus this maker is the answer,positive
i bought the machine about 2 weeks ago and it took me about 5 min to read the instructions and use the machine sorry but one would have to be an idiot not to understand how to use it i love its versatility e g espresso coffee or pods regular water or add bottle \( for those whose tap water is bad \( comes with an adapter \) \) froth maker for capuccino or steam water for tea it sure will draw wows from your friends as long as you remember to run a cup of water through before each time you use it your espresso should be the perfect temperature took me some time to realize why it was lukewarm the only bad thing \( why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars \) i have to say about the granos is that in order to remove the portafilter i e the part with the handle holding the coffee you have to use force but maybe after a few months it will loosen up a bit and things will be easier all in all i am completely satisfied with its user friendliness crema temperature and versatility,positive
this cooks bacon crisp without any mess or spatter just place a couple of paper towels over the bacon i was using my george foreman grill but this is easier to clean,positive
poor quality the cover leaks i had to return it back do not buy,negative
after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso \( and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines \) i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it my main concern was how hot the coffee would be and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee i ve read reviews about the noise it makes and after having the deloghi product the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all we are very happy with it buy it you ll be happy too,positive
i bought this as a upgrade from the glass carafe that came with my aroma control machine i was tired of burnt coffee due to the burner burning it this carafe keeps coffee steaming hot for hours a great upgrade,positive
the distribution of heat in this pan is super great for gravies and sauces i have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking stir frying can reduce fats and is usually a pretty healthy way to eat a wide variety of veggies and other delightful ingredients i even use it to pop brown rice or basmati rice ever tried hot puffed rice sometimes i eat it just like pop corn but often just for a different way of serving rice this pan is deep enough with or without the lid to keep it from popping out of the pan \( depending how much you start with \) it is also useful to cook or finish foods in the oven up to 500 degrees and it is kitchenaid i expect it to outlast me,positive
i was very impressed with the infomercials on this product and was about to buy the set before i read a very detailed and thorough online review at http www epinions com content 180924944004 the reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product among her pet peeves things do stick to the product use a flour cooking spray for better results odors do stay with the product not easy to clean the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps size of the pieces are small the pieces are so flexible that if you don t place the food neatly in the pan you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results you can slice through the product easily guarantee is shakey at best and so on there are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light and more importantly i personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis i for one definitely will not buy this product please consider this recap of another s review a public service buyer beware,negative
the krups xp 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now with no problems to speak of we use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily and each time it has been very good a notice i would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided the provided tamper is plastic and can be wobbly but i am very satisfied with the product,positive
not functional bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it impossible to use the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly also it came in a box that was damaged and taped together \( not the shipping box the polder box that the product comes in \) looks like someone returned it previously \( probably for the same reasons \) and it was then sent to me i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted time to throw it out waste of money,negative

was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven,negative
the design is great the function is not always difficult to get both in the same package i m going to return it it toasts unevenly toast is not crisp it burns a corner of the toast,negative
as i tend to nurse a cup of tea at the office for a while i decided to purchase this product this after looking around for a good desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug such a product just doesn t seem to exist check the amazon customer ratings i had one a number of years ago and it was lousy \( had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap but no one has \) i purchased this mug just about a month ago it s so good i had to share the secret and even if an improved electric warmer did exist i don t think i d bother with its cord and risks given how good this is i m sorry to see though that it s no longer available through amazon \( perhaps elsewhere on the web \) i can make a mug of tea \( a generous 20 oz \) around 10a m and even by mid to late afternoon 4 or 5p m it s still warm enough to enjoy and that s after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough to drink indeed if there s a fault with it it s almost too efficient if you use boiling water for the tea and want to take a sip right after you ve finished brewing though called a travel mug it won t fit into any auto cupholder i ve seen it s really perfect for a desk it s relatively low \( taller than a typical ceramic mug though \) the base is nice and wide and there s a ring of rubber silicone type material \( which has not scuffed anything on my desk \) around the edge of the bottom that really is non slip between these features it seems quite stable the removable black plastic top \( friction secured with the typical silicone type o ring around the edge \) allows you to move the opening anywhere you want to use left or right handed there s a simple slide to open close the drinking aperature the interior is also stainless steel so no plastic taste even with boiling water inside the outside remains virtually at room temperature \( as you d expect given its thermal efficiency \) my only complaint \( minor \) is that it is not dishwasher safe \( and i haven t tested it \) but it s easy to hand wash with the wide mouth you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom i have several inexpensive auto insulated mugs \( key word here i think is inexpensive \) that are truly underwhelming so initially i didn t have high expectations for this but it really is fantastic if you want a hot beverage to keep for several hours on your desk this is for you no regrets,positive
if i could give this product 0 stars i would read the negative reviews folks and be forewarned i believed the positive reviews and ignored the negative ones much to my exasperation when i plugged my handsome new oven in the little red digital display numbers came on right away hmmm so far so good but according to the instructions you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell sooo the owner s manual says to push the bake button on the dashboard which in turn lights the pilot lid light on the display after which you can set time and temp so i push the bake button and nothing happens no lid light comes on nothing zilch zippo so i then push the temp and time lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up still nothing i unplugged it and and plugged it in again thinking that maybe somehow i had screwed that up while listening for the beep the owner s manual said should happen whence the unit is plugged in zilch zippo nothing no beep no bake lid light tried pusing the temp and time buttons again nada tried unpugging it again and doing the whole shebang all over again still nothing it just sat there and grinned at me about this time i figured out that my unit was also dead on arrival at least you can get a parcel paid bill of lading printed off from the amazon website for a defective product return saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product you have already paid for and now must wait weeks to get a refund on amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse and run them over with a forklift,negative
this purchase came with 3 stackable racks i thought it was only one rack it stores very easily in a compact space and works well i don t know if it rusts since i have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it,positive
the first use wasn t too bad it cut things well but the lock locks too easily without something even touching it so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use safety is nice but that is just annoying the biggest problem is the coil spring is not stainless steel so the inside of it rusts even if you take it apart for each washing once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult toclose the shears making cutting a real pain literally i soak the spring regularly in rust remover but i can not use it no more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand my prior shears lasted for 10 years but these i need to replace after a couple of months,negative
this came broken the packaging was not good damage good don t make happy custome,negative
this unit can only dry half of what it can wash which is not that much it takes a total of 4 1 2 hours to do one load of laundry if you only put 11lbs of wash in i have a family of five and i am over run with laudry because of this machine,negative

this is horrible at keeping coffee hot it gets cold quick buy another brand i bought this model and a larger zojirushi 1 9 liter stainless steel model at the same time they both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch the 1 9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button also it is the worst stainless steel i have ever seen it stains instantly and for ever i had another zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic but something has happened over the last 10 years their quality has really gotten bad,negative
i live in sw florida everything down here rusts even the nails in the walls i am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives amazon has a deal i couldn t refuse 90 steak knives for only 29 99 i bought two sets and i couldn t be happier it will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight after using big clunky steakhouse style wooden handle knives for so many years my husband might not be as enthusiastic as i am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well i will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp but i don t keep my knives in boxes no storage room i have a lot of stainless steel german knives and i consider them to be the best i have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there handy and nice looking these will complete my collection of nice looking knives on that wall handy where i can just reach up and grab them you just can t beat the price but if you don t like them you can return them amazon is the best place i have found to buy everything i need for my kitchen bar none i will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures,positive
while cute this little pan is difficult to use there s no room to use a spatula so you d better like the eggs cooked through you can t flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it s so small that it won t fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers,negative

we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the rechargable battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one,negative
at first we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner after one year however it started sounding like a jet engine the turbo nozzle had broken i live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things and when i ordered a new turbo nozzle they sent a mini it turns out that the actual replacement nozzle listed at 29 99 a year ago now costs 125 00 the explanation i got was prices are subject to change without notice now i m stuck with a 5 inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me plus the cord which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button creeps in while we re vacuuming and when we press the button too i love it at first but i ll never buy another electrolux it s not well made and they don t stand behind their product,negative

i have only had it for a few days but moving up from a krups pump system with only 1050w of heating this unit rocks it used to take me about 10 minutes to make a latte with the krups as it took forever to heat uo and never made enough steam this unit heats very fast and makes fantastic steam for the frother which works fantastic minus the complaint everyone has the frother is way to low to the ground they fixed this with the evolution model watch the video the tamping and normal uses need to be followed very closely i have to use the perfect crema device to make crema which it does great this unit also can be used to heat water for tea in like 2 mins which is pretty cool you just fire up the unit wait till it heats then flip the espresso switch not the steam switch with the steam adjuster already open then hot water comes from the frother and boom tea the drip tray is worthless and is supposedly fixed in the evolution model but for 200 this machine is amazing very professional level equipment the abs shell is pretty flimsy but if it stays on the counter which mine does it will be fine i don t need to spend another 300 for the stainless model even though i would if i has a nicer kitchen just so it matched \( i rent but still have really nice appliances \),positive
i have never used any other dehydrator s and found this very simple to use clean store and the price was great plus it makes my house smell great when i m using it so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i m finding it enjoyable to use,positive
this pillow looks simple enough but there must have been a lot of research put into inventing it the dogbone \( medium size about 16 w i don t remember specific dimensions \) instantly relieved many aches i had in my neck without forcing me to lie down in a flat position \( which often gives me a headache and makes it impossible to read while lying down \) i d been to the doc quite a few times for the back neck problems i ve had lately but no rx worked quite as well as this delightful cushion my only issues with it are cleaning \( stuffing s packed very tight so i d rather not try it out in the washer for fear of mold mildew i spray it with disinfectant every once in a while instead \) the outer material \( an optional moisture wicking or allergen reducing pillowcase would be nice \) however i bought it based on earlier reviews and i don t regret it,positive
a collegue of mine raved about it she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office i tried it for a day but was not convinced either way then i bought the largest model and tried it at home i used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the acid test i used it in the toilet room closed the door and let it sit there for 8 hours when i inspected the room i could still smell what i smelled 8 hours earlier and i so wanted it to work the other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor \( as does a hepa air filter \),negative
the first dishwasher that i received from etronics was dented dirty and looked as though it had been used i complained they picked it up and one month later i got the replacement it wasn t in much better shape but i kept it anyway because i was tired of waiting the dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes and although it cleans well the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made and it leaks even with teflon tape i would not make this purchase again,negative

the pans look very nice and very durable but they are not save your money do not buy this i had to put them through the dishasher a second time to remove some more of the sticky residue on the bottom of the pan from the label when they came out of the dishwasher there were rust spots all over them i am going to try and return mine as soon as i get a chance i never even got to use the pans before they rusted it should be noted that a \) the pans were never left soaking in water or in the sink b \) there was not anything even the tiniest bit rusty in the dishwasher with them to have rubbed off rust onto them or anything like that horrible horrible pans they should be ashamed to make or sell these,negative

order the wok and got it damaged \( off shaped \) the packaging is horrible basiclly they put the bare wok in the box filled with the giant air bubbles the wok can move around freely in the box guess the damage is caused during shipping return and reordered the typhoon carbon steel wok similar size and design 3 cheaper when i got it i am very pleased with the quality \) properly packaged plastic cover on the top sheet of paper on the bottom fitted in a box designed for it \) thick steel 2 5mm rather than 1 8mm from joyce chen \) handles are welded on the wok so no dead spot when cleaning \) seasoning instruction are well documented in 8 different languages even thou i use my own seasoning way not like joyce chen s one thin sheet of paper with not so clear instruction overall joyce chen s wok is like the one you can get from chinatown supermarket and typhoon one is like from macy s,negative
we purchased the delonghi based on its ease of cleaning \( 4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher \) after the third use the plastic part that holds the heating element in place melted off the base delonghi service was apologetic and promised to send a replacement part asap although the part was out of stock that was in september almost 6 months ago parts are still backordered i returned the unit to lowes in frustration got a new unit and it too melted on the first use returned it for credit do not consider this unit,negative

impressive machine overall i ve had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch looking around on the internet this seems to be fairly common i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine the attachments are great for hard floors and furniture i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point even the refurbished one,positive
i really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush unfortunetly it is just messy annoying and takes up counter space when you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction if the cereal is too big \( honeycomb size \) it doesn t come out easily if it is too small \( fruity pebbles \) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere i definetly would not buy this product again at one point i even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away the time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter,negative
this pan is a good buy and a wonderful size for 2 3 member families although not as heavy as some of the french copper pans i have many of the commercial calphalon pieces and love the handle the pan is definately heavier than cheap quality pans and the stainless interior is just what i wanted for acidic based cooking \( tomato sauces etc \) as far as scratches well what do you expect if you use it it is going to get some scratches the brushed exterior helps hide some of the outside marks though some have complained about scratches on the other calphalon hard anodized but most of the time they really aren t scratches but rather aluminum marks from the rivets when stacking in any case they are easily removed with scotchbrite and some cleaner enjoy p s i chose the no shipping cost delivery and received the pan in just 4 days,positive

this is a great idea but i think it might need more tweaking the reservoir holds a lot of water which is good but there is no filter so any cat hair stray food or whatever your 18 month old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl then it sits there usually after sinking to the bottom until you dig it out also with mine at least you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear a shame since the cat really did like the few bubbles i was able to coax out if this somehow filtered the water and made bubbles i d be all over it \( like cat hair on a pastel couch \),negative
i love this item perfect for storing pet food special screw type tops that seals food bugs mice cannot get in easy to wash let it air dry my only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it so those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed over all the best in food storage i know i just about bought them all,positive
having used hoover products in a commercial environment for many years i have had great service from them providing many years of dependable and powerful operation we were excited to try out this new hoover model one of the first things i have noticed about it over the previous windtunnel model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum this may bother some but i see it as a testament to it s improved build quality over the gen 1 windtunnel this machine is very powerful and it s dual turbine motor has a confident sound i ll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is it is a nice feature though i ll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is update after having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 1 \) lacks a bag full indicator the bag filled on this machine and then busted \( unknowlingly \) at the top around the bag collar stuff went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter it took another vacuum to clean the mess up in the future i will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle indicating how full the bag is getting 2 \) the cord rewinder is a nice feature but truly lacks quality it will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance a stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference 3 \) dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head not that it presents a problem but it s unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns,positive

i initially bought this coffeemaker because i remembered my dad s sunbeam silex type coffeemaker it made great coffee and so does the bodum problem with the bodum is that i had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material the folks at bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem i am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if i continue to have a problem,negative

as a vintner we remove the co2 from the wine as part of our process this device uses co2 to pop the cork very clever however this minor introduction of co2 is insignificant and will vent quickly at times there is an off taste like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine let it breath for a while 5 minutes or so and it seems ok this device works well on corks but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective rew,positive
none of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff i bought this and the 8 fry pan 2 months ago and except for the bottoms still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day i even used a bacon press \( cast iron \) in it every time i cooked bacon and a couple of times i accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left hubby stacked knives and forks inside then topped it off with 6 dinner plates i thought it was done for scratches and nicks everywhere but no not a single mark my calphalon commercial nonstick \( which hit the trash already \) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr old did that i must admit though that i do not use metal utensils in it nor do i put in a dishwasher since i won t have one til the kitchen is remodeled overall though just from what abuse it has gotten i m very impressed and will buy more my advice don t mess with the rest buy the best and this is it going to try the wok next wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it,positive
i just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum it cuts the cleaning time in half from 8 10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop and spraying the box down down to only 2 minutes it s just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes litter maid products i ve seen and the price is reasonable i wish i had this for my previous cats i ve owned,positive

i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away she would use a flashlight to do little reading well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes but it does do the job,positive
hunter fan arrived in 2 days from amazon com and immediately i noticed the weight of the fan heavy just the way i like it unpacked this beauty and plugged her in and off she went with a beautiful sound i love the 3 wing blade and the speed variation is great from barely running to blow your hat off we love it keep up the good work hunter i intend to buy one for a christmas gift also,positive
we bought these for our two girls \( 2 and 5 \) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great for a while now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time \( 5 months since we ordered \) they haven t been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat same issue with the bowls ymmv but when 3 out of 4 are dead i think there is a problem,negative

i had researched this product for juicing ability and power i ended up buying this one and after using it twice the motor just shut off i returned this product and waited 3 months for the replacement i decided to try juicing carrots and celery and after no more than 5 minutes the motor just shut itself off again i might be able to forgive this if it was the only problem with it if you are juicing small things like berries with larger vegetables fruit the unit will get off balanced shake the top loose and damage the blade i know i read these bad reviews and said oh that won t happen to me but it did i hope you choose a different juicer,negative
this is by far the best toaster we ve ever owned it does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional so i don t know how it works yet but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side a fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation the bagels we toasted in it were just perfect the microwave is large enough inside for my purposes which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting i never use microwave popcorn so i can t say how well it does in that area but the frozen burrito i cooked last night came out terrific regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving i think what the company is referring to is the fact that while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster this does indeed save space not to mention an electrical outlet overall i m very pleased with it but haven t had it long enough to speak to its longevity i can tell you that it s almost worth buying for the toaster alone,positive

i m very happy with this mixer it arrived in pristine condition even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints i bought it mainly for bread making and after a certain amount of practice i m turning out great products i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard my only gripe is not with the machine but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured i got the hd i have researched as much as i can and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting but i just don t understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying seems kind of elementary to me,positive

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products the enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently for this reason it is recommended to use on low to medium heat there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay otherwise cooking with high heat may cause food to stick discolor the enamel coating or cook the food unevenly remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide \( rust \) doesn t add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain it adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically this pan holds 5 1 4 quarts of food measures 9 3 4 x 14 x 3 inches internally and weighs 10 2 pounds 5 1 4 quarts will typically feed 8 10 people when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3 4 full any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac n cheese while not so desirable for other dishes add the le creuset 9 x 11 1 2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash lasagna scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials heck cast iron doesn t seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of pros extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10 2 pounds,positive

i grind beans for my coffee every morning i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder sold the old grinder in a garage sale i do regret buying this grinder it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 my main complaint is that it is messy the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it also coffee grounds are everywhere i always have to use a cloth to clean up not a good buy,negative

admittedly i am a bit of a knife buying nut i love kitchen knives and own chef s knives and santuko knives from wusthof henckels kyocera and furi this calphalon katana 6 inch chef s knife is incredibly sharp and it feels really good in the hand balance wise i like the way the handle is shaped it is very comfortable and the bolster is ingenious i love the way it looks too for the price i d say you can t go wrong i really like it a lot i have only had it for a few weeks though but it seems to be of very good quality and hopefully we ll see how well it resharpens when the need arises,positive

we already owned the 7 inch santoku knife purchased locally from a kitchen retailer and loved it we were a little hesitant at first since we ve only ever had cheaper knives but as soon as we felt it in our hands and tried the knife we were sold still the 7 inch is a little big for small jobs so we decided to get this 4 inch paring knife i coupled a gift certificate with an amazon com kitchen coupon promotion and was able to get the 4 inch paring knife and the 8 inch bread knife for a very good price this should pretty much complete our knife set from my experience these three knives are versatile enough for almost any job the 4 inch paring knife specifically is great for smaller jobs where the santoku would be awkward it s balanced perfectly stays sharp and since it s a single piece it cleans easily and you don t have to worry about the handle breaking all in all great knife and highly recommended,positive

i bought these molds for my crystal light drinks so that i could have a more nutritious dessert option the molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money the plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom impossible to get back out and the taste will go with it i have fun using these and they were reasonably priced,positive
this juicer is extremely heavy made of industrial type metal parts but it s poorly machined and assembled the heavy parts don t fit together well and the juicer is wobbly and unstable despite it s heaviness i am sending this back without using it once becuase there s no way to adjust the parts and it s too unstable to use as is also it really is almost impossible to pick up and move due to the weight without straining your back finally like a reviewer of the orange x large size juicer i find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places it seem like the kind of company where to get a good product you d have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one,negative
this is a very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner if you just need to clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it will perform great should you actually try to use the beater brush attachment you will be very dissappointed i bought this cleaner for the purpose of cleaning my curtians and stairs i own two cats and virtually all of my in laws are allergic to them everytime they come i have to clean the house top to bottom my upright vacuum \( dirt devil vision lite model 008650 \) weighs a ton and was not designed to use on stairs i thought this little cleaner might be just the trick the brush worked great the first several times i used it but after about 20 uses it began to slow down i cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw the initial performance again eventually it stopped working at all i urge you to buy something else if the beater brush is a selling point for you,negative

i bought this for my husband three years ago and he absolutely loves it in fact many people who come to our house ask about it as the coffee is superb we are very picky about our coffee tending to buy expensive brands and grind the beans ourselves and this coffeemaker wins hands down over the many we have had through the years i would never consider another brand and would hesitate to buy another model the coffee is usually hot throughout the day \( depending on how much is in it of course \) as my husband always heats it with boiling water before he brews the coffee we have never had the first problem with boilovers leaking implosions \( huh \) etc in fact i m getting one for my daughter and her husband for christmas as they always admire ours,positive

the bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status this causes the fabric to be so thin you can just about see your hand through it also out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled the good news is that the red border color that i chose did not bleed in the washer further they did not shrink at all i don t know how they feel to sleep on as they are for a guest bed for occasional use only just by the way they look if i were to use them daily i would have returned them,negative

this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen it s the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons you ll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant good stones are expensive though i think it s worth it for such a fine knife,positive

it appears that the viatek product \( bark stop pro \) is related to the lentek design \( pc16 asin b0002q89o6 \) they are based on a common design by a lentek engineer i have used \( tried \) the viatek bark stop pro and it definitely does not work my experience was the same as another reviewer of the lentek pc16 who noted that the unit only works on the audible setting dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ultrasonic setting furthermore it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds banging doors wind noise etc this really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction quality i ve tried two different units and they both do not work the negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks,negative
i have nice sharp blades i sliced veggies and got all these tiny little plastic hairs that the cutting mat gave off as i sliced it up along with my veggies had to toss them these mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough or any other purpose other than for what they are made for chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects for the price it was worth testing them out,negative

the refill accessory \( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes \) definitely cuts the refill maintenance in half since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher safe and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected,positive

was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven,negative
i just love this garlic roaster it roasts up to 3 med size bulbs of garlic in less than 30 min i like the idea of a mini roaster so i do not have to heat up my convection oven for such a small quanity of garlic it is easy to clean and has great appeal in the kitchen it has an automatic light and lets you know when roasting is complete it cooks to perfection while lightly roasting the garlic \( top facing down \) and i like to use a cloth to handle the hot garlic and squeeze them into my mashed potatoes if you allow the garlic to cool off the cloves firm up and are great eaten with a desert fork i use spanish roja garlic in this roaster and it comes out perfect every time i have used this machine for 5 months now and have since purchased another one as a gift,positive
i just got this waffle maker and have already made a perfect batch of honey wheat blueberry waffles i can t believe how easy it was and how fat and fluffy they came out i used krusteez mix because i was out of eggs and used frozen blueberries the mix told me to add a little oil for waffles the booklet told me to plug it in and wait for the green light i sprayed it with pam i poured in 1 2 cup of the mix on each side added blueberries to the top closed it flipped it and that was it the booklet says they are done when the steam stops they were brown before the steam stopped so i pulled them out no sticking no spills i almost purchased an 80 00 model but decided to get this one after seeing all of the reviews what a great deal,positive
some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 is defective out of the box so far i ve made 40 shots of espresso and 10 steamed ciders and i ve been very pleased with the product i ve been working on improving my technique and now i think the espresso is excellent i prefer my homemade shots to the stuff i buy at starbucks and most other cafes though this could be due to delusional pride in my own amateur baristaship also i may be over excited because i d wanted an espresso machine for so long the negatives \( so far \) are that it looks like there are is a fair amount of ongoing maintenance cleaning of the machine though i doubt that this is unique to this brand also as others have mentioned the espresso spout is low so i drink my coffee out of ceramic ramikins \( although aren t low spouts authentic \) also i haven t gotten the steamer working quite right and i always end up with cappuccinos \( all foam \) even if i m trying to make a latte hopefully i ll get better with time as for reliability i ve only made 40 shots so i can t speak to the long term quality but so far so good and heck 40 espresso drinks at starbucks would ve cost me over 120 by now although making it at home still isn t free if you use the convenient pods it s still about 50 cents a shot and illy beans are expensive \( right now i m using an unground dark roasted kona which is deep and very smooth \),positive
the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again,negative

i ordered two of these great fiesta handled carafes in black i plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so i had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase i have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces i was not happy when i received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips \( where the white under the glaze shows through \) as well as scratches in the glaze \( which i have never seen before and can t imagine what happened to put them there \) in my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds i love the pieces i m just dissappointed with the quality of the finish i also received a black covered butter which was blemish free,positive

i ve had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sight protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger made mostly for show blocks would if you re looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger that s just my opinion i could be wrong,positive
after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf with an interesting pattern on the crust my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf and much more rustic natural than using a loaf pan the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old fashioned way when it s done rising carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre heated bread stone in the oven the loaves look and taste great,positive

what an awesome product heavy duty and sturdy you d never know it was an assemble at home item it s a quality piece of furniture it s on wheels which is a good thing because it is surprisingly heavy let s start at the top the butcher block top it s three inches thick and as such it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart it is made of fine high quality asian hardwoods the finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil the next is the cart itself immediately under the butcher block top there is a 2 deep drawer it s large and deep enough to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice the pull handle on the drawer is fashioned out of brushed chrome beneath the drawer there is a shelf surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods adding a modern look matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors the pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish the cabinet is large enough to hold an entire set of dinnerware \( as in my case where i have eight place settings that include dinner and luncheon plates fruit and soup bowls and more \) finally heavy duty professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing the two in the front are locking to prevent stubbed toes the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit the easy to follow directions for assembly \( which are diagrammed and in english \) call only for a philips screwdriver a hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts i used an electric screwdriver for both the philips screws \( 14 in all \) and the hex bolts \( after i found the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver \) i can happily report that all pieces fit together easily \( no struggling to match up this piece with that piece \) and all holes are pre drilled the drawer requires assembly also the runners for the drawer are already attached you must put together the front sides and back of the drawer with screws \( again all holes are pre drilled \) a word of advice regarding assembling the drawer follow the directions where it says to put the screws in only halfway before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer i made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble sliding the bottom into the assembled front back and sides it s a snug fit once i loosened the screws enough the bottom easily popped into place and i was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws i have only one other thing to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright you must lift the butcher block and set it down on the top of the cart at this point you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart and they re pointing upward these screws will fit into four pre drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block you must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart because the butcher block is so heavy you may want to have help but what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture it ended up being ikea sells a similar item for twice the money i give the home styles double door kitchen cart with butcher block top 5 stars because of the beauty of the product and its better than a bargain price,positive

being a wine lover i ve used all kinds of corkscrews from your basic twist model to the kind with the wings to the two pronged kind finally i received the screwpull as a gift and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end as others have said the screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up so there s no actual pulling whatsoever all you do is simiply turn the easy to use lever at the top of the device in almost 10 years of usage the screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try \( probably because i started too close to the edge \) simply starting over solved the problem spend a little more money to buy the screwpull and you ll never need to buy another corkscrew again highly recommended,positive

i bought this sheet set the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son he too loves star wars and as i read the other reviews im nodding my head these sheets feel like burlap i have washed them regularly since december with no improvement they dont fade though which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 polyester and only 30 cotton very stiff and scratchy,negative
my company bought one of these to replace the similar capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after n years after 2 days the led readout of the functional information stopped working the machine continues to operate but you can t tell what s going on how much water it will use for your particular cup etc very disappointing we ll see how good the warranty repair is and report back to you after we experience that,negative
this is probably my favorite mug it easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup it comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim the best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over even hard corners don t seem to phase it it s also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat s efforts to tip it over the odd shape also has downsides though it won t fit in any cup holder i ve ever come across but that doesn t matter much since it won t tip over no matter where you set it if you don t rinse it out immediately it can be difficult to clean later due to the shape if you don t have small hands you may need a bottle cleaning brush also i imagine if you had more than one of these mugs they d be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space despite this it s still a great mug in fact i m going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too,positive
i ve always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for 1 keeps the beverage hot for hours 2 when sealed it does not leak at all 3 easy to drink from and dribble free 4 suitable for right and left hand drinkers 5 fits into most car cup holders 6 clips to straps loops handles to carry easily even when filled 7 easy to clean and stays stain smell free 8 rubber accents provide non slip grips and doesn t make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table 9 high quality construction for durability 10 it looks really cool this mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug i look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug finally a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user this is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price,positive
i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than 5 same concept just a lot cheaper two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they re holding i m sure it s pinhole sized if you re hanging something that weighs a few ounces \( in which case you don t need this use a pushpin \) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin sized but it is a heavy shelf the hole is still way smaller than the hole i d make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks \( the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang \) this is a small detail but if you need two of these things and you don t do it right your object is gonna be crooked but on the bright side you won t have a huge hole to patch when you redo it recommended product \( but look around for the knockoffs,positive

i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot,negative

as far as whisks for non stick surfaces go the silicone encased wires are very flexible a far cry from the hard thick plastic whisks with only a few wires they are ideal for non stick surfaces except for one problem the silicone is soft and not durable after a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer the silicone gets easily cut the silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose i have been very careful but this works out to probably 2 each time i used it,negative
if you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner then you will love this one i bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large \( and heavy \) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair because of the small bagless chamber you have to empty it frequently so i wouldn t count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner i wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs specifically to pick up pet hair and this vacuum exceeded my expectations i tried the shark a similar model made by fantom and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does \( stay away from the fantom cordless by far the worst \) i don t think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did overall this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean ups or to maintain pet hair free area rugs one suggestion use the carpet setting even on bare floors the brushes are high enough so they won t scratch bare floors but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush i found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless i used the carpet setting the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying,positive
this nifty piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so i got it i really wanted to get the air o swiss one but alas it cannot be found or shipped to canada weirdly so far i am less than impressed took me forever to even get it working the constant resetting is tiring i did find a solution \( initial anyway \) you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir \( where the round filter is \) and then it works the noise it makes is not easy to get used to no matter how tired you are i am trying it for one night then if i can t sleep i will return it it s not worth the money my advice save up and get the air o swiss,negative

if i had to do it over again i would try a different mat \( something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic \) pros 1 reduces tracking somewhat 2 more attractive than other litter mats 3 doesn t take up too much space cons 1 my cat doesn t like it most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet 2 it s too smal,negative

before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i ve tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud don t waste your mone,negative

here i have a refurbished palinato x3 textured very hardy stainless and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws 170 to start \( 6 mo warranty \) but let me correct one point made in these reviews the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic a rather new trend that works quite well the steam nob as well seems to be this material all around this is quite an improvement on the x1 more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x1 cups warm quicker also it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better still it s important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming fat content just makes more fat not true foamed milk,positive

these cups are high quality stainless steel don t worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink i was surprised by their weight and long handles my old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups these miu cups are extremely sturdy the handles on my old cups were more typical too while these miu cups all have very long handles \( 4 5 \) at first i didn t like the asthestics of the handles nor the fact that the smaller ones don t stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates however when i needed to scoop something out of a small mouthed container i quickly reversed my opinion of these handles cricisms the interior has perpendicular corners i prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying still it doesn t make much of a difference also while they re not hard to store they don t stack all that well so they ll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers \( 5 5 \) i suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease \( \) for the 5 cups i m extremely satisfied i feel these are top of the line the 7 cup set is overpriced \( \) so definitely go with these i don t understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2 3 and 3 4 cups just use the 1 3 cup twice or the 1 4 three times or eyeball the 1 cup \(,positive

my 13 year old cat was limping for a few days off and on and my vet said it was probably arthritis a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try it really made a difference he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake he was so happy and so was i on my vet s recommendation i continued giving him one tuna flavored capsule each day sprinkled over his food as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis and buying it from amazon saved me about 2 3 of the cost from the vet,positive

i also had a problem with the coating flaking off within the first week of using it the only reason i still use it is because i m a poor college student that got it as a gift in the first place and can t afford a new one after scrubbing the inside bottom of the wok furiously i managed to get all the flakes off and then some the lid is made of thin aluminum and has bent almost completely out of shape awful product do not buy this wok,negative
my wife wanted two sets to match our new family room decor well they turned out to be so beautiful that we have replaced our good formal china with this set really gorgeous pattern and color the red has a slight orange cast and is not a perfect match for a more maroon red the sets arrived in perfect condition although the two outside box were very beat up excellent packaging a fabulous deal,positive

some how my previous review text got a little glitched up but suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut the manufacture of these knives is well below the quality i expected it s the first time i ve been totally disappointed we re returning the knives because they are not worth the money really they look great in the picutre but they are very poor quality why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars,negative

we purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use we make probably 20 30 cups of coffee a day our problems began the first week after receiving it the machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam which lattes shouldn t have so customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy we called the manufacturer s customer service and were rudely brushed off for a small business like us it is hard to close for 2 3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service so we had to deal with it another problem came up 3 4 weeks later when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate just to steam milk at the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours which we did it did not shut off for 1 day the next day the problem started again i perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily so you can not say that the machine is being neglected we are very disappointed with this machine for the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite understanding and helpful now we are looking for another machine a back up one to be able to send impressa z5 for service,negative

this toaster oven is perfect i have had this oven for about 6 months and had enjoyed cooking meals in the summer months without heating up the entire house i have even cooked a whole chicken in it this oven cooks food evenly and i have had no problems with it at all i highly recommend this product update i still have this toaster oven and use it almost everyday i still absolutely love it and don t understand why everyone else seems to have issues with it i don t know what i would do with out this oven i have owned it for over 3 years and it still works perfect i recently cooked a prime rib in it and it turned out fabulous,positive
the first time i used this waffle maker i was very disappointed and regretted the purchase however i gave it another chance the second time i used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great my husband said they were even better than the ones i used to make to avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out i lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it,positive

corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo,negative

i bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago used 2 x daily and cleaned every month with either vinegar or special cleaner unfortunately it began leaking water from outside top of machine very poor quality machine i just threw mine out in the trash bin just got tired of constantly having to mop up after it don t buy this coffeemaker a waste of good money \( i paid 99 99 \),negative
i was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night it sounded great and much cheaper then the henckels of the world and look at all the different types of knives not worth it these knives don t cut well at all \( as compared to my henckel knife \) i wish i didn t buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives also the block holder is huge it takes up too much space,negative
this 2 qt bowl has many uses i use it for mixing serving and baking it is wonderful for macaroni and cheese also have done cobblers i have 6 different colors once you get one you will have to get another and another,positive
disappointing at best i was truly disappointed in this item after purchasing it we followed the directions for conditioning the non stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as before each use as listed in the use and care guide it sounds simple enough wait for the green indicator light to come on add the batter close but do not latch the lid the green light will go off when it comes back on the waffle is ready the only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue the waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts we said well ok maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it before they start to come out right 7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first the price is great the design is nice the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work at least not for us i told my wife i would take it back to the store and exchange it she said don t you dare bring another one of those things home with you it s to bad too we both love waffles,negative
i have to admit that i love this set especially since i found it hard to find white flannel sheets most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen so when i found these and at this price i was quite happy they feel great not the best flannel but nice all the same but after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore later the fitted started getting holes so since this was rather cheap i am not horribly sad about it so if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning this is the set for you,negative
i loved these sheets when i first got them they look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them after laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases i have laundered these in tide with no bleach what a shame they did not hold up well,negative
if you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed don t i have two areobeds i bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out the pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it fifteen years later it still works like a charm i liked it so much i recently bought a minute bed because i needed another guest bed it does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa the battery is nicad which means it develops a memory so now even if i remembered to charge it the day before it does not run long enough to inflate the bed they do not offer a separate electric detachable pump so now i m stuck with a plastic carpet that cannot be inflated with anything else the areobeds work great but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion buy a different type,negative
i bought this pan and to my suprise i had to assemble the handles on the skillet and the lid the handles on the skillet were not bad at all but the lid anyway after i got it assembled wash and dried per the instruction manual i plugged it in a began cooking it was amazing my chicken came out beautiful two days later i was cooking and the thing went out on me it became cool to the touch i left it alone for a while thinking maybe i did something wrong but i was already cooking at a low temperature it did not come back on when i replugged it in hence i had to give it back i was so disappointed i am just glad it did not happen while cooking the feast i had planned for the following week save your mone,negative
i have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than 30 a month after we purchased this water filter i can tell there s little difference between the water i buy at the store and the water from this filter i also feel confident if my daughters drink it because i know they re not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water i recommend this filter,positive

i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years and in general i have been happy with them but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used the product description does warn you that it s only heat resistant to 250 degrees but i was flipping eggs in a skillet which i consider a basic use for a spatula if it can t handle the heat of a hot skillet than i don t think it s a useful spatula not to mention that it s neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food,negative
this is our first juicer and we are have a great time juicing everything we use it a lot with our smoothie maker it is designed well and is very easy to clean it does drip a bit for a while from the spout but that isn t a problem at all we got this because we have a 2 year old and a 16 year old we wanted to make it easy to give them great tasting sweets that are good for them my 16 year old son loves apple juice and makes it all the time now no more soda in our house,positive
i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time however as other reviewers noted almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day i wasn t intending to use the delay feature very often so i didn t bother to return it now just short of a year after i received it it suddenly started working so i m shopping for a replacement i might try another mr coffee model with better reviews but not this one,negative
what people don t think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug i m not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it i have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross especially water who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face not me not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything it smells good and i can t imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some a great mug you should buy,positive

i should have paid more attention to the reviews i was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn t be used as an everyday or long term solution we ve been using the crate for less than three months and already the zipper one one end \( that we use all the time \) is screwed up and half the time it doesn t open at least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out but i m afraid of the morning when i try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck \( we leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in when she gets a little older we will leave her in her crate all day \) we could still use the zippers on the top but we don t like those since the dog can t get in and out at her leisure although in general it s a nice crate i probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers hence the two stars i am completely surprised that we only got three months use out of it before the zippers bit the dust we ve already purchased a different sturdier latch style crate that we re much happier with and we should have bought to start with,negative
appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and watch out for that hot plate burner it s a bit tough on the fingers if you weren t expecting the carafe to be heated basically this is a good coffeemaker just not quite worth the price tag for that amount of money i expected something more,positive
i use this desk chair frequently as a student i spend many hours sitting and studying at my desk the chair doesn t take up much space in my small apartment and it is comfortable and sturdy plus it was a great value so even if it doesn t last forever i am very happy for now,positive
do not buy this product it is not supplied with a parts list to order parts that may become broken if your call their customer service number everyone is very courteous however they want pictures of the power base \( front back top and bottom \) as well as a picture of the menu book they want all of this just to order a simple o ring gasket that goes on the the blender blade piece to act as a seal they will not sell you this item \( package of 4 for 7 95 \) without all of the above information as well as a receipt i find that all of this would be unessary if they would just supply a simple parts list dyanand,negative

searched for a long time to find a good quality espresso machine that didn t cost over 500 we had a great workhorse krups combo espresso coffee machine that was still working after 15 years was hoping this one would be the newer more powerful fancier model boy are we sorely disappointed the coffee part works fine unfortunately the espresso part leaks all over from the gasket and doesn t even produce hot espresso i exchanged this once hoping i just got a bad one but apparently the krups xp2010 is designed badly shame on krups for releasing a premature untested product,negative
i ve have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths they are also a nice large size so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they cannot be wrung out properly the colors of the towels are also beautiful i m buying more for our guest bathroom thank goodness i searched on amazon i don t believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else,positive

this set is so versatile i bought these because i own the red le creuset cookware and they matched them i thought that i would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard but the longer i own them the more uses i find for them great for appetizer containers for making mini casseroles \( or quiches \) creme brulee serving soup i ve even baked mini bread loaves in them the only recommendation i have is to buy two sets i usually end up using four at a time instead of two,positive
buy some rechargable batteries \( 4 aa s \) and you re set this fan has saved me time and time again at work when a hot flash hits just having some airflow around my face seems to help it s not a whirlwind but just enough,positive
i find it hard to give this even a 1 star given the price i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers here s why i am sorely disappointed 1 \) the stainless steel does in fact rust and corrode 2 \) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains no openings so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew 3 \) check your water softness because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly,negative

this is my first electric litter box i have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up it really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box it was a breeze to set up i also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats bathroom floor and with the tent they can t hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a bm on the floor i m going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down,positive

i rate this negative five stars i just purchased it thinking after reading all the reviews that it was great what a crock it s absolutely worthless it does not clean the water it s been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy the water flows and the motor is running the charcoal is in place but it doesn t clean the water i m better off with a bowl that i clean every day this thing just swishes around dirty water don t waste your money,negative
well after reading the reviews of this vacuum i decided to give it a try i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i didn t like i thought i d give it some time though and hoped i could adjust here is what i found 1 the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated 2 worse than the vacuum being heavy the darn thing is really hard to push even on hard smooth surfaces it s hard to push i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag for it to drag on hard surfaces it must be a design flaw 3 the on off power switch is foot operated not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i couldn t find it by looking down it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off unfortunately the damage was done the belt snapped how nice i really liked that first time out and the belt snapped another note about the switch there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it s a real challenge maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes hey dirt devil here is an idea how about putting the on off switch on the push handle what a novel idea doh 4 the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose the main reason being is that the hose it too short it s like you are fighting the hose all the time it gets tiring 5 the detachable hose is really hard to re install in it s port you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat 6 the vacuum is terrible on rugs on any of the floor height settings it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn t get all caught up i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it it jammed up every time 7 the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back i have to use the hose attachment 8 the vacuum is horrible on steps with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position easy deal the dirt devil does not work that way when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted one little problem with that the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking you don t get a good positive suction so you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position it often locks and so then you have to try and un lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth it s a joke the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops now for pros 1 the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up it almost makes my carpet look like new and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister some vacuums like to just tear up carpets 2 the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else i can t imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies maybe i ll be lucky and the motor will die soon then i ll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil steve,negative
i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is you won t bake a pie in it \( unless you make individual ones \) but it will be great for dips and sauces,positive
this is the best most beloved item in my kitchen i only wish i had bought the grinder and all the different cups \( which i am going to now add on \) i read some of the other reviews and at first i was also disappointed with this blender now that i have learned how to use it i love it do not put protein powder into it first it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup which you invert onto the blades \( when you invert it the bottom becomes the top \) if you put liquid in first and then the powder there s no problem you have to learn how to use it you will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick i read the reviews here before i bought mine and a woman said hers was junk but i went ahead and read the rest of the reviews and decided to buy it if mine breaks in a year it will have been well worth the price i use it every day and sometimes three times a day on a hot day when i want something slushy and cold i ll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice in a flash you have a refreshing drink it s fabulous i could use my cuisinart but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison there are no buttons to push you just fill the cup with your juice \( i often add protein powder \) and something frozen \( ice or frozen fruit \) and screw on the lid \( which have blades in it \) and put it on the blending base and twist you can either twist and pusle it or twist and leave it to blend on its own then you take the lid off rinse and that s it i love hummus and i will never make it in the blender because you have to dig it out and most of it gets left behind with this gadget you fill the cup blend it then screw off the blade lid screw on the refrigerator lid and that s it nothing to scrape just put it in the refrigerator \( oh yes you do have to rinse off the blade lid that s the whole clean up \) if you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend this is a great gadget i live in two places and i am getting another one for the other place but i m buying the complete set this time,positive
the humidifier started leaking after a few weeks in another website a few reviewers also had this problem the water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty very annoying the filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use it is also way too expensive,negative
i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz it does a reasonable job cleaning transforming my carpet from does she ever vacuum to oh she must have vacuumed yesterday it doesn t get all the fuzz and crumbs but it does what i d expect from a sweeper it is also much lighter than my vacuum so i m much more likely to use it my three year old daughter enjoys using it too she insists on sweeping her own room \( i won t complain \) the main thing i ve learned is that because the handle slides together it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle the sweeper will probably fall off so pick it up near the sweeper \( it stays together fine when actually sweeping,positive

my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker deliberately choosing one without a timer the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong right how can this company not even get the on off button right it s so cheap when you push it the lighted button just pushes right in and doesn t turn the coffeemaker off or on why didn t we keep the box and receipt so we could return it 20 down the drain don t buy this,negative
this vacuum cleans reasonably well but i have a few significant gripes which will prevent me from buying a similar model when making my next vacuum purchase which seems to about every 2 years i ve finally decided that we may go with an heirloom vacuum next time such as an oreck since the lifetime of any sub 100 vacuum is just ridiculous my complaints 1 this thing screams like a banshee it is indeed light and reasonably powerful but it literally hurts my ears to use it in small rooms it does not roar it emits a relatively high pitched scream i have had big small and medium size vacuums and this thing easily is louder than all of them i haev a 2 1 2 horsepower shop vac which is much quieter than this vacuum 2 wheels barely extend below the bottom of the vacuum so it requires a bit of effort to roll over anything but very short carpet wheeling from room to room say over hardwood while tipping the vacuum back also cannot really be done 3 the filter is hard to clean as it has a flange that extends down over maybe 1 3 of one side i often have to stick my finger in the space between the filter and the flange to get a significant amount of gunk out gross tell me how this is better than a bag,negative

being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons firstly there is no auto shut off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly secondly when using batteries they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries this light is also extremely fragile over a couple of years i went through 7 of these i would not recommend this light for the amount you spend on the never ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply and the constant new purchases after it breaks you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises \( available at barnes nobel come on and get it in stock amazon \) it is terrific it has a clock with an alarm and a timer you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes at that time you can extend the minutes if you don t do so for example you re sleeping it will automatically shut off it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light,negative

the scale does not come with a battery even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it all of this i can live with the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself when turned on it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds i timed it 40g for one minute \( and after hours just keep on going \) the box had no signs of damage so i m guessing the load cell was bad very disappointing,negative
ever since my curlers arrived i have been obsessed i love the curls i get from the larger size just roll your hair when you wake up do your make eat breakfast and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers \( very painless \) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials i love this product,positive

i read the reviews before i purchased this machine i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of so with this in mind i will put in my 2 cents i have had my machine for two months and i use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults a 4 year old and two dogs generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease the machine is set up to auto shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean freaks this machine doesn t quite hit the mark the water cleaning solution section is in my humble opinion to small i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up \) one more comment before i give my final review remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends there s a reason for this if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets so my final opinion is this if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it s a great time saver it s a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac up of dog hair scrub and mop any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment mop and bucket routine if you are a cleanfreak like me you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand and knees scrub no machine will ever leave you satisfied this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it s great i am giving this machine 4 stars because i think it does what it was designed to do light cleaning i would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i ll be all over it until then i ll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month,positive
i purchased four of these pillows i really shouldn t have wasted my money they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up i d rather sleep without a pillow at all,negative
as of today 3 24 i have not received this product very disappointed with delivery,negative
i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we ll have to live with the damage it s a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time,negative
lousy the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through i grate a lot of cheese and i am sorry i bought this grater,negative
a few times it worked great but mostly it brewed uneven i m not being a nitpicker here literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim there was no pattern to it sometimes it was the left one sometimes the right one sometimes neither filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging don t mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter it only took two days before i realized this was not worth the money or the time,negative
many times i ve come across great deals on amazon where i ve paid just little for a lot this is not one of those moments this pan feels like it s made from three layers of tin foil it s shockingly flimsy,negative
i bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores i hated having to shop around and wish i would have seen a set like this because i went from a queen bed to a king size i had to buy new pillows mattress pad comforter sheets etc i looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value plus much easier to buy all at once i highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress i was not able to buy the king size set but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift cheers ste,positive
i started to order replacement filters at 47 99 \( too expensive \) but found the whole machine was on sale for only 49 99 so i got 3 spare machines i ll be looking for one with a washable filter before those need replacement by the way they do remove dust and pollen and the like and i m happy with their performance,positive
this maker pours well and has a soft handle we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online nice little coffee make,positive
this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor the pur 2 stage dispenser specifically i found two main flaws 1 the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser as a result quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking even after tipping over the dispenser 2 even more infuriatingly the spigot s connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week i dutifully exchanged it for another one which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks it appears that the o ring that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator despite being a lifelong brita user i exchanged this product for a pur 2 stage dispenser i am now converted and will never go back the dispenser is rock solid and the water even tastes better,negative
these are a purchase to go with wamsutta sheets my daughter likes extra pillows these wash very well and are nice and heavy duty pillow cases are usually expensive for 2 99 at the closeout price i got a bargain,positive
i ordered this item because i know wusthof has a reputation for quality i find the kitchen shears sturdy and sharp especially appreciated are the easy separation feature of the blades for washing and the handy lid gripper for opening jars and bottles,positive
probably have bashed this product enough but it is insulting to still see sturdy lid and side handles for improved grip advertised in no time at all the handles broke off like peanut brittle glad i wasn t carrying it around the kitchen no wonder no one carries replacement handles don t know what s better but sure won t try rival again,negative
i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly at first but after only about 6 weeks of use the flip up spout broke off actually just broke in half i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good,positive
we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand \( they are made like hotel china essentially homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line \) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave they are both great never been disappointed with fiestaware,positive
i bought a haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months i called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one i have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing do not buy anything from this company their products are cheap chinese junk and they do not stand behind their products don t believe me look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and zero customer support,negative
i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon com and i absolutely love the rich cinnamon color of cinnabar the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal soup ice cream and leftovers \( smaller portions \) it s microwaveable too if you ve never used fiestaware before this would be a great introduction to the line especially if you have use for smaller soup cereal bowls,positive
i am totally dissatisfy with this product and this is damn waste of money brita base was working for just 2 week initially and now i able to get a water from filter but there is no light glowing either green or red the base was showing red flash light on end of first week for the first new filter which suppose to come upto atleast 2 months i recommed you all dont buy it,negative
this was very easy to put together and it holds a lot of coats great product at a great price,positive
whatever you do don t buy a shark it is a total waste of money it has to be the worst purchase that i have ever made you cannot contact the manufacturer smart move on their part their phone system would be overloaded with complaints,negative
usually break free product but smashed in amazon delivery and then had to wait 4 weeks for credit boo,negative
i bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture what a waste of my time and effort,negative
i expected better durability out of this fan it died after just 3 months and had flow problems from day one i tried contacting lasko but got no responses,negative
i am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the kitchenaid brand this blender is only one of several ka appliances i have purchased that only lasted about a year i don t use a blender much maybe once a month so when this died after only eleven months i was shocked kitchenaid was no help whatsoever my husband took it apart discovered that the motor still works but the on off switch went bad however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender after years of brand loyalty i am sad to say that i will not be buying anymore kitchenaid,negative
this item is not nine inches wide it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan but costs ten dollars more so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size hopefully the item description will be changed soon now i have to pack up and ship back several of these but at least amazon is paying the freight lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though i think this is just a random error just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7 99 the cornsticks will be the same size,negative
the lid drops in half the time you re trying to put it on the first six meals or so smell bad \( spoiled \) as they are cooking i think it s the sealing ring what a god awful smell for a kitchen,negative
it s pretty comfortable but what new mattress isn t the foam memory material takes a little getting used to i generally prefer a very firm mattress and had to get used to the sinking in feeling i ve also found you can t really use a lot of pillows what i like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns or gets out of bed you don t feel it the smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell but it isn t as obnoxious as it s made out to be but definitely present if ignored it will linger for about a month or so i didn t try to spray anything on it because it didn t really bother me that much over all it s a good mattress although not the greatest thing since sliced bread i m sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress and feel i ve definitely gotten my moneys worth i would recommend it,positive
product works well but i wish it moved greater volume of air runs 24 7 since oct 30,positive
sturdy well made spatula perfect for use in 12in to 16in woks for the price you just can t go wrong,positive
amazon is out of red after waiting for 2 months they shipped a white while the packing list states red when contacted they said that they do not have a red for replacement if i want a white i can get it elsewhere for 7 99 not i have to go through the trouble of returning it,negative
i read the two other bad reviews here and just bought 9 of these anyway i was stupid i had bought one in the past and have had it for a few months that one is great and has held up after multiple washings it is still so soft so i just didn t belive the two bad reviews i was wrong the bad reviews are correct i took these new 9 out of the box yesterday they are not of the same quality of the one i already have they are packed at least 3 different ways i think maybe some of them are someone else s defective returns i don t think these are first quality there are many snags there is at least one blue stain one looks like it was defective and then repaired sloppily the quality of the construction is not good some are soft some are rough i returned all 9 do not buy,negative
these sheets were the color size and quality described however if you tend to roll over instead of picking yourself up when you turn over while sleeping your sheets will very quickly begin to ball yes those tiny little balls you get on the clothes you wear within about 6 8 weeks the sheets have balls on the areas were the most friction happens they are otherwise great sheets but they don t act like egyptian cotton they are thick warm but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill \( soft twill mind you \) but they don t feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets i paid more money for pay for the real thing if you want soft non balling sheets,positive
i also have this fountian in black i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty the filters do not seem to last very long either i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one i do not reccommend this color at all the fountian has been fine until now but it shouldn t of broke down already,negative
of all my global knives i have bought recently this is my favorite i just love it it is very light and so easy to use and has so many uses and especially good for peeling vegetables one of my best buys,positive
i ve had this pot for over a year and love it fast hot great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time i bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because i loved the looks of it and there were limited choices at the brick and mortars i read all the reviews only after i bought it the reviewers major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking yes the plastic knob is poorly designed and is the only reason i give this pot 4 stars instead of 5 the designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob however it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot this is what i ve been doing since i bought the pot and i ve had absolutely no problems with the knob it s unlikely you ll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot so you can avoid burned fingertips a secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee i ve never had this problem i suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket or they are using the wrong grind it s important with any percolator to use a percolator grind or fac for all coffeemakers grind,positive
this is great it is very easy to clean just put it in the dishwasher you never have to worry about getting honey or syrup all over again it pours very clean and doesn t drip after you re done it looks very nice too great deal with a classy look,positive
this is a fine dehyrator it s quick and powerful the description says the trays are 13 5 inches but that text was lifted from the description for the fd 50 60 this model \( fd 1010 \) has 15 25 inch trays which adds almost one square foot to the area of the 13 5 inch tray multiply those larger trays by 30 \( the maximum capacity \) and you got a huge amount of drying surface,positive
i bought this oven recently it is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job all except the rotisserie when used grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full i was very dissapointed i contacted them via email today they say they will get with me in 24 hrs we ll see,negative
i used an avocado smaller than the tool so i had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it d fit then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell it made me realize that it s not that hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife oh well,negative
i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i couldn t use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that s all,negative
the stool fits under my kitchen table and is easy to move around i bought this stool for my 3 year old grandson he pulls it up to the sink when he wants to get a drink of water and he sits on it when he eats his lunch he loved mine so i bought him one of his own,positive
we love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff we love nothing more than our cast iron and lodge makes great ones at decent prices,positive
the slipcover barely covered my sofa will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside it keeps sliding off where i have to adjust it several times during the day if i could i would get my money back,negative
i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it s trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding,negative
great honing steel that is a bit longer than others i looked at \( seems to help a bit for the bigger knives \) and an attractive taper \( not sure that matters but it looks nice \) i ve only had it a brief time though i ve used it frequently despite an occasional clumsy collision this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks it straightens the edge on my \( mostly \) mid grade knives with ease another reviewer claimed the handle was plastic perhaps he was mistaken or perhaps he had a different version but mine purchased later has a visible grain if you look close under a dark ebony finish it does almost feel plastic due to the hard resin finish but it is the same material as on the shun knives a friend has \( though the steel lacks the metal endcap that her knives have \) aesthetics are open to debate but i think it looks much nicer than most and performs better than any other i ve used for daily straightening for less frequent light sharpening i recommend a diamond steel global makes the best diamond steel i ve seen but i ve stuck with the dmt for a quarter the price,positive
the step stool a gift for my daughter works well as a step stool the problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool the frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws there was a hole in the box and the screws fell out so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together,positive
aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the 4 setting it s pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it s warmed up \( keep it closed \) i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do sure they occasionally stick and i don t always get the batter in right and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it s on but this isn t a 100 device it s just a nice little waffle maker,positive
i went on a hunt for these glasses for a friend after our having beverages in them in a \( now gone \) bar in nyc i was delighted to finally find the exact glass at what i think is an affordable price for the quality i bought a set and we ended up splitting them \( he only wanted had space for 4 he lives in a small apartment \) i love them so much i ve now put them on my wishlist the beautiful clear glass clean design and impressive heft makes them feel elegant special and expensive i m certain the shape and feel make the single malt scotch i prefer taste even better an excellent value at less than 40 for six,positive
i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used \( and washed \) on a regular basis if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience give these a try,positive
evidently the people at krups didn t try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market the caraffe is hard to take out and put back in it scrapes the lid every time they say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer you need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee you never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups i m sure this is the last krup s product i will buy,negative
this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with i have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all it s so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors the only complaint i have is that the pads are hard to get on i have broke a few nails doing this it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this,positive
i have owned this type of product for years and it works very well this review is to warn others to think twice about ordering it from amazon they shipped the first one damaged then the replacement for the damaged one was much worse than the first one very frustrating and time wasting think about it its a plastic product that if not shipped packed properly is going to be damaged and will likely leak water i have ordered many things from amazon for many years and this is the worst result i have seen needless to say i am getting a refund and buying from another retailer,negative
this is not even a toy do not waste your money on this item amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a quick machine nothing about this machine functions well never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches amazon should not carry this item it has lowered the quality of amazon s products in my view,negative
i have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats and the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly,positive
in 1970 i was given a set of presto waterless cookware along with a pancake griddle at that time they didn t have non stick griddles through the years the handles broke but the grill fit over my stainless steel sink so no problem in 1999 i figured it was time to replace it with a new one i really loved it because it never stuck and once again i could rely on it in 2002 i started a pancake breakfast to raise money for our club it started with my presto grill and soon i added a second one over the next 18 months we raised 3 500 with those two grills serving pancakes french toast bacon etc my 3rd grill is still going strong and puts out our sunday breakfasts at home it is so refreshing to be able to depend upon the quality of an appliance these days thank you presto,positive
this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk,negative
i received these as a wedding gift not five of my tall glasses are broken and two short glasses none of which were from dropping them one broke as i was hand washing them and cut up my hand another literally broke as a guest was drinking out of it i was so embarrassed,negative
perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who don t like their food all running together on your plate good for snacks like pudding and jello also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing plus it won t take up alot of space on your table this is a very nice color,positive
i received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so i called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc i have since returned both pads in the same box,negative
just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us i should have taken more notice of the other reviews beautiful glasses but they are way too small my set will also be returned they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them,negative
my husband loves cereal for breakfast and i bought it so he doesn t have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal it was a perfect fit for him and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses i was surprised at how big it was but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful the rubber turn knob doesn t jam up as easily as i expected although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense only complaints 1 the top plastic covers are not completely airtight but are fine for dry cereal 2 the bottom rubber covers fall out easily they should fit more snugly,positive
like everything in the world this coffee maker is lawyer approved in other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee every day i have to warm my coffee up in the microwave,negative
i like the fact that it included diff sized containers and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot i have read reviews where people have burned out their motors and i will have to say that yes it s possible but only if you didn t follow the directions the manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient expect to shake things up once in a while between blends and this unit should last you at least a year d i think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it s thang gee if that was the case i d let my car drive me on auto pilot,positive
seriously for as good as their mixers are their knives are really really disappointing flimsy dull easily bent and broken within the first week of use our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later the steak knives are now following suit and the handle of the chef s knife has completely seperated from the blade gah don t waste your money,negative
one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i d much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there s no washing machine that s also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i didn t hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it s difficult to push and feels like it s gripping to the floor it doesn t fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it s big fat part vacuum head and when you re finished it s a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you re supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you ve finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i don t review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i m hoping that they will one day,negative
the fact that you don t have to rotate the trays like some other dehydrators is great we have made a lot of beef jerky since buying the snackmaster express it is a great product works great,positive
i have watched emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter i just dismissed it as part of emeril s shtick until i bought this machine for myself the first time i tried to use it with any liquid ingredients \( making mayonnaise \) it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl the top is just flawed in its design as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl i suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that ka did much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews \( e g consumer reports and cook s illustrated \) in any case this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry \( they blow through the badly designed joint as well \) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter the outside of the bowl the bottom of the machine and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do i will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the cuisinart i have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard,negative
great product at a great price the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item thank you,positive
i have had this product for 8 yrs before the internet i make a meal for my husband family every nite could hardly live without this product it really eliminates the need to wash dry measuring spoons and takes all the hassle out of making dishes with many ingredients at least you don t have to get a utensil out for measuring spices i have had this product in 3 homes \( i m a military spouse \) and it has been able to mount under the cabinets in 2 houses thus saving me valuable counterspace cabinet space due to the small kitchens in military housing i would highly reccommend this to those who like to cook in tight spaces every move i just empty the spices run the canister thru the dishwasher then set out to dry of course the labels had started to come off after 7 years so i simply printed out some new cutesy labels for those spices i constantly measure as i remember the labels that came with the package included most every spice you could ever want money well spent 8 yrs ago my hubby bought this for me it has survived a lot of cooking and moves,positive
this product is ok it s just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum the head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint catching fabric the extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast but for what it is this attachment is ridiculously overpriced,negative
this was my first calaphalon purchase and i am so impressed that i plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future this pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1 2 qt pans the unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food hand washing the pan is easy i love this pan,positive

very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room our dog a rescued border collie is incontinent so she cannot roam around the house and while she prefers being outdoors with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside in the same room as her family \( instead of out back in the mud room where her old wire cage was \),positive
this is the worst pan i have ever had we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap 1st the silicone smell was horrible 2nd the pan warped in oven i used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th the muffins did not come out i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck i will never buy silicone anything don t waiste your money,negative
i purchased this bonjour frother to replace my old aerolatte frother the difference between the two brands is startling the bonjour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually over froths the milk this causes the bubbles to keep breaking down i can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won t last long on the othe hand the aerolatte frothers \( also widely available with several models on amazon \) uses more of an open metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create i m buying another aerolatte and will use the bonjour wand for things that don t need thick foam \( like mixing salad dressing \),negative
who needs the high tech stuff this little frother couldn t be better it works killer within seconds it even works on my soymilk i m so impressed,positive

the written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5 yr old vornado models that are the best electric heaters i ve ever had the vh2 has major flaws it s single fan speed is way too fast causing heated air to be cool cold within 10 ft of the heater the fan cannot be slowed down the thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals thereby wasting energy i believe finally the thermostat is set so that when at the highest \( hottest \) setting it doesn t allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees f i ve had the heater 1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as i have an alternative brand in my home,negative

i have the black fusion in my home office \( which is next to a basement level theater room \) and my wife and i already love this machine we have tried all sorts of mixes and we ve only scratched the surface of what this machine can do this is one of the first times i ve been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it physical properties it handles travel mugs \( if you remove the drip tray which is largely unneeded anyway \) and all our standard mugs the drink head moves up and down so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks \( more common with frothy drinks than coffee and tea \) when it brews a filterpack it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out \( and thus keep it from dripping as you remove it \) the water tank could be larger \( if only because we re so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long \) but if you have a ready source of water nearby it shouldn t be a problem the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo \( which we also have \) flavor wise it s made by m m mars so you can bet that the sweeter drinks \( the so called indulgence fare \) is excellent coffee blends are quite good especially the darker roasts like french roast and sumatra lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks moreso than other chains clean up wipe the inside of the drink head and possibly the front of the plastic column \( the colored portion \) after any particularly splashy drinks no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug of course you can t watch its magic when the drink head is that low so your first few times you ll probably get a drip here and there final bits we ve had the senseo since its launch between pods that need pre wetting to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not so great varieties of drinks the senseo is lagging behind the flavia we drink coffee tea espresso drinks mixed blends and sweet tooth friendly indulgence mixes every day with the flavia and it s brain dead easy to use certainly easier to clean up after too if you re on the fence between the flavia and other single cup offerings \( like senseo \) get the flavia keurig and other single cup offerings can t touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia i m sipping a lemon blueberry tea blend now made over ice and it s fantastic highly recommended,positive
using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing and it requires a finer ground than what auto drip machines ask for after the water is brought to a boil it s important to wait for it to cool just slightly \( about 30 seconds \) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter wait for them to drain and then fill the pot with water want more than a single cup of coffee you wait for your first pour to brew and then fill the filter again some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing 1 taste i don t know how it does it but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter 2 cleanability users can keep all necessary components clean \( anyone who s brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn t there when you bought it understands this plight \) oftentimes the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it s not possible to get your hand into the reservoir some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot but if you re like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass then you need some good ol fashion friction to get it clean the best thing i ve found a baby bottle cleaner it s narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls too brilliant 3 electricity free as long as you can boil water you can have coffee 4 mud sludge french press and stove top espresso style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee don t get me wrong i think that s good \( i use a french press when i m in the mood \) but the cone on a chemex doesn t allow that at all 5 style size the chemex coffee pot is a relic \( designed in the 40s \) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it s a wonderful minimalist sight on any kitchen counter \( and unlike electric coffee makers easy to move if you need the space \) some drawbacks any purchaser should consider 1 time it does take 5 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee 2 cones you can t run over to wal mart when you use the last filter you need to find a specialty store or go online which means you need to plan ahead 3 cold coffee no electric hot plate \( thank god \) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop i think that s more labor added to an already laborious endeavor just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee 4 learning curve it does take some time to get the grind right the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue 5 cleanability i know this is in the advantages column as well but it s worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff \( which is a small pain \) else it will get nasty over time,positive
this is essentially the all clad stainless steel 3 quart saucier fitted with 2 short handles the dutch oven sold by all clad is a similar configuration of the 5 1 2 quart saucier this is a versatile stovetop pan wide enough for frying deep enough for liquids good looking enough to carry to the table it can also slide into the oven when needed it may not be big enough to do a traditional 19th century cassoulet with large hunks of meat and a gallon or so of beans as one poster complained but it functions quite well as an everyday pan for up to 4 persons the dimensions of 9 1 2 inches by 3 inches \( plus handles \) fit the 3 quart capacity into a compact shape with a rounded bottom for easy stirring if you are looking for a versatile do it all pan this is a good choice,positive

i got these knives as a gift ironically the first thing to rust was the part of each knife stamped stainless steel let s be realistic these knives are cheap they re thin and they re not well weighted however they say stainless steel and you figure that that s what you re getting i hand washed these knives and dried them immediately but they still corroded now comes the bad part i wrote to their customer service department twice and didn t hear back i finally got their address \( from the post office \) and sent them back the knives it took three months of me emailing and calling them \( with 15 minute wait times for each call \) to get them to send me a replacement set the replacement set rusted in about two weeks that was in september i just got off the phone with miracle blade a call during which i was interrupted so many times that i actually had to say i m going to finish my sentence so their rep would stop talking they won t refund my money in fact they won t refund anyone s money after 30 days the lifetime warranty is for replacement only they ll send me another set of soon to be rusty knives of course if i pay the shipping and handling again i asked the rep for his full name for his id and for a manager and he refused all requests in summary if you buy these knives they will rust you will want to get rid of them your only option will be the garbage can,negative

this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces however once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware you ll want to buy more over the years i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well known commercial cookware brand but all clad is far superior the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well balanced making them very easy to handle they heat evenly and cook uniformly even over low and medium heat i am very pleased with all clad s performance on my radiant cooktop i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance well worth every penny,positive
about a year ago i was looking for an espresso cappuccino machine that would be both great in quality and easy to use i also wanted it to look contemporary to fit the style of other things in the house on the other hand i didn t want to spend a fortune for some expensive brands that run up to 12 000 at that moment i was lucky enough to order from amazon breville 800jexl juice fountain elite that juicer impressed me so much that i was happy to buy breville s whatever which happened to be breville 800esxl die cast espresso machine it is reasonably priced for style and quality and so far i my husband and all our guests are happy with both espresso and cappuccino i only wish i could do more than 2 cups at the same time a year later i still think it was a great buy and it works as well as ever,positive

it makes the cleanest and purest coffee i have ever tasted i also use a moka pot a french press and a drip and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot to those who had failures and could not get it apart i have no idea what you are doing wrong there is little to go wrong fill the lower pot put on the upper pot with grinds in it heat it watch the water infuse the grinds remove from heat and let it go back down what is there to go wrong if it fails to go back to the lower pot there must have been a vacuum leak pull it apart and let gravity do it or just stick something in it and dislodge the filter if you are in a hurry there is no vacuum up top so how the coffee got stuck up there defeats all i know about physics just dump the stuff into the sink if it fails to go back through the filter it is pretty simple if it doesn t work for you i d call it user error try again if you can boil water this should pose no problem i have used it 100s of times with not one failure,positive
first off this machine looks great but unfortunately that s where the attraction ends you see i too used a little krups 45 espresso machine for years but it was a heck of a lot easier to use and made consistently better espresso cappucinno than this dog here s a brief synopsis the reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days i m constantly refilling it after making an espresso the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end making a mess of the whole machine the steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam the lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion and positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome did i mention the thing leaks now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino it doesn t,negative

why oh why did i buy this useless thing i have a perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13 inch screen which does what it is supposed to do namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners walls and floor is it perfect no but it definitely does most of the job which is what i can t say about the tovolo it has three fatal flaws first the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off i had to use one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid hot hot hot as i tried to wedge the handle under the screen s lip with my other hand second count the number of air holes in the silicone screen then count the holes in the metal mesh of the cuisipro or its ilk the purpose of a screen is to catch the grease and this is the important part to allow the steam to escape otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food i first tried using the tovolo to saute ground beef the beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen third too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat in all fairness the mesh type bows also but not as much possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable this product imo is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version save your money and buy the old fashioned kind,negative
ok this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds not minutes also it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil really its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge stupid stupid stupid design the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together its like a rubics cube a true waste of 40 bucks don t buy this it doesn t even look very cool,negative
the original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms this replacement filter however does not seem to wick water very well it can barely keep a 17x12 room at 30 humidity with the door closed windows shut and heat turned off and it s in the 40s not even very cold out in fact it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank i have to flip the filter every hour or so i called hamilton beach but they said it wasn t their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3m of course this is the only filter offered for use with this unit,negative
i love this little coffee maker i have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but i have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum this maker is made from stainless steel which is more expensive but for me it s worth it \( as it will probably last a lifetime \) it makes a very good cup of coffee and i m very happy with it also the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent,positive

i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife she loves it our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or for that matter on the box it arrived in the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me the knives are well crafted have a great feel extremely sharp and we love them there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other we also love the selection of knives especially the paring knife and small serrated knife some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we ve not noticed either of these conditions,positive

i ve had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest replaced it with a 20 mr coffee 4 cup from walmart which eventually let water out the front the back the side etc creating a puddle just like the leaky braun threw that out and went to a 12 cup hamilton beach that i had received as a gift what a pos it had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also the crap leaked as well and when i lifted it water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor after reading reviews on the net and countless hours of searching for a good price i was ready to buy the bunn stainless steel i almost bought the bodum electric santos until i read that for some users the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature anyway while at target i spent an hour looking at coffee makers including the bunn which i really liked b c it is made in the usa i decided to buy this one just to test it out i like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning \( which the bunn does not ahve \) and a timer which also the bunn does not have the carafe is not bulky and has a no drip mouth also i have not seen any leaks so far but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter perhaps i should just remove the filter and not the basket the problem with most coffee makers is the steam after it condenses the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body anyway i also like the cool blue light in the front and the coffee takes good or as good as my braun which is what i ve been used overall i don t think it s bad for 40 bucks if it develops a leak i ll go buy the bunn if that also sucks i think i ll give up coffee for i ve had enough trying to find a good easy no drip leak \( no punn intended \) drip coffee maker,positive

i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it i d looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior i broke a lot of rules setting this up its not connected to the hot water supply since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines also the machine is on the floor under the sink i bought new hoses to make the connections luckily the standard connectors on the back made this easy the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line and the drain can take a piece of garden hose i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water but so far its been okay \( if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home i might not be so nonchalant \) my unit was used from an area where there was very hard water and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill the heating element and the wash arm and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal and away we went since we are in an office we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over if you pop the door open the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise if you load this machine carefully you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much and the machine will operate more quietly we ve found that we can run the machine have the office radio on and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble my only complaints would be that on occasion the timer has gotten stuck \( once or twice in 100 washes \) also some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater capacity is very decent probably because the machine is pretty large measure first,positive

after the handle broke off the carafe that came with our krups aromacontrol \( after about 2 years of use perhaps several times a week \) i found this one and ordered it my belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off however i am perturbed that i had to go to the trouble of replacing it one would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components i am not entirely sure but it is possible that the plastic \( abs \) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured i searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem which is at the same time comforting and annoying upon receiving this carafe i was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it i prefer a certain heft and i assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made however this has proved not to be the case moreover the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing further i think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe \( inside \) on this model the advantage of this is that the coffee pours better \( a tighter stream not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe \) however i it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult in all it is superior to the original however i am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off i assume that they have fixed this problem in this model however i cannot be sure of this i also must say that it is a tad over priced and that perhaps might be a more reasonable price the only reason i did not get a new coffee maker is that the aromacontrol works well and makes good coffee \( i use illy \),positive

what a failure seemed just right for a simple way to make a quick single brewed cup of coffee small low profile and uses little space on the counter the science is so simple and established that i figured there could be no problems wrong it cannot deliver more than 6 ounces of water through the system even though the water well holds 12 ounces if you drink more than six ounces \( smaller than a juice glass \) of coffee this is not the unit for you the well is filled with 12 ounces and the machine starts to brew good then about half way through the process \( very slow \) it simply stops i used my own 12oz mug which fits well but the pot seems pooped and just keeps on heating the water without delivering it through the plumbing i have plunged the small water hole in the bottom if the well with no results i ve tried it five times wasting coffee and time and it simply doesn t want to work i m planning to use it for a planter small cut wildflowers will look nice for coffee i m going to a real working product it doesn t pay to return this item because the time and postage will make it too expensive this is junk pure and simple,negative

took the pan home and promptly fried a steak on high thereby causing an apartment full of smoke and a pile of burnt crud on the pan including a large stain seemingly impossible to get off tried everything including the company s recommended bleach method no luck then i tried baking soda as suggested in one of the reviews here and it just simply wiped away the damage like new then i set about reading the instruction booklet and have had great results using low heat it s really a different way of cooking but the fried stuff comes out just as if i d used high heat on another pan stainless steel s great too of course but this is a worthy and earthy alternative i take the perspective that the ceramic layer gives the pan a solid foundation for the seasoning process,positive

this machine replaces a semiautomatic delonghi which i thought was decent well after using this for 3 weeks i can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent the titanium is a wonderful machine not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great it s fully programable and once set it s just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso every time it warms up in under a minute has a large bean hopper large water resevior very cool blue lcd display i can t rave enough i ve had no problems at all with this machine and i recommend it heartily,positive
i gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months even cut through chicken bones but just like the other reviews the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment i used these for making chicken soup alot but noticed that it also doesn t always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken i like to be extra careful so the next set i get i ll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from henckels this time,negative

i purchased two units one for our home and one for our vacation home within a few days the unit at home was no longer making good crema the water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses i m sending both units back and buying another brand if they had worked properly i m not sure i would have like them even then the design of this unit is odd i ve had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird if you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew the grounds and steam explode all over i also suspect that the thermostat is broken it allows the water to boil which does not make tasty coffee overall i hate this unit i m going back to shopping,negative
first of all the item is too small it is about 1 3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1 3 as wide so as you can see it is pretty small so it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again it does not make life easier good in principle but does not work,negative

i purchased this for a betta fish which was a gift for my cats this model was perfect because the lid screws on which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish there is a small hole at the top so you don t have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish the aqua gems cover the bottom but i added some gravel for additional covering also the aqua gems are light and you lose some when changing the water so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually the one negative i found is that the light is basically useless it illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly other than that i m very satisfied i did look at petsmart for additional oxygen stones but they don t sell them not sure if those are really necessary though,positive
wouldn t you think that the manufacturers of a wine rack would measure the bottles of wine before designing the rack apparently not in this case after purchasing 3 of these racks i discovered that about 10 of my 200 bottle collection doesn t fit in the grid holes it was understood that magnums weren t going to fit which was no big deal but when over 20 bottles end up sitting on the floor because they are about 1 8 to 1 4 too large in diameter i get a little irritated especially after paying over 300 including shipping the overall quality of the product is average the racks were not straight along their length and had to be tie wired together to keep them in alignment,negative

there s nothing worse than having to find space for and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop and because she s on the countertop you will use her she works great will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling i tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me she poaches four eggs perfectly and here you can use jumbos if you like the water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done adding more or less water the next time will take care of that actually the first time i poached jumbos i found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste i added a bit more water to the cooker plugged her back in and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute when the water evaporates she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing \( as i am \) i love this cooker first one i have ever owned and because she looks cute sitting on the counter i don t forget i have her therefore she gets used alot,positive

i really enjoy cooking in this pot it has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes the enamel surface is wonderful i love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family the only drawback is how heavy the pot is but that doesn t change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen,positive
this far exceeds any similar bowl so what if the other reviewer has to flip this thing 3 times to get his her heep of sugar personally i replaced my sugar bowl spoon server so that my children would not over do it on the sugar in their morning cereal the product feels and looks great and functions well i ended up buying another one for my work location it is super easy to clean and the fact that it is of simple design makes after use clean up a snap,positive
i had this blender for 3 4 years and was very unhappy with it the design is poor \( liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured \) the motor seems weak and it is hard to clean food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable today after only sporadic medium duty use over the few years i had it my blender outright died i have other cuisinart products that perform very well but this blender is a loser,negative

my daughter needed this item for an event and the wrong item was delivered by then we were under a time crunch so i talked to customer service but there was no way target would expedite shipping the correct item to arrive in time i had to order the item from another supplier and pay for 2 day delivery in the meantime the online pathway for getting a shipping label to return the wrong item lets me spend time putting all the information in but then shuttles me to a try again screen i try half a dozen or more times and give up an hour later i try again with the same dead end i email customer service to just send a label by email but have yet to receive a response the next day i try again with the same dead end i have wasted a lot of time for something i don t even want i think i will let my credit card company know to not pay and let the supplier ship me a return label when they get around to it can you tell i am not impressed with the service,negative
i was originally going to buy clickclack \( made in new zealand \) storage containers to save money i bought these \( china made \) containers instead and it was a big mistake the first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers the soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed the clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks the final straw came when i dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off rendering the container useless for airtight storage and that s assuming that the somewhat loose fitting lids actually make the containers airtight if you want containers like these spend the money on clickclack or some other quality brand i m surprised target sells these at all,negative
after using my roomba for a year and loving it i decided to splurge and buy scooba wow i think i love it even more than my roomba i turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it when i return i have a gorgeous shiny clean smelling floor once a week i wrap a damp washcloth around my swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny all the time scooba is a miracle i did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box i had to prime the pump to get it going my only suggestion to irobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming scooba in the box instead of making people go to the irobot website to troubleshoot obviously from reading the reviews you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem fortunately that s the only trouble i ve ever had with it i ve never had to prime again and it works flawlessly i m very impressed with scooba,positive
i wanted a dual coffee espresso maker thinking i would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence but i was totally surprised how easy it is to use and now it s lattes every day also there was almost no learning curve my first cup \( surprisingly from what i ve read elsewhere \) was near perfect and apparently it wasn t a fluke if there is any drawback it s only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe \( but i m sure a purist would scoff at such a notion \) if i have one recommendation it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe \( or whatever it s called \) to steam your milk i m not a physicist so i m not sure why but it does make a difference in summation this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice \( i give it 4 stars instead of 5 because i have to grind the beans and it didn t include an intravenous unit \),positive
the detector was simple enough to use although it required alot of batteries \( 8 \) but the results were mixed urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances even in areas where i knew there had been an accident it was difficult to spot the difference all in all i generally wouldn t recommend this \( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom \),negative

it doesn t zap the yap of our newly adopted pomeranian mix although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it but it didn t slow her down much we did everything according to directions and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact we have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well i m disappointed with this bark collar though,negative
i bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs it works for a while then stops working or just goes on warm they replaced it three times everytime it went out this seems to be common with cheap rice cookers see the reviews on the rival rcs 200 they all go out within days or weeks i guess black and decker and rival used the same chinaman to design these useless things i can t understand why amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do not work the companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately in frustration i bought the aroma 60 cupper for 125 and after two months that also went out any suggestions on a 20 cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated,negative

we bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months i thought if i upgraded a bit i could get a bit more milege out of it like maybe 2 years but now with only 5 months of usage suddenly no power totally dead it is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center aren t too outrageous we ll try that route other wise looks like another waste of money i have to say that while it did work we enjoyed it it was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven and made great bacon in the warmer a bonus we weren t expecting update to this review i sent in to warranty center and they replaced it with a new one it took a while and then they sent the wrong item \( same name different product honest mistake \) but were very very nice when i called and sent the right one out right away now just hoping this one lasts more than 5 months,negative
okay i haven t used this while reading in bed yet but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting it s great the light isn t good for areas that are adequately well lit so don t bother to use the light there but in areas where light is dim the light shines literally it casts a bright light on the page \( s \) that you need to view it s helped me tremendously get through pages of reading yes it s a bit pricey for what you get but it s incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go the power adapter however is a cumbersome brick as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for i can t offer an estimate of time yet but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so cumulative not consecutive hours so no complaints yet about that whenever i saw this light online or in the store i used to think why in the world would i ever want something like this now my thoughts are why didn t i ever think to buy this before,positive
i baked six loaves in this machine i have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don t turn out just right my big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time \( 70 minutes \) my loaves were only marginally acceptable they were not sufficiently baked i was using a nearly whole wheat recipe the machine was quiet strong and had a lot of bells and whistles but with only partially baked bread i had to return it to amazon amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back and were quick enough with the refund,negative

i purchased a krups thermal replacement pot for an electric coffee maker about two weeks after i bought it i made coffee one morning only to discover the coffee running all over the floor for no apparent reason the glass inside of the thermal pot had completely shattered i will be returning the pot this week,negative
i bought this coffee maker with great faith in the krups name willing to order online without the touch factor i was sorely disappointed while the concept seems promising the actual product is a failure the carafe is awkward and you have to fiddle with it every time to pour your coffee and the handle simply came off after just 6 months of normal use \( a m coffee only \) and there is no way to fix it as the bolts are lodged inside and can t be accessed an expensive mistake and to think i d looked to krups to solve my problem of having to replace coffee makers every six months or so don t waste your money and i personally will avoid the krups brand from now on,negative
i returned eureka 437az back to amazon i was very dissapointed when i ve tried to vacuum my room the vacuum is powerful but flow of air comming from the front blower is so strong that it disperses dust all over and prevents proper vacuuming in the cosumers report eureka 431 green vacuum cleaner is not recommended model and now i know that these two vacuums are practically identical the only difference being color and hepa filter another downside of this vacuum is that the dust acumulates over the filter which then is difficult to clean,negative

for quite a while i had been looking for a certain type of dvd rack tower then one day in target i was looking at the mission collection and saw the box \( no display \) it is exactly what i had been looking for slapped on the two foot ends and done perfect fit for dvds 20 fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy dvd cases like the ones new line cinema puts out you can fit more i don t have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one dvd per slot i have many oversized ones the hardwood is great too just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall if you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then it is worth it i am almost ready to buy a third one soon,positive
when i first saw this dehumidifier i couldn t stop laughing this little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed i figured that something was better than nothing until i could buy a better \( bigger \) dehumidifier i hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little bitty sucked up an inch of water in one night now i am so confident that this will do the job i will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem the free shipping was a great plus as well,positive
we had a press made by singer that finally gave up the ghost after more than 10 years after a several days of ironing clothes with mixed results a lot of frustration we researched presses on amazon based on customer reviews we decided on this press and have not been disappointed the press is ready to use as soon as it s out of the box operation is simple all but self explanatory and it heats up very quickly it is a little smaller than our previous press but not so small as to be a drawback clothes are ready in no time compared to ironing the press comes with a water spray bottle if you prefer not to use the steam feature definitely worth the money spent,positive

this vacuum worked the first time i used it but that was the only time with the amount of noise it makes you would hope that it would be removing dirt from the floor however what it appears to be doing is using its rotating bristles to redistribute the dirt in a thinner more homogenous layer if you are looking for a machine to use as a sound effect prop for a jet engine this is the one for you,negative
i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews but it isn t so hot the light isn t very bright and quite diffused and the light sensor isn t sensitive enough it stays on in all but the brightest light i ordered two but have only opened one and the other is likely to stay in its packaging,negative
this swissmar fondue set is excellent i love how stylish it is i looked on amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do cheeses broths for meat chocolate flexibility is what i was looking for the 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with when done with that course remove the ceramic bowl pour the water out of the copper pot and put in your broth although i haven t used it for chocolate yet i m sure it will work well for that using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir of course if you re into the tradition of swiss fondue cooking the thick part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest the burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another i have used also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course you will need to refill it between cheese and broth of course make sure it s extinguished and cool before doing so i used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store an excellent purchase i am very happy with it,positive

my wife and i have used this machine for several weeks now we found it to be a great machine for the price others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands so i immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other american vacuums now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on this thing is lite strong and easy to empty the cord retractor is a little lite so i wouldn t be to rough with it garrett and susan,negative

this lamp went together with no problem the pieces fit tightly and the lamp stands perfectly upright it is more brownish than reddish but i believe that it can go with many colors especially pastels the design color and simplicity make this a very classy lamp the slate shade is gorgeous and much tougher than i thought this lamp as most lamps is not made for grabbing and moving too much put it where you want it and enjoy it s beauty buying this lamp is a win win situation,positive

i personally haven t heard a peep about silverstone in ages and frankly when i bought this item i didn t even realize it was made by them i needed new muffin pans so i just looked for the best deal price wise i saw this set and figured it was as good as any when i received them i was ecstatic when you think of something relatively trivial like this you don t really expect much in the way of quality but man was i wrong these things are weighty very well constructed and have durable written all over them i consider it a huge upgrade from my old flimsy no name tins and i highly recommend them for anyone who like me bakes a lot and really just doesn t want to worry about replacing these kinds of things too often,positive
i just want to say i am not sure why the person who lost a piece of the product in her \( dawn ulepich dawnski337 \( illinois \) \) haste is criticizing the company for a bad product i have only had one problem ever with a rival product and when i called the company they immediately sent a new product out to take care of the problem even though it was not a product problem but rather a handling problem i have found that they are a more than fair company and will take care of their customers they probably would have even taken care of replacement of the plastic part \( even though she lost it \) it is not fair to penalize the store from which it was bought or the company that produced it because of her carelessness,positive
i liked the price and all the different stitches however i needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things such as alterations and heavy sewing i m very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine the needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread also the food feed stalls jerks and surges this machine has beautiful stitches but is for lightweight sewing only,negative
i like this type of opener very much and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing so i opened the package and tried to open a bottle of wine but the corkscrew would not lock i m not even sure i ll send it back given the warranty hassle shipping costs etc given the price i just can t recommend this brand to anyone,negative
i have been in love with the set for years they are versatile sharp and reliable each piece has its own speciality and the whole set satisfies all your need for kitchen endeavor i personally like the vegetable chopper and the curved bone chopper best,positive
i am a very experienced user of innova innova is i guess you can say is the parent company of ultrex which is a line of nonstick cookware innova is not know for quality and this product is no different there is a 25 year warranty on the ultrex i had mine for 6 years and the nonstick coating is off you can return the product for another but yes you have to pay for the shipping and if your pot is oversized you have to pay ups or whomever to make you a box and thats another charge the customer service is not world class i had to wait almost 3 months for a replacement the workmanship is horrible the product is made in china however i ve had other things made in china that were of great quality so i don t know what is up with innova i suggest that if you find a product made by innova avoid it save yourself the aggrevation this product doesn t deserve 1 star,negative

i really like this bookcase it is attractive and easy to set up simply fold the shelves into place although it is easy to set up it is pretty sturdy there are spaces in the back that items could fall through but there are wood slats to hold books in place i also like the size of the bookcase it is not too wide but holds a lot because it is tall and the mission sides are nice,positive
i planted these last wed it is now tues and i think by tommorow i will be able to harvest they grow so fast you can t believe it when i wake up they look like they have grown so much by the time i go to bed they are even bigger it was very easy to plant and all i do is make sure they have water there is a chance you can get mold but i have not had that problem i will buy more from this seller i am looking into the mushroom kits,positive
i threw out all of my old tupperware cups that my kids were using and switched to a supply of fiestaware ceramic cups now that my kids are all over 5 we don t need all that ugly plastic these are durable and attractive a range of colors lets them keep track of which cup is theirs plus it matches my other dinnerware it s the perfect size for them when they get older and need a bigger glass these are perfect for juice,positive
i received the shams and was suprised with the colour these are almost a mustard yellow not what i would call sunlight the picture shown reflects a lot of light thus looking paler the quality looks to be good and i did wash and iron them they do look good with my bedspread \( a blue laura ashley floral \) and pick up the yellow in it for the price i think they are a good buy it s nice to have a change now and again,positive

in the twentieth century and before cast iron pans had the size stamped on them which told you the diameter of the cooking surface twenty five years ago i bought the lodge 10sk which is a 12 skillet with a 10 inside cooking diameter ok with this skillet marked 14sk the inside cooking surface is only 12 and it should be marked 12sk they deceptively flared out the sides to get an overall top diameter of 15 1 4 as a selling point this isn t very helpful to my pork chops being 36 less space than i thought i was buying i d watch out for the 10sk too i guess to get a real 14 cast iron skillet i need to get a griswold hilditch ps it weighs 10 lbs,negative

i bought this canister vacuum about 2 months ago and i absolutely love it it is quiet and i told my husband i swear it picks up the dirt off the basement floor from our living room i love the automatic rewind cord the cord is very long and i don t have to look for a plug in each room i vacuum i have all hardwood floors and two cats and it really keeps the hair volume in the bag the wands are sturdy metal i have gone through about 3 vacuums in the past two years due to plastic parts breaking thank you electrolux for the quality build of this vacuum the only thing that irritates me is i can not keep the attachments attached to the bend in the wand i finally gave up and put them in a drawer since i seldom have to use them spring and fall cleaning will be the only time more than likely i also wish the vacuum wands would stand by themselves when i have to leave the vacuum for one reason or another but it is still a 5 star even considering those two little things,positive
i got this to replace my bulky turner that i got from the dollar store for 1 00 for an extra 3 or so i got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me also the turner part looks plastic but i guess it s silicone or something because it does not melt also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat if washing by hand its easily washable too i have both the blue and green flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen,positive
one shouldn t have to empty water out after every use one shouldn t be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice that is not a functional teapot if that may be the case though it is the prettiest teapot around it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime but the enamelware can t even touch the quality of the cast iron cookware fortunately the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement see www lecreuset com for details,negative

the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know that i would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop when using the wet mop it will leave water lines where i stop therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels when using the vacuum my liquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks i have not recommended this product to anyone a waste of 100 00,negative
i ve had my vacuum for a few years now only b c i m too lazy to buy another one however i am at the end of my rope from day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently and most of the time i was vacuuming on hardwood if i accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb the belt broke i took to buying lots of extra belts whenever i went to the store the other day surprise the belt broke for no apparent reason i promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute i turned the vacuum on i say no more i am now determined to buy the best vacuum ever i don t care how much it costs the only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose attachments without having to flip a switch and it is pretty powerful but that s it changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers i frequently run over the cord something just wasn t designed right there you ve been warned,negative
i recently purchased this double boiler and i am very happy with it it is a good quality stainless and that is important i love the vintage style it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape much like one that grandma had many years ago the boiler insert is 6 deep not counting the lid and perfect for making frosting candy custard anything that requires gentle cooking,positive
christmas morning and the slow ongoing leak which we worked around over the last year finally gave way and voila hot coffee and water and grounds all over the counter and floors and yes we clean our coffeemaker daily and yes we know how to properly run the thing too \( we gave up on the water filter soon after purchase it kept falling into the coffee grounds \) why the two stars we wanted to love this machine we wanted it to work it is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree \( a mr coffee \) the clock is nice the thermal carafe is lovely until the big leak we made do with its daily dribble and sputter but really after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did that s why i ve bothered to write this review it is not an inexpensive machine the quality isn t there sorry,negative

the concept was great but after only a month or so flaws started showing the inserts started bending and warping seperating at the edges and cracking i purchased them for my mother who gave them to my daughter as a gift she loved the idea but will go back to the wooden boards because i don t think these will be around long and they were not cheap either,negative
i got this for our 3 year old daughter s room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night i wouldn t rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room the top and back do get hot although you d have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned bumping into it should not cause any burns i haven t noticed any odors or noises from it,positive

look i suck at using a normal iron but after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on dry cleaners the results are pretty good as i have gotten better using it the results have gotten better plus there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others i just did a couple of long sleeve dress shirts and the results were good not perfect but good as others have said i wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with but once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge isn t really a big deal more height clearance would be nice though it won t be too long before it pays for itself and now i have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled plus i m pressing my golf shirts which typically didn t look that good after being washed but were too expensive to get dry cleaned i also just ironed an undershirt just for fun now that was an easy shirt to iron,positive
this was the first item that i purchased on amazon item was received in excellent condition and in a very timely manner very pleased,positive

to us typical fiestaware pieces have great design color durability and functioning wrapped up all in one we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with straight candle results even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product specifically the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform a kind of softer look in the color application around the rims on plates for example and the piece will still look beautiful we don t want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces,negative

this was a lot of fun its big and different from my golden s other toys and it makes a really unusual sound not a squeak but a honk if you will the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog s short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan,positive

do not be tricked into buying an easy sharpener they do not work spend the same money \( or less \) on a good stone set that has various angles \( i e lansky w 17 20 25 and 30 degree angles and 3 5 stones use 20 degrees for your slicing and paring knives and 25 degrees for you chefs \) i opted for the stone set \( i m a bit of a purist \) but i ve heard good remarks about the diamond set too the 3 grit set is all you really need coarse medium and fine get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such with proper care and light steel use \( it s the re aligning tool not the sharpening device be gentle \) you ll probably only need to touch up your edge once every year or two depending on the work load you put on your knife but if you do seriously muck the edge up you ll have a system that can repair your knife to good as new condition my chef fell onto the tile floor point first and i had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later the normal touch up takes less than 5 minutes per blade and at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened you ll be ahead of the game after the first use hint use a 5x magnifying glass loupe to inspect your edge by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source you ll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened you can also take a look at your edge before using the steel and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel and see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives i admit i have a couple myself in short get stoned not taken,negative
i bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers i did not succeed i paid 50 and could have bought a 20 mr coffee and saved myself a lot of my money this is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features it has no clock no timer no automatic turnoff \( it will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off it is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back it is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles you are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing in a word don t it just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element and it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee i am not an engineer just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go this coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace if you want a basic coffeemaker get a mr coffee for 20 this is not what you are looking for there is nothing deluxe about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me,negative

the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer be sure to understand this before you buy so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it think again the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality not at least not on premium quality photo paper perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore this is hint 1 hint 2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol the only option you have is to order the ink online trust amazon as they can find and deliver however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges cartridges certainly dont last very long and at 12 15 each with eight of them your burning 100 125 a set bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you however at 850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper i haven t been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon amazon s being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here,negative

you really can t go wrong with this one not great response but what do you expect for less than 300 on the other hand the possibilities for this surround system are endless want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system \( this is how my daughter has it configured \) it s our second one first one died as a result of recent electrical storm \( yes the circuit was protected but so what \) couldn t be happier for the investment,positive
this cartridge is very light easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality durable black ink on the page it is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that s great \( it even comes with an expiration date \) hp also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit one thing that i didn t like however is that the ink can go quickly if you print a lot you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so my needs are about 20 pages per week and i have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks that s not good although to be fair to this hp ink cartridge i am printing graphics four stars \( well maybe three and one half stars \) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge it loses points for not lasting longer,positive
i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle they are were very uncomfortable from the start but i could listen to music that didn t last long the connection would not hold and if i didn t hold it together the music faded out also music faded in and out from ear to ear i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less,negative
i must admit i read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive however i found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items i ve tried so far i initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time \( before reading the instructions \) this made things more difficult so i started over set it for everything to be automatic including the time left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its thing which it did magnificently everything worked beautifully and it did a great job i love the one touch recording i found it s best to read directions one at a time as i want to try something new and have had no problems so far i haven t tried everything it will do but find it s very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use it s a joy to hit the tvguide button highlight the shows i want to watch and hit the record button so far i have no complaints,positive
after ruining another pair of over the head headphones i decided to check these out they are actually on sale at 50 off and i ve just tried mine out the audio is very sharp especially with the base though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair i can just increase the volume to compensate at 35 this is a great deal they feel great the band that most headphones have presses down on your head but not too much it also folds down quite nicely though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress haven t tried out the actual noise cancellation feature but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent then it will work just as well it also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your mp3 player if you so wished however it easily fits into a jacket pocket great great great design and comfort,positive
my wife dropped the original remote and it quite working it turns out there are pcb s inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so i resoldered it and it worked for a little while probably until the next time she dropped it i bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also could not find the problem this time it still transmitted but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on i unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and i could not start the truck i messed with it \( while in the parking lot of an amusment park \) for a long time and evetually got it to stop probably by entering valet mode i m not sure don t waste your money on another 100 remote i am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the lcd should be more reliable my suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes one lcd and one simple better yet buy a system that does not have the feedback or 2 way and save a lot of money and headache you won t use it anyway,negative
this review is more about the hi md concept in general than one particular player the sound quality was excellent the rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace complaints the only thing that isn t proprietary is the headphone jack and the aa battery beyond that sony s dual role as a content provider \( complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers \) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players no macintosh support is just the beginning proprietary compression algorithms weird and twisted upload download rules wrong choices made at every point of the prd process 100x recording speed make that 4x on a good day 100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of elliot spitzer if he only cared the players are flimsy just walking with mine caused it to skip and one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely sony will charge you to honor the warranty \( parts only no labor \) by contrast apple replaced my daughter s ipod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups trying to find hi mds offers the thrill of the hunt if you re into that kind of thing but their rarity suggests that sony is at best half hearted about supporting this device i used to be a loyal sony customer but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing in fact i m planning an hd tv purchase next year and have sony far down on the list of possibilities you can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days howard are you listening,negative
i ve been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming pc and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool i had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until i bought this after shuffling my pci cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 ultra i fired the machine up \( and closed the case \) and did some gaming all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card this fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5 7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore once the chaos on the screen starts to subside the cooling is even better as an added bonus this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game i thought for sure that i would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and i was surprised to find that i had to listen for it in order to hear it about the only complaint i have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back \( which i knew when i bought it \) so it is not temperature sensitive still deserves 5 stars though,positive

it works fine but it gets really annoying when you re using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16 9 aspect ratio whereas macs are at 16 10 aspect ratio so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you re trying to display or have massive letter boxing after three months i still haven t had any glitches that were this adapter s fault if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector don t bother with this go straight to dvi with a mini dvi to dvi adapter then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord,positive
my criteria for my new printer purchase was 1 11x17 2 individual inks 3 reliable printer company 4 easy installation good customer service 5 price \( this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice \) so far for my needs this has been a great printer so far it does great quality prints for photos school projects and more i wanted to have more versatility to make posters labels photos etc my last hp wide format printer \( 1200c \) lasted for over 5 years and i took it everywhere i have only had this for a few motnhs but it hasn t been a disappointment yet,positive

i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i don t have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it s the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2 0 sd mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i m very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future,positive

hello i purchased the avic d2 xm and the ipod kit from amazon i then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup after 3 5 hours they failed i decided that i d return the items because i needed to get an alternative gift before christmas and i didn t have time to find another way to get it installed i was able to return the d2 but the gex p10xmt and the ib100ii are not returnable it turns out that amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies had i realized that amazon would sell me something that i can t return i would have purchased elsewhere at this point i will never purchase anything else from amazon ever again,negative
after all the hype on line about the t amp i had to check it out for myself all the reports are true this is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price if you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it this amp is for you you will not be disappointed i recommend purchasing the ac power supply as well you can find others cheaper but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the t amp remains valid,positive
this linksys stuff simply doesn t work and don t try getting technical support it s a complete waste of time if you can t google the solution just take the stuff back the adapter install took out my tcpip stack even for my wired connection it took me 3 full days to figure out that i needed to remove any sign of linksys odyssey and funk software from the registry then remove and reinstall the tcpip stack linksys support couldn t even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days a dozen emails and 5 separate phone calls linksys support is just embarrassing don t be caught having to depend on it,negative

i ve rarely had bad experiences with microsoft mice or keyboards usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product they evidently didn t hire the good designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults 1 the shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever this causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it you never get the feeling that your hand is in the right position 2 the side buttons are in brain dead locations why this is i have no idea as other microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly \( the way it should be \) on this gaming mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it couple this with problem 1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn t intend to just what you don t want when throwing a grenade the right button is sort of click able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button but it feels more due to luck than planning i have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street i give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord and it looks visually appealing calling this a gaming mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of rating not recommended,negative
good product forget about service i e mailed infocus about my faulty projector 8th january 2005 it is now 7th january 2006 and i still do not have my projector that s right it s been one year since my projector stopped working i have given up on it being repaired \( it was under warranty \) and am now struggling to get it back so that i can repair it out of my own pocket check this company s record at the better business bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints,negative
after owning a p touch labeler for years i found the need for a more duable label than my m tape was providing i opted for this tz tape labeler good price looks good what a mistake the only thing well designed about this unit is it s abilty to waste more tape than it uses if you print a label of any size count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it at 20 00 a roll prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button then go find the scissors and cut the excess off so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk but cheer up you can push six buttons every time to reduce the margin to narrow this will reduce the waste to a half inch on one side of the label and print two small dots on the other side this will show you where to cut it with your scissors to match the narrow side also you must do all settings for every label every time another great feature it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size so you will only print large print what a joke what a hassle now the good news i used to make lots of labels and now i only make labels for very important items and only when i am up to getting mad for doing so i really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars you have been warned,negative
i ve had this printer for four years i print approximately 25 documents each week this is the first time that i have had to replace the cartridge it s a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time too compared to ink jet printers that i have had i get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets great buy,positive
i wish i had read the problems and netgear com forums before purchasing this product huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily this requires you unplug and plug back in the ap in order for it to stay visable to your computers second problem i am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 3 5feet from the ap the unit is around 11 36mpbs do not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products all of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in india people on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke latest firmware fixes none of the problems,negative

i recently purchased this as a replacement for my monster cable i must say that i am quite impressed this is the best fm transmitter i have encountered i live in seattle there is a fairly saturated fm dial and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals that said i only have minor problems with interference the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges functionality is pretty much seamless in my car i drive a 2003 ford focus the 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash cd changer so accessibility is not an issue if anyone is in the market for an fm transmitter for their ipod i highly recommend this one that ll do pig that ll do,positive
this product looks and feels very flimsy do not be fooled by the flashy metallic looking picture the plastic shell of this device is the quality of mcdonald s toys one would think that for 300 the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting the buttons are hard to press in order to turn the device on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell the cable port for the docupen is also extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connection will be lost i am a pre medical student and i very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product believing that i could \( for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk \) scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way i thought i would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least 100 each however i now see that this belief was naive to say the least the docupen is extremely difficult to use the words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free paper port software which comes complimentary with the docupen is rather useful for annotating pdf s the docupen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate furthermore downloading is very slow \( at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer \) and since you can t see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to re scan about 80 of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility i wish i had read some of the other negative amazon reviews before buying this product i would have saved myself a lot of money and time if you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital camera will probably deliver better results if you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all out paperless with this product you will find yourself extremely disappointed until planon decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi decent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy the idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a tablet pc however the execution of the idea needs improvement i hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality,negative
i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered this receiver does have a number of good features but has one serious flaw it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations like volume and sound mode unless you have a pioneer display and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv \( as a side note pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display \) that means you only get to see the simple set up screen on your non pioneer tv which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver and very infrequently after that \( the set up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs and audio calibtraion \) sounds like a small deal but in many home theaters including mine the electronics are not in the line of site \( mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything \) this not uncommon many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors and it means i have no idea what the volume is what sound mode i am using or anything beyond the set up menu unless i go into the closet bad bad bad this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv s and projectors and it is beyond stupid if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher but it is a serious flaw it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult this limitation also means if you have mulitple displays i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater you need to run thier special cable to both displays and both have to be pioneer again i have to say bad bad bad the other features are as stated on the pioneer website but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems unless they have a pioneer display with sr \( oh yeah your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr thier way of linking the two units if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr you are again out of luck did i mention this is bad \) 25 feb 2007 addition to reveiw i called onecall and they will take unit back but at 15 restocking fee plus paying for shipping both ways while onecall really did nothing wrong \( pioneer is lying about the osd \) it is one of thier vendors and not the customer s fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud buyer beware from onecall thier customer service on this one was not good,negative

i purchased this gps back in april of 2006 and have been very happy with it since it is not perfect but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker gps it s a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises in the car it is accurate and maps routes quickly 90 of the time the other 10 of the time it either looses signal has outdated maps \( my update is ordered and on it s way as i type \) or just slow processing for some reason of this 10 of the time i d say only 2 of the time has this been an actual problem for me the rest of the time i was able to simply guess what i needed to do next or it didn t matter at all i have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations but the vast majority of the time this hasn t been an issue on foot one of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof both qualities needed to be used for hiking the only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads otherwise you will get some really confusing directions also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses but it can be done \( put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route \) on boat haven t tested this as i don t have a boat and haven t purchased the water based maps overall i m very happy with this and looking forward to the map update i wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points it s still better than buying lugging around 2 seperate gps systems to me,positive

i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player doesn t work it s essentially useless this is a complete rip off at any price point,negative
the only thing i will say about the bdp s1 is that it is top quality picture and sound quality are top notch but everything really depends on the software now if you are undecided about which camp to follow \( blu ray or hd dvd \) i m here to tell you that blu ray will win you see i have both blu ray and hd dvd i have about 20 hd dvd movies and about 20 blu ray movies in terms of picture and sound quality they are the same but it is completely dependant on the software but here is where the similarities end 1 \) blu ray is more durable the bd movie discs have scratch resistant coating they don t scratch unless you forcefully scratch them on the other hand the hddvd movies scratch like heck i put all of my movies in a cd case i recently noticed that all the hddvd movies are scratched but none of the blu ray movies are scratched these are stored in the same cd case by me i am extremely careful none of my movies even have a fingerprint on them so when i see scratches on 100 of my hddvd movies that really upsets me 2 \) blu ray costs less to buy what superman returns bd is 24 superman hddvd is 28 the departed bd is 24 the departed hddvd is 28 now the hddvd dual format has both a standard dvd and hddvd movie but who in their right mind would want to buy an hddvd to watch a 480p picture right now you can get a 500 ps3 or 400 toshiba hddvd player later this year sony will come out with a 300 blu ray disc player hddvd will most likely drop their prices so the hardware will cost the same in both formats 3 \) blu ray has more capacity for less money you can get a 50gb blu ray movie versus a 30gb hddvd movie and what if in 5 years they develope super high definition 1920p picture and super hi def 8 1 dts hd sound what if this requires 75gb or 100gb hddvd can go up to 51gb peace,positive
i bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous 60 at circuit city out of dire necessity i have never liked monster cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers i opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection at their usurious price point i find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore i would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations thanks to circuit city s return policies i was able to return this junk and get my money back caveat emptor cable buyers spend your money wisely and stop the monster cable insanity,negative
i m not sure what i expected after i purchased this for fifty some odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a 40 rebate but i wish that someone had informed me before i lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesn t come through the speaker i m cool with the machine s sound quality when it comes to playing a cd g if i tap the mic i can hear an extremely faint thud so i know it s on but the volume s too low and yes i adjusted the mic controls if you want to sing along which makes this a dinosaur a boom box in the age of the ipod really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn t been opened so when was my first clue doh,negative
i purchased one of these just shy of three years ago \( feb 2003 \) i have taken very good care of it \( it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use \) and used it several times a week while i teach over time the silver finish wore off around the on button \( apparently from perspiration from my hand \) exposing the copper underneath last week the button froze in the on position so it is now effectively useless the laser diode still works however also the company offers geek points for future purchases that are supposed to be good for 36 months i checked the site earlier this week and while it s now only been 35 months the ones i earned from this purchase are no longer on record,negative

i didn t want to fork over 500 for a bose or boston acoustics or even 350 for a cambridge soundworks and then i found this little gem for about 175 shipping i ve had it for a few days and so far i am impressed the sx functions are very intuitive easy to set the time and both alarms i thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the cd player compartment no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm the alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated which is great the buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them and the cd am fm tuner and aux buttons will glow when they are active the volume control and tuner knobs are recessed but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges i suppose the snooze sleep button is a good size the sleep function can be toggled for 90 60 or 30 minutes the range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the sx the speakers measure about 2 5 inches and with the volume turned up you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit i like that it has adjustable bass and treble which can vary from 5 to 5 i have the bass set to 3 and treble to 2 and it sounds great it doesn t have the range of say a home entertainment system but definitely rivals my sony bookshelf system the mp3 player on the sx could be better but is adequate during playback the lcd will scroll to display the filename title artist and track it can be programmed for up to 64 tracks but i haven t had the time or patience for this instead i just numbered the mp3 tracks in the order i wanted before burning them to the cd rom the repeat function works well and you can choose either to repeat one track repeat all tracks or repeat just one folder however the shuffle function is rather limited as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an mp3 from any of the folders \( resulting in less than desired combinations of music \) and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once one of the things i looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini jack and it also has a jack for headphones i have my laptop on my nightstand right now and it playing mp3s on winamp sound great plugged into the sx there are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit lcd the default level cannot be changed or dimmed and is rather bright in a dark room it will make everything glow takes a little while to get used to but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight i guess it is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small and the brightness of the lcd can kind of drown out the analog display but then again i wear glasses so i suppose i have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes when the radio or cd player is in operation the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower default level with the dimmer button on the remote control one other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup and you will notice this is the case with many japanese units including the sony clock radios i guess the power grid in japan is really stable so they don t have use for this but still it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery on the other hand i was informed by teac tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for up to 3 hours i haven t had the time to test the maximum threshold but i can say that i did unplug the clock for about a minute and when i plugged it back in sure enough the time and alarms were still correct overall i am really impressed by this unit the only thing that could be better is if the mp3 player shuffle had a few more options but i guess this is ok as many i have seen mp3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all also i wish the lcd backlight could be adjusted a little more it is a bit pricey at just under 200 but i have heard many clock radios and you would have to spend 350 to get anywhere near the sound quality of the teac sx,positive
after installing the card i booted up my windows xp and it locked up after rebooting again however the card worked fine and has continued to work fine i ve only had the card for two days and so far i am very happy with it here s my setup windows xp home edition direct tv set top box and a standard cable from the set top box into the card since the set top box is in the other room i m just using the set top box remote to set it on the right channel a little tedious but it s fine for recording a few shows i haven t tried the remote that came with the card \( i assume it doesn t work through walls \) the wintv 2000 software is not very user friendly but i haven t found any bugs in it yet i chose not to install the software and drivers from the cd instead i downloaded all of the latest versions directly from the manufacturer s web site,positive
i must admit the first review posted here on the d320 made me a little nervous my experience is quite different and after several months of ownership i am quite pleased i ll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review as that s the only point of reference \( so far \) 1 \) yes pick up a usb cable 2 \) printer driver installation on win98 essentially required no user intervention with winxp however i do seem to recall having to muck with it more but i m hazy on the details now 3 \) i have printed scores of multi page documents many over 15 pages without any problems whatsoever i ve had no spills or jams of any kind 4 \) i have not seen any paper curl problems whatsoever 5 \) i leave the paper cassette lid manual feed slot in place at all times as i have no problem with it for doing many two sided copies it is indeed easier to place the copies back into the paper cassette but that s my experience with any copier i ve used 6 \) making two sided copies is easy and as efficient as i expected i ve simply experienced no problems 7 \) i ve experienced no copier caused misalignments if my copies have been crooked it was because i set them on the glass improperly i am very happy with this unit it copies as i expect it to and prints just the same quickly and without event it s been able to properly print from all windoze applications i ve thrown at it and ones many users may not even be using such as ghostscript acrobat securecrt paf and all image viewing software i ve tried and i ve got several machines networked together \( win98 and winxp \) that can all print to the d320 fine using printer sharing btw the d320 comes with a full 3500 page toner cartridge too not a starter unit as with some printers copiers,positive

i had an optoma h27 but felt it was lacking the brightness i liked on tv and i heard that hd72 was much better so i returned my h27 to costco and got the hd6800 which is costco s version of the hd72 wow much better hardly describes it the brightness is incredible and the detail and colors are truly remarkable the other night i was trying out different dvds just to see what they looked like on the new system and i was totally blown away while it does upscale dvd images to look better on its system i also bought a sony upscaling dvd player and there is a significant improvement with it with the hdmi connection i had read that since they are both upscaling the dvd player s upscaling wouldn t be necessary but i do find the image through the upscaling dvd the best in a side by side test using two sony dvd players and two dvds of the recently restored carousel using component s video and hdmi at the same time all connected to the hd72 i saw clearer detail on faces coming from the hdmi upscaling dvd player i was so impressed i felt like pulling in people from the street to see it but i fought the impulse because i don t want to share it with anyone with a little tweaking of the menus new films like star wars iii and sin city showed incredible detail and older films like the adventures of robin hood were gorgeous in their technicolor glory i highly recommend the hd72,positive
this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference but to see the beam \( not just the dot at the end of the beam \) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of,positive

having had very good luck with two belkin g routers i thought that the g would be a no brainer not first of all the router would not install at all from windows 2000 i called customer support and after interminable waits and two tech support people \( who were very polite \) we finally decided to install from another computer with windows xp all seemed to be going along fine the router installed but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set up process like their g router setups did only when i logged on wirelessly it let me set a password meaning had any of my bandwidth thieving neighbors tried to log on before me it would have been them setting my password \( which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless \) it also came without a user s guide \( though that is listed on the box contents \) and the cd rom also was supposed to have a user s manual but when i clicked on the user manual tab nothing came up after all was said and done i did manage to get my xp system connected but the windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable \( it was working fine on a linksys direct cable before \) overall a very painfully long installation that was not windows 2000 compatible \( or perhaps a firewall problem \) items left out of the package and a big step down in ease of installation from their g router and if that isn t bad enough the signal strength was no improvement over the linksys g router i was replacing belkin sorry this product was below your previous standard this one s going back to best buy,negative

this item is br1500 which also called rs model vs the bx1500 called xs models external battery br24bp can be used for both br1500 and bx1500 the capability to connect external battery is great since that can help reduce the downtime when california experiencing rolling black in the summer there are basically 2 differences between the back ups rs \( br1500 \) and the back ups xs \( bx1500 \) models besides their names 1 the back ups rs models have both 1 line 2 wire phone fax modem data line protection and 10 100base t ethernet protection where as the back ups xs models only has 1 line 2 wire phone fax modem protection 2 the back ups rs models have both boost and trim as features of automatic voltage regulation \( avr \) where as the back ups xs only has boost when the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a back ups xs model it will only go to battery avr boost the ups is compensating for a low utility voltage while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low avr trim the ups is compensating for a high utility voltage while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high bx1500 does not have the avr trim feature when ac line voltage is higher than spec it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range please note this is called backup ups not the smart ups line backup ups does not produce pure sine wave when power lost it will take some milli seconds to switch over to battery power smart ups produces sine wave and the output ac was from dc source all the time when ac input lost the ac output will not have any interrupt for most computers the backup ups is good enough since the power supply inside pc always have capacitors that can hold for about 100ms or longer when backup ups switched over in about 20ms the computer will continue operates without much impact but for a v equipment this may be an issue especially the output is not pure sine wave i would not recommend use this ups for a v equipment,positive

seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal price wise it was great however it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well the directions are terrible they are extremely difficult to follow i never could get it to sync with outlook i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child s play in comparison in this case you get what you pay for don t purchase this you ll be sorry take care it s a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen ad nauseum do you carry the manual with you put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the english language truly disappointed with this worthless plastic,negative
i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups and the last 5 or so failed i thought it was my software so i got new software guess what my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed too it s not my burner \( as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read \) as it s brand new and doesn t require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i m buying some now and save myself the frustration,negative
i ve been using these earbuds for several months now and they re far better than the ones that come with the ipod they re more comfortable and there s so much more bass although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once and they still sound just as good as the day i got them \( i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together though \) i thought i d certainly destroy them by getting them wet but these things are industrial strength,positive

i bought this item because amazon never had the 3m model i wanted in stock so i settled for this one that was a big mistake the wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu it is really a two person operation finally if your cpu has a side access panel you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer take a look at the 3m cs100 stand i think it is a much better design,negative
it was time to get a new cordless phone and i bought this because it was on sale and featured hard number buttons i find it more difficult to dial phones with soft squishy buttons bad decision you can t hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices and apparently no one can hear me i plugged in my headset to the jack and they can hear me but i can t hear them there is static everywhere you can t use it in range of fluorescent lights tvs computers speakers etc in a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere try that this phone is worthless and if i can return it i will,negative

this vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad s new tracheostomy problem is it puts out too much mist even at the lowest setting we ve tried everything including taping the hole but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through of course it wasn t until we started mentioning it to the various rn s that come to take care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem so i ve resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad s mask not a great way to do it \( and just asking to be seeded by bacteria \) but if anyone has a better suggestion i m all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier,negative

i ve had this phone for approx 9 months now maybe longer and i truly don t know how i ve stood using this dual phone system for so long however tonight i ve taken a giant step upward towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx tg 5432m dual system this dual handset is the worst i ve ever experienced in a cordless system from the moment i set it up the static has been atrocious step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear i can t even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting not only to me but to the other person on the other end for they hear it too i will never purchase another uniden product if this is the non quality of product they put out i had a 2 4 mhz system that would outshine this system and i wish i d never gotten rid of it as the title says if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head uniden should be ashamed of this product stepping down from the soapbox now,negative

good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device my major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and i would not use it it is just right and great protection for my 1955 by the way i replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen it is a great piece of protection,positive

i bought this mouse about three months ago and i love it it works on every surface and the scroller works well too the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short \( about 2 5 feet long \) and it plugs into the left hand side of my laptop which means that i only have about a foot to work with although i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left \( good deal for the left handed population i guess \) some people have complained about the wind up function for the cord getting tangled but i haven t had any problems with that,positive
great item picture great sound great connection choices great one problem being located about a foot away from an under cabinet radio the presence \( shut off \) of this tv produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio to eliminate this sound you must unplug this tv from the power source or optionally move it at least three feet away which in our case is not practical very curious,positive

i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all 4 500 of them are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd s the player just wouldn t read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer service tech department of any computer electronic company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a 3rd or 4th language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can t believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2 3 days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don t plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1 2gb file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up 7 1gb after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i don t like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because 1 it plays all my music 2 they have a customer service tech support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff,negative
it s a good phone works well i like the caller id function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone makes them easier to see use it has good sound a ring tone that doesn t jangle the nerves the only problem i had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone one must use the cord that the phone comes with rather than one already in use i purchased an adapter so that i could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack not a big deal in my book but one i didn t learn about until i got the phone overall i am pleased with it,positive

i bought this mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a 200 dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service don t count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product,negative

this printer is a piece of junk the print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges the mechanism is likrly to be damaged like other hp printers operating under xp it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem \( e g paper jam paper out \) cancelling a print job results in a deleting document message which remains until printer is disconnected \( you can turn it off under these circumstances \) and computer is rebooted often xp hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering i have long had this problem with an older hp model but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now but alas the crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge the tricolor cartridge costing about 18 at wal mart lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up in sumarry don t buy this printer whatever the price it would probably be wise to avoid hp inexpensive printers altogether,negative

i live in an apartment building and play \( well practice is a better word \) the bass guitar and needed headphones so i wouldn t bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs tv about 6 feet from where i sit and play the 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing so i wouldn t have to use an extention cable \( and usualy end up with feedback distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable \) the volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so i don t have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings i like to use when not using headphones makes it real nice too when using an instructional cd or dvd i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head very light weight some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them bobble heads fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere cord enters headphones on the left ear side so you don t have to deal with the classic y split cord easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way earpices fit nicly over my ears \( no pinching gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear \) and does a very nice job blocking out noise \( when my wife is awake she watchs the tv rather loudly which is right next to me and i bairly notice it \) plenty of padding around the ear pieces many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear but these headphones i honestly don t feel anything against my ears even after several hours of use each night sound quality bose or pioneer they are not but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn t be shopping in the 20 and under headphones \) that being said they are very good for sound sounded very good on a portable cd player only drawbacks i can see is that a person with large tall ears won t get thier ears covered by the earpads the inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1 4 inchs tall by 1 3 4 imo they could have been made bigger also if you have a tall head \( good distance from top of head to ear \) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears i have a head like drew carry \( give you an idea head size shape i m talking about \) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn t have fit i wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don t interfere bind pinch or anything like that with my glasses so i highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after \( i don t recomend things often \) \),positive

as a musician who s dealt w opening many cd packages for many years let me save you some money you don t need a special tool to open cds just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid rough surface \( like a sidewalk or concrete wall \) a couple of times the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie allowing you to take it off effortlessly getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy too again no tools required you ll notice that the cd cover is hinged at the top bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back it just pops in out held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top bottom then bend the whole thing back toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed so that the sticker becomes straightened out this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece \( try peeling the front cover off the sticker rather than vice versa \) and you re done all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy the whole process takes under a minute and you ll still have the money in your pocket that you didn t spend on an iffy cd opening tool to buy another cd with,negative

after enduring the so so performance of my stock ipod headphones i figured it was time to step up as i travel constantly i wanted something that would would block out exterior noise as a music freak i wanted something that would sound great after countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get \( ue vs shure vs etymotics \) i bought the super fi 5 pros in the end it was the price amazon was selling then for 90 less than the msrp can t beat that as soon as they were delivered i hooked them up and put them on they aren t kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down i keep the volume on my ipod way down a fraction of what i kept it at with the stock headphones the room i was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement with the ues on it was just me and the music a fire engine thundered by normally a painfully annoying experience again the ues reduced it to the point that i didn t realize the fire engine was coming until i saw it drive by as for the music i first played a couple of tracks by jenny lewis and the watson twins i immediately noticed elements to the music i never even heard with my other headphones jenny lewis angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like i was listening to them for the first time next i put on some ray charles with the ues it was like i was there in the front row the horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while i discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section i ve read complaints that in ear headphones don t produce enough bass so i decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from siamese twin by the smashing pumpkins while i m not by any means a bass head i need some bass to enjoy rock albums i couldn t have been happier with how the ues performed the drums in the album \( which i ve always considered some of the best \) came alive the guitars actually had some balls but didn t overpower the singing or drums as is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time your ears are bound to hurt a little i found this to be the case only for a day or two after that the ues fit snugly without any complaint the only weird thing i encountered had to do with ear wax my wife an audiologist forbids the family from using q tips so after taking the ues off for the first couple of times there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones like the discomfort this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times i used the ues and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue when there are so many excellent products out there finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging i ve never tried on shures or etymotics so i can t compare the performance of those headphones and the ues what i do know is that i got a really great deal on the best headphones i ve ever had without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones i will buy for some time,positive
i m not the most gadget inclined person and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use but i have to say i ve had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out it s either off or on but there s not much gradation between the two in fact i get almost no gain at all until i reach almost the 3 00 position on the dial and then it s a lot and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation it basically keeps me locked into soft close singing and a girl can t do that all the time other than that i haven t had any problems but that one almost renders it useless i don t know if there s something more reliable \( and sane \) out there but if there is go for that instead even if it costs more why spend money on something that doesn t work,negative

i like this printer there a few minor quarks but it s fast and the prints come out good the one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight if it s lose it will start making bad prints it takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out tighten it and start printing again i am also using this with the mac osx os though the device says it will only work with pc and mentions something about the casio cw utility for use on a mac but no where on the casio site could i find the mentioned utility after some searching i cam e accross this this allows the cw 100 to work fine on a mac though i have never seen the pc software that comes with printer i have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options this is enough to get around since you can make a jpg version of your label put that in the print area and print away the jpg can be what ever image text you want resolution is great too i print at 300dpi all in all i found this to be a great purchase i make music and do not have the money to send out to have my cds done this print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost great the diyer,positive

after looking around at the local stores \( fry s and compusa \) i had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my ipod in multiple environments on my belt and also in exercise and had resigned myself to having a skin type case for just everyday use and then shifting the ipod to an arm band for exercise not a particularly great solution expensive \( around 20 for each \) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses then i ran into the dlo action jacket at best buy which seemed to cover all my intended uses unlike the prior reviewer i found my 40g ipod fits very snugly absolutely zero slop and i really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case also at 29 95 it s cheaper than the two case approach the only criticism i have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case the process is a little tedious but the end result is great the unit feels very secure on my arm and it s easy to forget that it s there this jacket is a winner,positive

pro compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket yet opens to a comfortable working size with full sized keys including a number row for those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets this is decidedly a deal maker over the stowaway keyboard which requires alt key combinations to access numbers and symbols the full size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the freedom keyboard to my knowledge there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has both full size keys and a number symbol row the bluetooth connection is clean lag free and accurate con the software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement \( see below \) flimsy locking mechanism not usable on a lap the manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat while on your lap or on a non flat surface this lock is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip which travels 7 8 along the top of the board from the left half into the right even when locked the keyboard doesn t lay flat and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user s legs held in place only by one thin piece of wire the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated v shape after any amount of light handed typing hp could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics a user must find a solid flat surface to type on such as a book and of course when sitting on a flat surface the lock isn t needed the manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your pocketpc unfortunately the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non removable cradle a quick look at the freedom keyboard s pull out cradle offers hp a lesson in how to do it right the keyboard ships with no case as do most other portable keyboards with non rugged exteriors the attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys it doesn t turn off yes you read that last bullet correctly you can t turn this thing off there s no power switch the button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld it s not a power switch what this means is even when folded and not in use even when appearing to be dormant and even when the software shows that there s no bluetooth connection the keyboard is still eating your batteries the automatic sleep mode simply disables the wireless connection it does not power down the keyboard two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard you ll return to find them dead not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes the only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries the battery cover need i add breaks easilly sound unbelievable go to the major websites dedicated to pocketpcs and do a search of their forums using the keywords bluetooth keyboard this is not a case of a know nothing customer who needs to read the manual the manual such as it is makes no mention of an absent power switch for the mobile user then in addition to the keyboard itself one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired to carry the batteries separately and to re enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use the hp ipaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1 3 it s 100 retail price and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full size keys and number row how hp ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me all potential buyers of ipaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what if any emphasis hp places on quality of design and the integrity of ipaq name it reflects also the degree of respect hp has for the intelligence of their customers one might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non removable cradle or the parsimony of not including a case one might even forgive the useless locking mechanism but when hp is either too dumb to include an on off switch or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care then i must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the ipaq name if hp is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for 100 then i cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a pocketpc for 300 400 my next handheld upgrade i ll probably stay with fujitsu siemens loox \( i currently use a loox720 a truly excellent ppc \) or maybe go with a dell axim i won t even consider an ipaq the hp bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality those at hp responsible for protecting public perception of the ipaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves,negative

i purchased 16 of the allsop 26625 dvd vhs organizers after i had 4 or 5 of them on the floor loaded with dvds i was going to move them to load the next batch but when i picked them up off the floor two of them came apart dropping the dvds on the floor knowing they were weak i tried to hold the next one together but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners the other two corners gave way and my hands came together scattering dvds all over the floor looking at the pieces that came apart i saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece but the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the dvds facing upward and they were the same on all 16 boxes i emailed the manufacturer \( from whom i had bought 12 of the boxes \) and asked since it would be time consuming for me to send them back and costly for them what would they offer me if i just kept them and glued the corners together i had absolutely no response i ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them i think they will be ok now but i would not have purchased them if i knew they were so poorly manufactured and i do not have any good thoughts about allsop s customer service,negative
the shape conforms perfectly to the designer s hands but unless you share the same dna i d avoid this product i ve used many of these over the years and this is the only one i struggled with constantly shifting it to get it s high and low points in a place that was tolerable i finally reversed it pointing it towards me and it worked a little better this just needs to be a simple pad instead they ve overdesigned it as a gimmick,negative
while i m driving this thing doesn t work at all there s tons of static and the music cuts out all the time the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still maybe it s because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can t reach it overall i d say this product is garbage,negative

man were we diappointed with this ge phone we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we couldn t figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a 10 year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it s unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere,negative

i bought this product to hang a 42 lcd i am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns the mount is only 32 wide the virtual axis tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me there are only two tilt options with this mount vertical \( hugs wall nicely \) and the 5 degree being 32 wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16 centers make sure you get at least 2 studs my experience is this mount does not support vesa 400x800mm pattern 800mm is 31 5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than 30 apart my tv did have another attaching pattern but i had to use the m5 bolts \( provided with mount \) i would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where i could use the thicker m8 bolts a 42 lcd isn t going to weigh as much as a 50 tv so take that into consideration i am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy,positive

i just received these and popped em in and i m listening to mp3s on my pc at first one of sides was really weak in volume in the process of testing the balance in my software i accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys but that apparently did the trick now both are equal and sound good there is decent bass but the highs are a bit soft a quick tweak to my equalizer and they re great after reading several of the reviews on amazon i was a bit worried about the sound but now that i have them i m very happy they re a good price and sooooo much better than the little ipod like earbuds i ve tried before those never stayed in my ear and the bass never made me happy summary these jbuds stay in my ear have good sound \( not great but i think good for 20 \) and have equal length cords from each ear,positive

this cable looks nice when you don t linger on a digital channel what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight the next day it will be a split screen mode showing double image of the broadcast to fix it i have to change it to a non digital channel and switch it back i guess it is possible that it is the cable box but nothing happens like that on the component outputs,negative
when i got my hands on the pmc 120 i thought this was going to to be the best player but when i started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way i agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation device feel to it music when i tried to put music in my pmc it syncronized my mp3s with the wmp 10 with no problem \( very fast \) if u are looking for a grab and drop \( copy paste \) your music mp3 device this is not for you because when i did it got everything in one same folder that read unknown artist and album so you have to put all your mp3s via wmp 10 wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast the problems that i encountered is that it only has one portable playlist and sometimes when im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button one cool thing is that it shows the cd covers without having to put them in this is done via the wmp10 the sound is very good and crisp and the equalizer setups are fair but you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound pictures this is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders you can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a pc to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you video ok now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me i wanted a portable media device that i would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid i knew that this device only reads wmv but it supports divx xvid mpeg etc this support deppends on what the wmp10 can play so this means that you sincronyze \( via wmp10 \) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into wmp movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your pmc secreen size i had this in mind when i bought it and was fine with me untill i tried it the first time the wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that i had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the wmp10 so after uninstalling and installing i was good to go so i converted a 1 45hr long movie in only 25 minutes but this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the wmp10 fits the widescreen movies into the pmc and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable you cant change this because the wmp does this automatically my answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into wmv files the problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert i have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the wmp10 in the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the wmp10 and it does it very fast and with good quality you can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so i think this option is useless on the pmc so the veredict is the pmc 120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches it is a little bulky but personally i think the size is not that big i think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3 6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video if you want to play directly your divx or xvid movies on your player buy another porduct like the iriver pmp series or the archos players wich are way way way more expensive so i think that for the price and for what it does the pmc 120 gets two thumbs up,positive

when it worked it did as described but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it there are many better more reliable brands such as the sony micro vault which i have now nevertheless i wouldn t put anything on these that i didn t have backed up these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer heat will cause them to fail faster,negative

the sony mdr if3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear perhaps if one were an elf or a small child they would fit properly however if you re like me a mere adult mortal they probably won t fit you they would be okay for simple stereo listening but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description if you re looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie the sony mdr if8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money,negative

i am very happy with my meridian color and the other mapsend products i have purchased however at first i couldnt get this product to work i had no problem getting this software to run with xp \( even without the patch \) however i couldnt view the basemap i had loaded onto my magellan i tried to address this with the company it has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails customer service for this product is nonexistant i joined the yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer turns out i just had to go to the menu card utilities and maunually select the basemap i did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do i cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though navigating through hungary like a pro i didnt miss a single turn i would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it the magellan meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps get you head out of your a thales you have some great products but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support i recommend anyone with a question about softward or the gps join the yahoo groups and post the question there dont waste your time with customer support,negative
i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company,negative

i bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new hp dv2000 laptop with internal bluetooth i was excited about the instant view feature and the lazer percision however when i got the mouse connected it worked but no instant viewer turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the dongle pluged in but the reason i bought a bluetooth mouse was in order to avoid a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop on top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are awkwerd to press i have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them nothing like my old microsoft mouses cozy side button the middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three which is set to activate the amazing instant viewer which is decent but useless without the dongle as far as lazer percision not too noticable my kingston rf lazer mouse seemed to preform better the only reason i gave it a 2 5 is the charger is nice the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish which feels nice and cool against the palm this makes a decent desktop mouse if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice not something i d recomend for a laptop user for the price overall subpar,negative

i have purchased over two dozen of these units this is the best unit for the price there are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit this allows you to be certain that your feed is being input also the card slots are a plus two things to be aware of if you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in also if you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required not a one disc does all unit,positive

not only was this difficult to set up \( even a generally polite but sadly ill informed technical helper from belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases \) but once i finally managed to get it to work \( by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip \) it had practically no range whatsoever in fact my macbook pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75 signal and once the threshold of the room was crossed the signal disappeared altogether a free four year old linksys router which i received with my earthlink home networking package \( and which this belkin was supposed to replace \) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed and linksys is supposed to be notoriously mac unfriendly anyway i hope that there are enough ups trucks in america to handle the returns that this item mine included will require,negative

my 2 year old saw this in bjs and kept asking for it so santa brought it for him for christmas i think it s a good first guitar he loves to strum it but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument not a toy so far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it s held up fine but i don t think it would hold up with such continued abuse it is recommended for children much older than he is so i can t expect anything different i do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him for a better price than i see at amazon you can get a small hohner guitar at a music store which might be better quality i m not sure regardless i am very happy with this guitar and i would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music i would not buy it for a child just as a toy unless you don t mind it being destroyed i am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when i get it,positive

this was my first gps system of any kind i wasn t sure what to expect i have a small mazda miata so i wanted a small screen gps that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint i was afraid that the screen would be too small but it s perfect i don t think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space i live in new york city and before putting it in my car i walked with the gps unit in my hands perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal i was convinced it was defective it s not once i put it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes this unit comes with a 128mb micro sdcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time i ordered a 1gb micro sdcard along with this gps \( for approx 11 on amazon \) and loaded all of north america at one time this eliminates the need to re load maps when traveling anywhere in the country it s worth the extra effort this unit can be quickly moved from one car to another especially a rental car anywhere in north america my very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern manhattan and the bronx it was flawless it s impossible to get lost with this thing occasionally i ve made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re calculate the best route the combination of the voice prompts the highlighted route you need to go and the current and next street \( s \) at the top are excellent also the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice but does not account for traffic jams the arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel it s kind of a best traffic scenario prediction this is so easy to use i m thinking of buying one for my 68 year old mother who doesn t have a clue when it comes to technology but i m convinced she could use this without a problem \( once i ve loaded the maps for her \) if not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a gps system doesn t bother you \( as it doesn t bother me \) buy this you won t be sorry,positive

i did a lot of research not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later i was about to buy the newest 40 720p samsung for 1899 then i stumbled upon this one at circuit city for 1999 and bought it on the spot paid about 50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later i ve had it a week now and i love it standard definition picture quality is just okay but are any of us buying these tvs to watch sdtv i get about 15 hd channels through my cable company including all four major networks plus espn espn2 and a couple music and movie channels therefore a majority of everything i watch is available in hd anyway sdtv content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10 12 feet hd content looks awesome \( including black levels \) and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p i can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available i m going to wait another year or two for the high definition dvd format war to play out before i buy a blu ray or hd dvd player but i ve watched standard definition dvd on my xbox with this tv and the picture is beautiful i m sure high definition dvd would look a little better in a side by side comparison but you will not have any complaints watching standard definition dvd on this tv in short this is an excellent tv especially compared to other 1080p models in its size range if you re looking for something in the range of 2000 2200 this is the one you want enjoy,positive
this product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly a seller will definately buy from again,positive
there are many aspects of the t5 people want to count as negatives for me i consider them annoyances but not killers i would like to have wifi with my pda but i am not dead with out it more memory is always good but the t5 isn t on the hurting side it s not a good mp3 player with the memory it has and even if you have a 2g card with mp3 s it s not like this is what you would buy for mp3s but as far as contact information on the go applications etc i would consider this as good as any other the problem as i have just found out is these are known to die i haven t heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the t5 will at some point die it will lock up and even after all the resets listed from palm it will not come back to even a factory state you will have a palm powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top there are a couple of fixes if you are under warranty you can send it back to palm for them to make it better or you can remove the battery and solder it back this is a serious design issue that palm is more than happy to charge you for until i ran into this i would have rated this a 4 5 until this happened the device did what i expected it to do i read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no wifi but it has one of the fastest processors \( available at that time \) in a pda which was a different type of cool the bluetooth works well enough i haven t had any issues with it you can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn t really that big of a deal but if you can t trust your device is going to be working the next day it really doesn t matter what cool feature it has this has been a very expensive let down i don t want to buy another palm after this experience but i am not sure what to switch to,negative
when outsite temperature is around 0 celsius degrees or below and the car and the unit it s not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange it gives sudden false alarm like k 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 55 5 0 0 0 ku alarm 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm and sometimes when on the highway from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength 5 5 55 5 and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller the spiral coil it s not good to short you need a straight one maybe the scale would be better if it was from 0 to 9,negative

this player is junk it would not play music for more than two hours before going dead when i called toshiba the person that i talked to claimed he wasn t aware battery life was even a problem i directed him to read some of the reviews on c net which i discovered after i bought it \( my fault \) it was finally returned and the battery was replaced now \( after two weeks \) it won t even hold a charge i m returning it and will not recommend this to anyone,negative
after reading several reviews on portable speakers i decided to purchase the sonic impact i f2 for my ipod it has great sound quality the case is durable it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere you can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive this is by far the best accessory i ve purchased for my ipod did i mention that it has a remote control,positive
overall the recorder worked ok a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons however that is irrelevant now a few weeks ago the unit stop working i does not turn on at all what a waist it is out of warranty now,negative
creating a dvd using imovie to idvd even on a powermac g5 quad \( superfast supergreat \) is a 4 5 hour process a 10 15 failure rate due to poor media quality is unacceptable the quality control at memorex sucks it is not so much the cost of the bad dvds but there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5 8 out of every 50 i have used causing a failure to burn after a very lengthy set up process i will be using verbatim blank media from now on,negative
this monitor is an awesome buy i had no problems with my monitor dead pixel wise the only complaints i have to add are those that others have already voiced the stand does not securely fasten to the monitor it just sort of sits there a good push and down she may go the menu buttons on the right side aren t confusing to use my other monitors have used a similar setup menu activates menu and also activates a menu item up down change values menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit if i had put two of these monitors side by side i can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue minor but perhaps irksome i have not tested the speakers but seriously a good set of speakers won t set you back much that s not what this monitor is for i would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat if i didn t already have three monitors to begin with,positive
the cam is good it has a special feature to show the person object by automatic adjustment and a very good part abt it is it has a built in mike and helps a lot,positive
i ve had mine for 10 months now and it s been very reliable not one problem with it it s quick to print out the first page the display is a monochrome lcd with a backlight so you can see in dark spaces \( say if you keep it under a counter \) no paper jams no nonsense also if you re an apple owner the drivers are already included with os x truly plug n print what s a real treat is to combine it with an apple airport express and use apple s bonjour software to easily convert it to a wireless network printer bonjour is available for both os x and windows computers and is a breeze to install i highly recommend if you re in the market for a multifuntion monochrome laser printer machine that is compatible with both windows and mac os,positive
i use to love maxtor still have one from 1999 so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers well the darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone i did have a lot of it backed up but still what a pain now that seagate owns them spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive or get a couple of these and raid them but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping,negative

i use print works cd dvd envelopes and was worried when i ordered this product that the envelopes wouldn t fit top up which is important for me because i label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier the envelopes are just a hair over 5 wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly there is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy i ordered four of these and am glad i did i keep them on a shelf side by seide and the make a perfect card catalog type filing systemfor all my dvds i will most definately be ordering up more of these when i need more room these boxes are great if you use a 5 wide envelope rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds,positive

the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i don t accept having a wireless access point that hangs \( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang \) this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine,negative

i purchased this item recently at a local radio shack because it was on sale for 7 99 in my case i did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered but i did get a disappointing one i use an older cd writer \( nec nr 7800a \) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16x and i have achieved that speed with other media \( notably imation \) in my system however these sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8x no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive on the positive side all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my dvd rom drive dvd player and cd player there s no point in buying this sony product when there are so many others out there find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it update the current model number on sony s web site for the 50 pack cd r spindle is 50cdq80ls3 \( not 50cdq80ls2 \) if you still want to buy sony try to find the current model number,negative
i have two ipods that don t work i bought a shuffle first and that has an error that i can t fix and apple can t fix so i thought i d buy 1gb ipod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer so this time i made the right decision and bought the 30 gb zune wow the zune is so much better it has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely instead of making you frustrated like the ipod the screen is perfect sound quality is excellent 5 stars for the zune,positive

i had looked at numerous stands for my yamaha keyboard and didn t want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand \( at professional prices \) with that in mind the yamaha pkbx2 double x portable keyboard stand is a good choice at 29 99 i had seen other stands that were not as sturdy \( single x stands \) and cost about the same price tips for assembly don t read the instructions just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on amazon and assemble the stand the way it s shown the bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand use the \( included \) allen wrench to remove them pros low price solid sturdy stand works for just about any keyboard the stand s height is fully adjustable and can be done in several seconds without having to unscrew anything cons there is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand no screws bolts or straps are included even though most \( including my yamaha \) keyboards have pre drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand the keyboard simply sits on top of the stand i was very disappointed about this the included allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts the bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool the allen wrench only stripped the bolt it did not loosen it luckily my husband had a better allen wrench of nearly identical size and that one worked without it we would not have been able to loosen the bolt,positive

i researched tvs for a long time before i ended up buying this set it helped that costco offered a coupon for 300 off the price \( 1000 final price \) i thought i may not like the tv so i decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return however there is no way i am returning this tv it s awesome the picture is great and that is just with sd the strech feature makes the regular 4 3 picture fit the screen and not look distored i was worried about buying the 37 tv and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion but there is no need with this tv since sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion dvds look incredible on this tv as well what is even better is the built in hd tuner i was debating upgrading my cable to the hd package but i decide to spend 13 on rabbit ears from target oh my once i plugged in the indoor antenna and let the tv track for digital stations i was amazed the analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter but when i went up to the hd digital companion station i couldn t believe my eyes an incredible hd picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk indoors no less why would i upgrade my cable tv to the hd package when they can t offer the local stations in hd especially when they are free with a simple antenna i was told this was possible but quite frankly i was skeptical not anymore i am so glad i got the sharp that has the built in tuner i seriously considered just buying the hd ready tv monitor and upgrade through my cable provider boy am i glad that i didn t do that if you are in the market for a very nice tv that is easy to use and provides a great picture i would highly recommend this set,positive

no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter the way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i did confirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie,negative

i did a bit of internet research for this and a site devoted to luggage was raving about this what can i say they were right and it is just an unbelievable value i love it i got it because i do alot of walking for my commute had started a class that required me to do alot more to get there and the book was massive my back was already complaining about what i was carrying around on a daily basis i ordered it and it arrived in 2 days my back was and is so grateful it is tough the sidewalks aren t in the best shape and i m always pulling it up and down over curbs and had a couple of days of ice and snow and the wheels are scuffed up but still no worse for wear \( although the little pad on the bottom for cushioning your hip if you wear it over your shoulder fell off but why would i want to carry it like that anyway \) very well designed with plenty of compartments and padded computer sleeve is removeable it maneuvers well is light with a comfortable handle and strap \( gel like \) i can grab it by the handle and walk up the metro stairs with no problem a quality case for a great price,positive

just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they ve lasted me this long for light office use so at 7 year this seems to be a good budget earphones i m not an audiophile so i don t need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story don t twist or touch the wires cable pros lightweight budget oriented comfortable fit for my ears cons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil,positive
overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren t necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set up these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again,positive

i had read several reviews here before purchasing this product but went ahead and bought it anyway thinking that logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted i was wrong after a few weeks of satisfactory use \( long enough to get past amazon s reasonable window for returns \) the space bar started working intermittently incredibly annoying and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes even before the space bar turned against me i was unimpressed with the feel of the keys \( i use a dell wireless keyboard an apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my ibm x series laptop \) bottom line the thing looks great on a desk and it is nicely compact but it probably won t do what you need it to look elsewhere,negative

this is a high quality precision made piece i m very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble not so here everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen all hardware is included along with clear complete instructions i d be surprised if you could find something better,positive

i purchased this because i have to do a lot of math online and was hoping i could use this for that purpose also i was hoping to be able to use it for taking notes so far i m not impressed the pen is a crummy little plastic thing and not very satisfying to use it is actually very uncomfortable particularly when you consider you have to press very hard to get your entire note set to be recorded talk about writer s cramp i m also disappointed that you can t write on it and have it instantly displayed to the computer interactively my fault for not understanding the functionality better but i thought this could double as a writing tablet i can t speak to the size of the paper since i haven t tried any other size in general a big disappointment and 90 dollars that i would have been better off just setting on fire another item destined for craigslist p s to the reviewer who was wanting handwriting recognition my pad did come with a trial version of a package that would convert to text of course that was of very limited use since the stooopid thing failed to capture my handwriting accurately in the first place but the capability is there,negative

at the beginning i really thought this is a very nice product it does solve the cd organize and automatic storage problem for many people however this equipment is poorly engineered i bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons there is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units if you ever think about move this equipment to another room it is almost bound to fail customer service usually take 2 days to respond the phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer imagining someone charges your 400 to organize 300 cds for a year and then quit i am completely pissed off,negative
a couple years ago i got a projector for the big screen effect and decided to finally get my mini advents out of storage for the surround sound my old pioneer receiver worked ok but i decided it was time to upgrade i have 30 year old speaker lab \( build em yourself \) speakers up front with the advents in back the only complaint i have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table \( yes i m old \) so i kept the pioneer for dedicated service to the record player i have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school for him it s a breeze i don t even look at the directions i just say here having said that i think this thing is great if you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system \( wow \) for your records and cassettes ahh technology i love this thing i can understand that some folks want something better but for 95 of us this will be the last one you will ever need highly recommended 4 stars for the lack of lp connection otherwise 5 all the way,positive
first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones always pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel,negative
cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 s to early 90 s the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for,negative

i got this case for my ws 320m which i ve been wearing around my neck like a mp3 player the material of the case seems to be genuine leather \( or really good vinyl \) and brushed felt it looks good professional looking i ve enclosed what i hope are representative pictures of this case all the buttons of the recorder are accessible even when the flap is closed the microphone headphone jacks are available as are the rec stop play buttons if the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built in microphone you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well there is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the hold button on the side of the recorder not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the hold button however since the hold button is meant to slide down \( away from the microphone \) for it to be released if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case the resulting friction would actually unlock the hold button the belt loop is an adjustable velcro i would have preferred a sewn on belt loop \( so the case cannot come off the belt accidently \) or a nice stiff clip \( for easy access \) or even a riveted snap button but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times the case is closed shut with another velcro strap all in all it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport or being able to put it on your belt after everything else \( line in mic headphone recording playing \) is set up the relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case \( mainly due to very small buttons \) as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case the case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder my bias lies in that i like to use it as an mp3 player and i wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap loop from a flash drive placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such i think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt on one positive note i believe this is the first time that i was the first reviewer for anything from amazon woo hoo,negative
i bought the c crane fm transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an fm tuner with headsets as i worked around the house and yard it broadcast 5 or 6 feet max out of the box i performed the power boosting fix and now it broadcasts 10 20 feet if i m lucky before static overpowers the signal this was a disappointing purchase directly from c crane that in no way met my expectations if it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities build it that way from the get go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly i kept the transmitter because i wanted one for the car it s physically well built and works fine for that i also use it to play my ipod through a radio but understand the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter if you want to transmit throughout your house and yard look elsewhere,negative
i have 8860dn it based on the same engine as this one the only difference wireless so here is my experience hope it will be helpfull i was with hp for 15 20 years needed mfp read all reviews here and decided that mfc 8860dn will be a good choice \( other option was hp 3055 \) it has everything i need copier network print scan fax easy setup \( i am in it for 25 years \) everything was almost perfect the only complaint you need to keep in mind it eats 1100 watts when starts printing light could flash it was ok until i reached 1500 pages mark it start printing small dots every 3 no problem need to clean everything \( per my experience and confirmed on brother s web site \) cleaned it was the biggest mistake all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page called support 2 times after few hours of troubleshooting they advised me to replace drum hey its only 1500 pages nowhere close to promised 25000 after i mentioned it they offered me 75 discount on it what s about warranty sorry i spoke to supervisor he explained that support in philippines can t do it the only option to call usa office i replaced drum now counter shows around 2000 pages and i have same problem again hey i heard this before never say never still as of today i would never never buy brother printer mfc again,negative
i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room the sound is so so and it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing it is also very big taking up 1 2 my nightstand the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live this morning i finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash i won t miss it at all,negative

i wish i had read the amazon reviews of this item before i paid 19 for it at an office supply store it may seem a bit trivial but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker it s unfortunate too because everything else about it is perfect the color the comfortable gel support and soft fabric and the size \( it runs the length of my mac keyboard and provides support when i use my mouse \) but the smell a piercing toxic smell that does not go away it doesn t matter if i spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer i still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad and it s made it impossible for me to work i finally had to get rid of it,negative
i agree with the comments posted here like most of us i was interested in the bose sound yet put off by the prestige price even on e bay the going price ended up being around 400 for a used older model so i did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison shopper article that put the bose up against several competitors including this high end teac i have to say that i m entirely satisfied the chrome retro look is quite appealing and the model has a couple of features that for me beat out bose entirely i wanted a top loading door like the old bose models but also the ability to play mp3 like the new ones and this gave me both the sound and punch is remarkable at flat setting it is a bit bassy that s true but you get a 5 to 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment i set mine at 3 and 1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic 10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough and just remember to set it to a station \( or load a cd \) that you d want to be woken up to before calling it a night teac customer service i can t comment on but i bought a reconditioned unit from an amazon seller for less than 100 including shipping a sweet deal for a sweet machine,positive

this card using via s superb envy24 ht chipset is a huge improvement over my realtek and via envy24ht s based cards everything sounds better my old audigy 2 platinum \( which i think i shall melt \) did better in 3d games but only slightly since this card doesn t snap crackle and pop like the creative cards do i ll venture to say that it actually does make games better since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game pros very high audio sampling rates allowing for incredibly good audio production warm rich warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs no crackling popping or hissing a real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why creative labs cards keep doing this well maintained solid drivers supports eax 2 0 excellent asio support cons no hardware support for directsound however if your machine is faster than about 1ghz you probably won t notice the difference benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you ll find that no hardware directsound acceleration amounts to less than a 1 difference in speed only supports up to eax 2 0 due to creative labs refusing to license the technology sound difference is minimal though,positive
so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront 2 on pc and it works like a dream i also like the x box controller layout \( offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic \) than the ps2 style controller that is the logitech rumble pad it also has better grips than a ps2 controller the only things i think are bad about it are the following 1 it is not modeled on the large xbox controller but rather the regular one which is ok for most people but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long 2 i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game this isn t an issue with battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator but i could see where if a game didn t have as good an interface \( or maybe older games \) this pad could suffer in this regard 3 this isn t so much an issue for me but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out i don t care too much because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything i will still use it even if it does die overall a great controller i actually would give it a 4 5 rating but that isn t an option here,positive
in my opinion sony s strength lies in its tvs this line of lcd sets are expensive but you ll definitely get what you pay for the picture quality is incredible the beauty of this set is also material it is a work of art while the internal speakers are decent i would have been just as happy not to have them but thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel you don t even know the speakers are there some reviewers have mentioned lcd clouding and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate google search but sony stands by its products and if you receive a set that is not up to standards they will rectify the situation also many reviewers are mentioning a lower quality picture it is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the tv and what signal will give you the optimal image not all hd signals are the same and will provide you with varying degrees of quality be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device but i have yet to see a signal that wasn t enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous panasonic tube set the interchangable bezels is a nice idea but only for those with deep \( er \) pockets the silver set alone is beautiful and if i had only one complaint it would be that it s harder to get matching sony peripherals in silver than you might think all in all it s the best lcd you can buy,positive

i liked this charger so much that i ended up ordering a second unit premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty i called lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what they sent me another charger without hussle the call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way they definetly stand by and back up their warranty no problems with the second unit and if i ever need another one i would still buy a lenmar the two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar ppro h batteries one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular nimh batteries it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80 level in less than 15 minutes and the other ppro h batteries in about 7 8 minutes i didn t notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the ppro h batteries but the ppro h kind are more durable this charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110 240 v and the first to use neotherm charging technology it s solid and heavy duty charger not like the cheap kind that are everywhere i went through lots of sony chargers but you know what they will never see my money again the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot i have been using the msc815 since october 2005 almost daily and never once i had an issue with it,positive
this is a great case i have had no problems with it and works very well it s also very sexy if you want to put it that way and looks really cool only trouble i have is that when i open it sometimes it ll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch but its very minor and does no damage it s a great item however if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot i d recommend one of those soft outer cases too because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc just protect it from scratches and smudges i recommend it highly,positive

i purchased the md781 md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681 i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets \( everyone online offline was constantly out of stock \) overall i m disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone handheld phones i like them more than any other phone i ve tried unlike most phones these days they re big and have a very solid feel to them it s just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation the buttons are a nice size and easy to use the hands free speak phone on the handheld works well with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it s hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better it s a few clicks and slow to access almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand or copy the number to the local units phonebook which defeats the purpose as for the answer machine once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages if any are in the system \( is it just me or is that poor design \) so if you listen to messages when you partner isn t around you need to leave a note for them to check messages the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy i also like how the handset docked in the older m681 it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk,negative

i was pretty excited about this player having read about it in runners world there are a lot of problems with it however while it is advertised as a sports mp3 player in a lot of respects it isn t very convenient for someone who buys it for sports my issues are headphones are not at all appropriate for sports particularly running they keep falling off so i had to invest in a better pair of headphones kind of weird since it s supposed to be a sports player also i spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them hard to change music while running and it often ends up doing something i don t want it to you can t change the music without removing the mp3 player from the armband which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can t tell from any picture not easy to figure out the features of the player such as the stopwatch pedometer also hard to use once you do figure it out software is a pain to use organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player that being said i still use it there are some good features long battery life recharges super quick very cool looking player very easy to carry around can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size i would not recommend this player and if given a choice i would not buy it again,negative

this review pertains specifically to the targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2 0 hub the cord is about 2 5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy duty hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible inconvenient to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk,positive
i just added this to my onkyo htib system and it s made all the difference in the world i m a bit of an audiophile \( on a reasonable budget \) with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10 polk in my truck i m most satisfied with the polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess i listen to a lot of music with double bass drumming and thought that this psw12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10 sub i like so much not the case what i get is very quick bass with that ground shaking impact that i always look for i m still going easy on er for the break in period but i can say that the trailer for kingdom of heaven \( included on the blu ray disc \) sounds absolutely stunning paired with my 57 sony hdtv trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days now is a great time to pick up one of these since the price seems to have recently dropped by about 50 throughout the web unbeatable sub for the money,positive

first of all i am a dyed in the wool techie i design products like this in my job i know what every single one of those what the heck is that settings in router set up screens are so i do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many \( most \) who have had trouble with this router morons yes i got it to work it will work right out of the box if used with most pre n wireless cards and definitely if they are linksys pre n cards that covers about 1 of those who would buy this router after three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default i succeeded in getting it to hand shake with b and g mode cards most of the time it would still randomly lose the ip requiring rebooting everything not something my customer would accept nor would i sell some of the techie specs are a long way from what linksys claims linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both they failed a non techie spec important to everyone is range it has 20 the range of an old b mode linksys router i had sitting right next to it adding encryption dropped range in half again the wired router portion of it works out of the box no adjustments required but you re buying this for the wireless function yes i could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with but linksys didn t used to be that way i used to buy only linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware this is the third linksys router in a month \( the other two were g mode \) that have been unstable or doa then why did i buy this one it was on sale and i wanted to give linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good they ve now lost it for good i exchanged the router for a netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards plus it was a lot less money has cisco ruined linksys got me did all the good engineers cash out i wouldn t be surprised are they rushing unfinished bug filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for wall street you bet i ll stick with netgear and belkin from now on,negative

these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed i bought them in may and they broke after 2 3 and 4 months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty \( this is 1 year \) and higher quality components,negative
this is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours \( but did make it beyond the very short warrenty \) it was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long for the price i expected a durable and well built machine i was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it,negative

i love the sling media slingbox tuner the install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews the quality of picture is just as good as on my cable tv i have a great processor with the highest internet speed i could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color i get with it and may also be the reason i have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time plue my shipment from amazon was in 2 days you rock amazon,positive

wow i m surprised by the reviews made here about this product despite the bad reviews i bought it anyway i still believe in a motorola guess what not bad i bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my siemens the siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago this moto phone has the features most people will ever need the shared phonebook is very valuable a loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent i don t understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality ok the range is not as good as my 2 4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home after about 75 meters with 3 walls in between i can start to hear the voice i m speaking to crackles i just did this for test but i can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house i am running a 2ghz wi fi and do not hear any interference with regard to the phonebook i wish i can enter more characters each address the maximum characters i can enter is only 11 i think i can enter about 20 on my siemens another minor quirk is when someone called i could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party not with this phone i still have to press the flash bottom everytime before i can start talking build quality is excellent it is a little on the heavy side which i like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic even if i squeeze the handset hard i didn t hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping i tried the pana v tech uniden ge and att in a local store and the motorola is tops you will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here i personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around if you do not see it that way it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product,positive

i bought this phone based on a review in wired magazine i love their reviews usually but this one really let me down i read another customer s review \( i forget where \) saying they had sound quality problems but i thought yeah right one in a million well i bought the phone and had the exact same experience very poor sound voice quality it sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel i cannot imagine why i charged the battery for 48 hrs i had it on a separate circuit and it had it s own line i plugged in an old ge 2 4 ghz phone an whamo no troubles what so ever needless to say i took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord sometimes you don t get what you pay for,negative
this photo paper is truly top of the line profession grade paper i have been using it for a few years in making very large photo prints and they always turn out great,positive
i really don t have much to say about this book holder not that it s just a book holder it s a nice one it does it s job it s a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic it s strong sturdy and it s big enough even for those massive heavy textbooks like the calculus ones although i would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that s like 6 thick \( even though it still may hold \) it s got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place although those tend to fall off when you move them but that s no big deal just put them back on this book holder is kind of big and i would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom but it s not too big you should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time,positive

if you re considering the viamichelin \( under 200 gps \) you re probably trying to decide if a gps that is more than 100 cheaper \( much more than 100 in some cases \) than its competitors is really any good honestly i would have been skeptical too however a relative bought one of these units and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before i decided to purchase one myself my brief summary is that yes this unit is a good gps and a great value after using mine on a trip i d have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine background my gps experience is limited to a 7 year old garmin iii plus i had to plan detailed trips on my pc using mapsource then upload the waypoints and routes to the gps it could be a time consuming process and because the unit wasn t necessarily user friendly my wife never learned how to use it enter the viamichelin we just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit set up time for the trip was about a minute all i had to do was program in the street address of our destination now for the rundown first what it doesn t do well a \) using it for the past two weeks \( as a test only \) around my home town i was a little disappointed it never sent me the wrong way but it didn t always take the best route some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area and in some cases old logging roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route although this was disconcerting at first i don t think it is a big deal as you ll see later b \) macro directions i e for a several hundred mile trip it will get you there and if you re taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns this would be a good device if you aren t familiar with the route but my route this weekend was very simple get to the interstate and drive it didn t pick my preferred route to the interstate and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate \( although it did recover and finally suggest my route as i stubbornly drove my way \) so for a major trip i d recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route use this device if you have a lot of mind numbing turn by turn now what it does well a \) voice prompts are great it doesn t matter that it doesn t say the street names turn right in 300 feet is good enough especially with the map that you can glance at b \) it did great around my destination towns of charlotte nc gastonia nc and rock hill sc did it take the best route as i drove from soccer fields to hotels to restaurants i don t know since i wasn t familiar with the areas but the routes seems to be just fine they got me exactly where i needed to go and i never had to look at a road map and after all this was the main reason i needed a newer gps it passed this with flying colors c \) my wife did some of the set up while in the car she ll be using this one on her on very soon d \) we wanted to find a particular restaurant but didn t have the street address the restaurant was in the points of interest database and it took us right to it also finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great i also found a feature that was not listed in the 89 page manual from the navigation map if you touch the screen it has a bypass route option it will give you some distant options \( 1 mi 5 mi etc \) then it will find a bypass route for you so if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam this will route you off the interstate take you up the road and bring you back on obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving but then it s going to try to turn you around and or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer the bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out in the future i would like to do a side by side comparison w a more expensive \( borrowed \) gps also after more experience i d like to update this review bottom line i am glad i bought this unit i cannot imagine spending 100 500 more on a more expensive model though the higher priced models may have better features the value for the extra money just isn t there for me,positive

while the two fans i ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly they are not as advertised on amazon s website according to the specs on the site they have a double ball bearing design which last longer than normal fans be warned these are not the antec double ball bearing fans but the less expensive ones have contacted amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately,positive
i used this recorder alot i have alot of classes and the playback is good it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you haven t listened yet you can move to the next folder and record the sound quality is good 36h record time which can be broken up to folders the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low and that goes vice versa as well nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons,positive

the only reason i didn t give this item 5 stars is because i have only taken it on the road once so as of yet i can t call it a worthy road warrior however it is certainly a great case proportioned well and good design with space for essentials would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17 widescreen notebook,positive
cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 s to early 90 s the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for,negative
camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as dlink recommends i bought from ebay new and dlink refused to replace or repair so beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired think twice about buying dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty from unauthorized seller or buying used,negative
this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i wouldn t take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate,negative

i bought this phone for the great features and because i ve had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i can t talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them,negative
code length of this product is very small i had to buy an extention cord the sound quality is not bad,positive

i have to admit the main reason i purchased \( 2 \) of these dvc 1100 s was because of the stellar reviews posted here on amazon i bought one for my in laws and on for my wife and i so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance great idea bad solution the main problem i had was that the camera lens is fixed and does not focus i waited 1 hour on the line with d link tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 8 feet away from the camera unfortunately the ones i got did not focus at all and the video quality was absolutely terrible \( washed out color and bad contrast \) please listen to me save your money and do not buy the dvc 1100 this device is cheaply made and just not there yet,negative

i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head isn t working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they don t even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is don t buy this model,negative
i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs i bought this lens cleaner and voila the recorder is working again super easy to use \( it s simply a dvd that you insert into your machine and the menus tell you what to do \) highly recommended,positive
this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device doesn t fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i m very disappointed and i m returning it,negative
this wall mount works and hold s great i used it for an olevia 542i lcd flat panel and have had no problems the instructions are not all that clear but it is not hard to figure out how to instal,positive
when i got this product out of the box \( i hadn t seen one in a store before \) i was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared particularly at the price they charged \( about 80 at the time \) the box i received was also missing the insert for the ipod nano and the nano won t sit securely in the ipod socket without it i returned this product and for about the same price i got a much more solid and better sounding boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano \( though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your ipod songs \) this wouldn t be a bad ipod speaker set if you could get it for 20 but at 80 it s dramatically overpriced,negative
just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from western digitals website you should have no problems very nice,positive
look for a bargain basement product what do you expect first you expect it to work and i can confirm it definitely does work when plugged in to usb it signals xp correctly the driver software is very tolerant you can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device so installation is a 5 minute process next comes the capture and initial encoding well the software is a bit lame as far as features and gui typical but it absolutely saves in mpeg2 dvd format just as you d need it to for making dvds of all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content the frame rate is full on 30 fps it takes an svideo or standard rca video signal both are just fine in quality the resolutions are not that great but its passable for dvd when you crank it up don t think you can encode some blu ray quality mpeg with this though as far as the overall durability of the product i ve literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight it gets hot but its never so much as flickered or needed reset bottom line this thing is like a kids toy its cheesy but tough as nails get it for your first analog signal mpeg encoder its a good value,positive
the product works well for my space and needs one note to amaazon when you ship a 400 item thats semi fragile and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball how does the consumer deal with physical damage the item is so massive to ship back and most likey costly i experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right i was worried how the shipping would be handled and sure enough i was worried rightfully the dvd tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out the top of the receiver dvd player had been slightly caved in even with all the packing samsung supplied it could not protect the product from the shipping company it will be such a hassle to try and exchange this that i am not sure if i will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again other than that i have purchased smaller items and less fragile from amazon with no issues i realize that the shipping damage canot be held on amazon as it is out of their control i just don t think i will roll the dice on something like this in the future too bad it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen,positive
i ve owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems i don t know anything about an upgrade but so far i haven t had any major problems with it when i left it in the car and then came home it wouldn t turn on i noticed it was very warm but as soon as i did a soft reset the device turned on the soft reset doesn t make you lose all your data i just had to reset the date i ve had to do this a couple of times so far i did purchase a 2 gig sd card and have lots of room i recommend that you shop around for the 2 gig memory card however because i bought mine from amazon and then i found it cheaper at best buy i am really happy with this product i love the way it looks it s easy to figure out and i m not really savvy with electronic gadgets i did sign up for hotmail so i could use the msn features it was easy to sync my music to the device and the download is done automatically with the sync the music sounds great with a great pair of headphones i use the calendar which helps to remind of events and appointments also use the task button which reminds of stuff that needs to be done great for the highly stressed out who tend to forget things there is also a feature to write a note in your own handwriting and then the device turns it into typewritten words really neat i use the recording device to record my class lecture and it s a little hard to hear but there is a lot of noise in the classroom and i sit in the back and the teacher is up at the front but the important thing is that i could understand what was being said so i could transcribe it as a nursing student i was able to purchase and download nursing programs from a website with no problems and they run great i just can t believe all the features that come with this pocket pc i have no regrets making this purchase i look forward to reading more reviews on this product and learning everything it can do so far it s been fun,positive

i am using this bag for school in which i need to carry 4 textbooks a laptop \( 15 4 inch screen \) and a couple of notebooks the pack has plenty of room for these items and still a couple of empty front pockets for additional gear with all that weight the pack is still comfortable to wear and has yet to bother my back,positive
i bought these for my dvd player they work wonderfully the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but didn t measure up these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies especially the dialogue the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds,positive

this is just a general review of all dvd cases i have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs i was stationed in germany for over 2 years and anyone who had been there knows that afn sucks so dvd s is your only source of video entertainment my collection grew to more than 400 i have been trying to find a good case that hold equal number of title books as it does dvd s but that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to be made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard p o s s and nothing i would want to keep in my garage i hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied,negative
i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod \( one fewer thing to carry \) well about six months after opening this item i noticed that my ipod was running on battery one of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore i am disappointed but should have expected that for the 10 i spent,negative

after reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my ipod i had read a lot about how it interefered with the usb cable or the hold switch but i couldn t argue with the price i must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket ipod products i have puchased it does exactly what it is supposed to do protect my ipod i have no trouble opperating any of the ipod s buttons and i simply remove the case when i charge the unit i have not found that it impairs the functionality of the ipod at all while keeping it securely around my neck it is perfect for jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites i find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion ultimately it perfectly protects my ipod when i am out and about which is what it was designed to do the reasons i gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little and i whished they had mounted the ipod right side up like they did on the nano model over all i am well please,positive

i had a 1st generation shuffle and upgraded to a 60gb video which i adore however i found that whenever i went running i was stealing my old shuffle back from my daughter i bought this shuffle for my husband and fell in instant love with it i really like how portable it is and you can t beat being able to just clip it onto your clothing no arm straps no more lanyards so now i have the 60 gig for my entire library of music and videos and the shuffle for exercise,positive
it works the antenna isnt junk either i am getting almost all the digital stations from chicago 25 miles from sears tower with it inside my house sitting on my desk i also get many digital channels that happen to be on the comcast analog cable in my area \( chicagoland \) problem is that all the analog stations on my comcast cable are untuneable so i cant watch those on my mac its not supposed to be a cable tuning box just digital stuff so its fine i just thought it did that as well next thing to do is get a bigger better antenna mounted outside and cancel cable \( as i only watch a couple stations anyways \) eyetv works cytv with it works great make sure you go and donate to that opensource project,positive
amazon was great about shipping this product but i eventually returned it due to several problems they were also great about the return they paid the return shipping and i got a full refund i never tried any recordings with this card using the media center software that is part of windows mce i was using it with snapstream beyondtv 4 1 if you record using anything but the best \( dvd 720x480 \) quality level it would crop out part of the picture this is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue the latest hauppauge driver did not solve the problem the other problem i had is that several times when i was recording two programs at the same time one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it i don t know if this was a problem with the card or beyondtv but i think it s probably due to the card i don t know if i had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards i also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured i have hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other pcs and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card after reading some reviews it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also \( and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card \) beyondtv works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above but i also only have one tuner card in the pcs that i use these cards in so i can t comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using beyondtv i returned the 500 card and i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards thus far i m not having any of the issues with them in beyondtv that i was having with the hauppauge 500 card i can record at a lower quality level with no cropping and i ve had no audio issues so far the quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card \( although maybe not as good as that captured by the hauppauge 250 and 350 cards \),negative

this product is a sad joke it s expensive of course the paper is just heavyweight paper that s perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves which takes some effort \( not sure if it d be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board \) but whatever however the software is crap that s the appropriate term reading this i can save you an hour of your precious time no you can t make the template show right side up that s right to use the software you have to tilt your head sideways i m not kidding i guess you could also turn your monitor on it s side you can rotate the text so it shows the way it should but when you edit it it ll be sideways again so you ll have to turn your head \( or monitor \) back and forth sideways what kind of company would sell such a product and oh yeah if you re looking for templates for the dvd inserts nada they re not there,negative

i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february today march 6th i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all 4 500 of them are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd s the player just wouldn t read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer service tech department of any computer electronic company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a 3rd or 4th language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can t believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2 3 days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don t plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1 2gb file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up 7 1gb after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i don t like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because 1 it plays all my music 2 they have a customer service tech support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff,negative

i bought this model in order to be rid of my almost new sony mhcec70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner having once owned an earlier pm series model this new panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint like its predecessor the pm53 is a nice powerful compact stereo with \( for the money \) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner especially on the fm band it can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses the remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual right now this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning sony s competing models are cheesy looking \( hog attention on store shelves \) bigger \( i e take more materials cost more to ship \) and consequently suffer certain cost cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified \( and of course proprietary \) antenna connector it s like choosing between the pontiac and the toyota the sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar coated bling the panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture,positive

i m sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if i had used it i have found samsung products to be very good i did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my xm satellite radio subscription i already am paying costs for two radios i purchased this item to have more portable capabilities but i did not want to incur an additional charge on my xm account consequently i returned the product without using it,negative

specs look good hdmi 1 3a 1080p firmware upgrade over ethernet etc the unit seems to be solid \( heavy \) and well built however toshiba chose to ship this hd dvd player with only a composite a v cable \( yellow red white rca jacks \) in the box the best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i and not even as good as an s video connection for that it is pretty amazing that a high end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high definition capabilities and hdmi 1 3a interface is being shipped without a cable set \( component video or hdmi \) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an hdtv i don t know how much cost savings toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than 5 now let s get to the real review pros one of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular dvds to 1080p the upscaling is very high quality the unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered dvds if the weight of the unit is any indication build quality is high it has an ethernet port for firmware updates \( and possible future functionality \) cons very slow boot time takes longer to boot than my windows xp pc especially durimg 1080p hd dvd playback the unit gets very hot make sure your enclosure rack is open in the back there is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player this player has no zoom scaling functions for dealing with non anomorphic dvds so you have to use your tvs scaling function kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers,negative

firstoff that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong let me explain how this works the soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like itunes it has its own proprietary format that is really just mp3 with a different file extension title when you import your mp3s into the soundstage library it makes its own duplicate library of your music in a new directory using its omg file suffix yes omg i think that s funny and you should too the minidiscs themselves are essentially just cd rws keep this in mind they are enjoyable cheap to buy more they are rewritable and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd audio or close to 4 5 hours of low bitrate audio which is just compressed mp3s the product itself is very good i ve had one for a short while i bought an eight pack of disks right after i got it and filled them with music i have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc swapping of five hour playlists is far less irritating than my old cd player method cd swapping with 70 minute albums the controls are very simple and effective grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio cd its impeccably shockproof and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight the hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light i got this as an alternative to harddrive mp3 jukeboxes most mp3 players over a gig in capacity are hd storage which is far less durable \( in my experience \) than simpler players rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that i would have to swap on my computer constantly i got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me its a solution that suited me well,positive

the first ipod clock radio i bought was an emerson itone that was very disappointing after returning it i did a bunch of research and decided to order the i177 \( white \) i am very happy with the unit the sound is great while it is not a bose it sounds way better than your average alarm clock the controls are very intuitive and simple to use i have a 4th generation ipod and it fit perfectly another great feature is the display dimmer you can turn the backlight completely off a feature not found in many other products a common complaint i read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room not a problem with this unit the remote control is pretty neat too i like the fact that i can control my ipod remotely there are 2 separate alarms which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time the only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations this would be nice but i bought this unit to wake to my ipod so i can t complain overall this thing is great,positive

i enjoyed putting this together the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves weren t spaced properly cd sized so i had to take it apart and redo it but that wasn t too bad the spacers snap apart easily enough even for my feeble fingers it s not terribly sturdy maybe i didn t get the poles screwed down tightly enough but as long as it s in its permanent location holds the multimedia well i really like the way it looks bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one too,positive

consider another receiver before buying delorme s delorme s receiver works only with their software \( the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers \) the delorme software itself is not very accurate just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme s software sometimes is unable to find it \( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesn t seem to accomplish much \) real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages,negative
i ve purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters one of them was on an older dell laptop installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a linksys wrt54g router with wap encryption the problems really started showing when i tried to install the second and third adapters both on desktop computers running windows xp sp2 the software installation was a breeze but when i plugged in the adapter nothing happened connect to network which network scan who what it looks like this adapter has a very very short range and doesn t work very well a wall or two in between the routers it would see the router and connect to drop the connection and not find one but then it would find it again and on and off never really worked as expected on the desktops so i ve given up i ve had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times downloaded the updated software from belkin s site and still have connection issues with the desktops the laptop works fine as long as i don t take it one room away from the router avoid at all costs please i ve used other wireless devices with the same router that i m trying to connect and they work fine a few rooms away and all spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing good luck,negative
i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter i obviously purchased a lemon have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period how s that for sound logic i really like it when it works but unfortunately an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button,negative

i only have a couple of problems with this remote you have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd vcr audio sat etc to change the setting that sounds like i m complaining a lot and i am \( sue me ha ha \) the other is this i bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working i can t teach it the functions that i need through the learn command since the orginal remote quit which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote i have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote wouldn t allow me to set the vcr clock and local channels after a power outage other than that i have no problem with it,positive
i love this arm band i have had it for about 6 months now you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer i also only use my ipod for the gym so its nice that this arm band provides great protection \( better than ipod s armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on \) as well as not coming off while working out,positive
i bought this mount for a philips 42 plasma tv the tv weighs probably about 100lbs i thought the price for it was ok but i don t know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts the mount was put on our living room wall by a handy man because i didn t have a stud finder he was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic the mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured the 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the tv sits a little high but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house the room for the input cables is a little small and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven t noticed any degradation in the signal none of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way so its not of a concern i took the cables and made a 1 trunk of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories the tv sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt i rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong it also looks nice and stays well hidden its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the tv easy \( i had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables \) i am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product,positive

we bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters it resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard drive crash that everyone fears but nobody thinks will happen to them attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they re left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find expecting our first child in less than three weeks we don t want to find ourselves in the same predicament especially with years of other irreplaceable photos financial data and other documents on our laptop now we re doing weekly monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive even if we don t completely stick with this new regimen it s better than what we used to do which though thankfully uneventful was absolutely nothing if that s not enough to make you want to buy this then the sony name quality reliability and ease of use should be the drive is small stylish easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position although it s a little loud when the drive is working it reads and writes cd r media up to 48x ultra speed plus cd rw up to 32x dvd r up to 16x and high speed dvd rw up to 8x after a lengthy initial full backup using the included nero backitup software \( about 8 gb onto 10 old cd r discs in 2 5 3 0 hours \) smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x dvd rw discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing copying and verifying everything backup copies of our 4 gb wedding dvd onto 8x dvd r discs took about 15 20 minutes the nero software seems very extensive but i haven t used much of it so far the interface is pretty intuitive and it s easy to find what you want to do but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who s new to this kind of software or doesn t want to spend a lot of time reading the pdf manual the only real complaint i have is with the backitup program s job scheduler which only gives you daily weekly and yearly frequency options \( you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months \) it takes forever to re scan files when building a new job on an existing one \( setting up subsequent daily weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup \) and the data you can change for an existing job is limited \( can t rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job \) overall great external dvd cd drive for watching video listening to music and backing up data good software that s intuitive and functional with some room for improvement but there s no real need for additional software you don t already have excellent value bought it at amazon for under 160 with taxes and free shipping and got a 30 mail in rebate from sony also bought pack of 25 ritek 8x dvd rw discs from thetechgeek com for 33 delivered and they threw in a free 10 pack of velocity 8x dvd r discs so for well under 200 and a little effort you too can view hear copy and or backup your valuable photos videos tunes and other data in no time,positive
still embarking on spooling off all the hi 8 tapes i have but i ve been very satisfied with the plextor unit so far first thing i did was to spool one hi 8 tape and then make a dvd using the functionality of the bundled windvd creator software good news it worked and a few hours after i started i was watching the dvd i created on my bedroom dvd player bad news the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances it may be that i m still climbing the learning curve with it but i think it s just not very good i m looking into other solutions such as pinnacle adobe premiere elements etc meanwhile i keep spooling i haven t yet tried the tv capture in any depth it looked like it worked but again with some annoyances on the software side plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software,positive

mouse is comfortable to use and i haven t had any problems with it so far i did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer but once i figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there it is my first wireless mouse so i have nothing else to compare it to but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse,positive
i have been putting this television through its paces since i got it a few weeks ago and it is by far the best tv i have ever owned and very difficult to beat the image quality is really good with bright vivid colors and wonderful detail especially for 1080i p content but even lower resolution 720p content which is what s more commonly available on ota hd broadcast looks phenomenal i also have an apple tv hooked up to it and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p 480p or 720p it still looks quite good it does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost and the dnie processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse however it s very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have like all lcds it does have some slight black point problems these aren t noticeable for fullscreen 16 9 content but for older 4 3 content it s pretty obvious that the black isn t pure black however this is again tunable the only thing i really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn t do a very good job of upscaling 480i content such as the output from most video game systems and for dvds to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up it s really more a sad reflection on how the previous next generation video looks downright primitive by today s standards the other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners it doesn t have an on screen program guide my previous tv \( also a samsung \) had an on screen program guide but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the epg information anyway so it s not really that big of a deal you can still see the detailed information for the program that s currently showing so it makes use of epg just not as much as it could this television s tuner is also quite phenomenal my previous tv required a very carefully positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation while with this one i only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and i get perfect reception of every local digital station another nice improvement over samsung s older hdtvs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that tv stations do \( for example pillboxing a letterboxed 16 9 show which is very common for widescreen non hd programming \) also analog tv stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo \( while previous samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material \) as a pc monitor this is also quite nice i have a mac mini hooked up via svga cable and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal clear and of course you can hook it up via hdmi \( with a dvi to hdmi adaptor \) as well the only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint at least on analog svga the only 16 9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080 which can be difficult for some older systems to handle however on hdmi it should support all the standard hd resolutions this television may be more expensive than others in its size class but it also far outshines every other tv i have seen aside from the newer ln t4065 which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio if you want to only buy one tv which will last for a long time it would be hard to go wrong with this one,positive

i ve had this phone less than a week but i have been pleased with it s performance so far the set up was somewhat tricky as many if not all skype addresses use a period in the address none of the literature showed how to find the period by accident i noticed it was available on the 1 button after discovering that the installation went flawlessly if one is already familiar with the use of the alpha numeric keypad one would have no problems if one is learning on this phone with the literature provided one needs help the phone has worked well with both the landline and the skypeout alternatives i m pleased enough that i m buying two more as the equipment will accomodate up to four phones,positive

when we initially pulled this out the box i was excited becaue it was crafted so well real wood and excellent craftsmanship however the sound absolutely sucks it sounds like elmo s toy piano or even worse i thought it was just the fact that the piano was sitting flat on the floor \( i hadn t installed the legs yet \) and the sound was just off by the time i got everything assembled the disappointment settled in even deeper this piano was not worth the price i paid for it by any stretch of the imagination i realize this is a toy and not an instrument but again for the money you d expect a better sounding product an added note my daughter loves banging on it,positive
i bought this hd because my lacie \( which had lasted over 5 years \) crashed on me finally so i figured i would try a different company out of the box this product looked great although it was very large and heavy i immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up however that was the one and only time that it booted i tried several more times and it wouldn t boot up very very scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it won t boot up out of the box i don t know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked but i am not taking any chance on a defective hd and my data going back to lacie,negative

i exchange audio letters with friends and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available the sound quality is perfectly fine though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high end machine it comes with a stereo microphone but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit as it is there is a long clip on cord this makes it tough to do off the cuff recording overall a good value for the money the other machine cost nearly 300,positive

i bought two lexar thumbdrives over other brands partially based on their rebate offers despite my methodical record keeping and submission i simply got post cards saying that i did not meet the rebate requirements \( in place of the rebate checks \) the first time it happened i thought it was oh well my fault but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission this is simply frank fraud by lexar on a smaller scale therefore not worth customers time to file a complaint or to pursue it further i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again,negative

these are 10 headphones there s nothing amazing about them in my opinion i bought them to use with my ipod when i m out or at work right out of the box i was disappointed with the fit and i know everyone is going to be different but for me they just aren t comfortable the sound quality is clear but very thin and lacking bass even when i m pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit the bass just isn t good eq settings to boost the bass don t help either and often reduce sound quality even more the ear clips don t really seem to do that much either they kind of keep them on your ears but don t really hold them in your ears at all the ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well in summary i wouldn t recommend these for music but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word they might be good if you can tolerate them in your ears for that long,negative
when i buy flash memory i consider price speed manufacturer and vendor i got this particular memory stick for a sonyericsson w810i phone i paid extra to get it from amazon \( no they don t always have the best price \) this way i am confident that i can return it if i got the wrong one or have a problem with it the card works fine in my phone and since i have a usb cable that hooks up to the phone i don t have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader i have not yet experienced any problems with sandisk memory products i am told that the sandisk sticks are faster than sony s but i have no way to confirm this nor do i know if my phone \( mp3 player camera \) is able to take advantage of faster speeds the longest process is transferring music to the phone and i wasn t in a hurry anyway this stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format so i can use the 128mb stick that i replaced in my sony camcorder \( which had a 4mb stick in it no it s not a typo it s actually a 4 megabyte memory stick \),positive

my wife and i have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via wifi spread throughout our four bedroom home among these were an avaya 4610sw sip \( voip \) phone and a pc serving as an asterisk server \( asterisk is an open source pbx \) this configuration has worked well for a couple of years now in the past few months i ve been having occasional disconnects of voip calls coming in to asterisk from the pstn after some investigation i decided to move my phone and server off wifi and onto a homeplug network using the electrical wiring as another ethernet the hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second floor office where my phone is in the basement where the server is and in the family room on the first floor where the linksys wifi router access point is located after that it was just a matter of plugging in an ethernet cable from the netgear box to the router and moving the ethernet cables from the wifi boxes for the phone and server to the netgear boxes it was that simple i wish all high tech equipment were this easy to install,positive
beware of kingston rebates of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product \( s \) but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a 50 mail in rebate i promptly \( as in the day after i received the item delivery \) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer \( think huge online e tailer \) the rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of 1 business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer well now what i can t re send the original \( it was already in their possession \) i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i re sent my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another 6 weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply wouldn t honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i couldn t really submit to their requirements if you re looking for a ram upgrade i d suggest you look at a quality company like ocz \( the best \) or patriot geil or corsair if you re looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are value driven products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better value to performance ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams,negative

i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition just a few months ago i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material or created a design where it won t rub against the laptop really stupid design it may have protected against some very minor scratches but likely i m worse off for using this cover \( scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity \) i don t think in the long run it was worth 40 and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money,negative

i really tried to like the via michelin bought it with every intention of loving it in march 2007 but i feel compelled to tell most of you to keep shopping i bought it due to the excellent price small thin size \( compared to garmin \) i thought how bad can it be i ordered it and had it shipped to my door then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it this is because my other gps units were in other cars with other family members already on other trips i bought this one as a budget gps optimistic that it was new and had the sirf iii chip but before long i hated this unit all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me and i will tell you about it below first please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with other gps units or they didn t spend much time with it before they reviewed it or they haven t had experience with gps in 4 years which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing for positive reviewers if this is their first newer gps and if they are comparing it to a car navigational gps of 4 years ago then yes it is quite a bit better but compared to the new units like mio 310x or the tom tom one \( both of which i own \) then the viamichelin has a horrible user interface and is horrible to use on the roads tomtom and mio often finish what you are typing for you they are intuitive and programmers have polished them but the viamichelin is very non intuitive absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly sure we are not supposed to use them while we drive and with this one it is truly dangerous even when you learn the complicated system so most of the time you have to pull over and work on it but it is no fun and even you program it if you go to another screen it loses it and you have to program the history all over you will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything and how lost it often gets i will try to give you the pros pros small form factor decent screen sirf 3 chip navteq maps four hour battery life good price for a sirf 3 chip unit cons horrible non intuitive software program clunky multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency or even if you are not in a hurry horrible speaker volume so poor and speaker so poor you can t hear it with any road noise present seriously turn speaker up all the way while driving it will crackle and is illegible i read this in a review but honestly didn t believe it until i owned it third unlike any gps i ve had this one literally tells you to start driving before it can tell you which way to go when you ve routed it to the nearest store etc think about that it means sometimes you have a 50 chance of making the right choice as to which way to go then if you guess wrong it tells you to turn around and go the other way seriously that one feature should be enough to make you say no as most gps will at least tell you to turn right from where you are parked or turn left but this one will say start driving without any direction because it can t seem to route until you drive onto a road it can t do it from a parking lot it already will have the satellite location that s not it it s a software bugaboo i think built into the programming it makes you start driving because it can t find your location or know which way you are going until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling bad software design for sure when you go to canada you have to have installed \( on another sd card \) the canadian map very inconvenient when you cross the border navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal maine literally we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn \( much slower than my mio 310 which was purchasd last year or tom tom one which was purchased this year \) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic caused us to miss several critical exits want to find poi s on the run forget it too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands it often could not find even local walmarts one s that have been there for 20 years i m serious i parked in front of walmarts that it could not find very old walmarts to be sure garmin tomtom and mio do not list all walmarts but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town not so via in several towns in maine and connecticut i parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years punch in local stores on the difficult to use poi list and it can t find any of them also punch in or look for stores like nearest walmart mio and tom tom had no problems finding several or the nearest ones it knew about from your location but with via it has to be within a certain distance from you or it will not show up as existing so you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location to try to find the store very very clunky can t tell you how much trouble that is it s so simple on the other units you get spoiled with the garmin or tomtoms this one makes it so hard and still can t find the poi s no gps finds all stores there is a limit on poi s of course but it seems the via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for bank atm s and not restaurants shopping etc believe me once you ve used it on a trip it s organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a gps themselves before i can t say enough about how difficult the interface is and when you go back or forward to another screen it often loses where it is and you have to start all over again programming where you are going going through multiple difficult steps when you lose power again you start all over when i bought it i read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought how bad can it be i thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason wrong the experienced gps users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces example on one trip my daughter began to throw up and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one when you are panicked you want to quickly find the nearest hospital this unit makes you put in the town etc if you are further than x miles or so like when you are on the interstate so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital which is horrible i had this happen before and with the mio about 3 clicks and bam you have searched and found the nearest hospital one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital truly i am sad to not recommend the viamichelin i really recommend you pass like some other reviewers have suggested and i recommend you to buy the more rapid easy to use mio with the great screen blazing fast sirf 3 and calculating chip and loud clear speaker if you are tech challenged buy the garmin or tomtom s with their awesome and easy to use software interface but don t buy this bad speakered horrible interfaced poorly designed buggy unit on paper it looks like a killer unit but in reality it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use finally there is the fun factor the tomtom one is fun the mio is fast and fun a pleasure to use even the newer garmin s are fun with their simplicity \( i hated the screen on some of the old garmins \) but the viamichelin x 930 has no fun programmed in it is not a pleasure to use although it will take you across country believe me the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker unpolished unfun clunky interface with poorly organized features and disorganized poi s and menus the polished quick intuitive menu is where garmin and tomtom shine the only thing better on the viamichellin is the screen and sirf chip some of the older garmin s use an older satellite gps chip than the viamichellin but new tomtom s and via use the same gps satellite chip but faster software routines and cpu chips but even the use of the sirf 3 chip on the via michelin cannot make up for the poor software and menu design theoretically this thing should be blazing fast but it is much slower than my tomtom or mio the only thing better on this unit than the mio is that the via is smaller and thinner and maybe the navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals but other than that the mio wins hands down by far a faster better and easier to use gps in my opinion if you are looking for software ease go garmin first then tom tom then mio and via last if you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the mio 310x it s a killer unit and it s hackable but if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going go with garmin first then tom tom i tried you mr viamichelin but you need to go to finishing school like the other gps students you are just too unfinished and rough,negative
i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and mp3 playback i agree that it could have been better it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last you cannot rewind fast forward in the song in mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again but i will have to play the entire song again i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i cannot do anymore,negative

i have had this kensington fm transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages very frustrating during the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal i haven t measured it but it seems like as little a 10 15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior this makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles if you listen to quiet music avoid at all costs if you don t it is the best transmitter i have tried sirandar,negative
\( note to brian the wap54g can be configured as a bridge i have two of them in just such a configuration took me about 10 minutes to set them up \) major modes of operation are 1 wireless access point \( its default set up \) 2 wireless client \( connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the wap54g and you now have a wireless ethernet device \) 3 wireless repeater \( extend range of wireless coverage \) 4 wireless bridge \( connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them acts as one end of a virtual cable you need two to get the job done \) a pair of wireless bridges is just what i needed but hesitated to buy the wap54g because of brian s comment that this wouldn t work because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that brian was wrong i bought a pair and they do work i rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons 1 i understand that higher end more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment 2 one must dig very deeply into the users guide \( a pdf on the cd \) to find the default ip address in order to configure this device luckily i had read elsewhere what that ip address is \( 192 168 1 245 \) other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself this will be critical info to any linux user also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is admin well it s not the only allowed userid is an empty field this had me going for a few minutes 3 something that 99 of the world won t care about i like to have more access to the firmware for example other linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low level analysis of the box and the network it s attached to i think there are third party firmware loads that enable this,positive

fm transmitters of this size don t last forever that is a fact i accept but i had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks i bought my first one from target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player the sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to oregon it was extremely noisy i plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver \( direct line of sight \) no more than 40 feet away two more days and it crackled its last and died i exchanged the transmitter at target for a new one and a week and a half later i was returning that one as well spend a few extra bucks save yourself the hassle and get a belkin,negative

i was very disappointed when i got to south america and went to curl my hair and nothing happened take a look at the product specifications it has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts i had two different curling irons with me one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts i am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for take my recommendation buy the converter by tumi instead it is twice the price but it is one piece easy to travel and works with many different types of appliances i am very satisfied with it,negative
a lot of tv for little money great picture and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end lcd s initial setup can be tricky because olevia chose to include a cd version of the operators manual though you can print a paper version from the cd or olevia website better than average sound but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width after tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many lcd s if you re using it in a bedroom you ll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on off light on the front panel rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible and wall hanging was a breeze looked at many lcd televisions and there are better choices for sure but it s hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price highly satisfied,positive
i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i don t have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it s the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2 0 sd mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i m very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future,positive
like others i was very pleased \( initially \) with the very quick installation of this router since i am very familiar with linksys products working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap i was up an running inside 5 minutes signal strength was awesome and i had an imac connected wirelessly with wpa security and an xp machine connected through the ethernet port life was good after a few days of blissful surfing i tried to connect a mac powerbook pro to the network bad idea would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely \( another bad idea \) after resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable the imac now loses it s connection every 15 minutes or so soooooo once again i m resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land i purposely stayed with 802 11g because this technology is several years old and should be rock solid i found a forum at that proved to me that many others are having dhcp problems with these routers there s no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network if i hadn t already tossed the box i would be returning it for a refund,negative
i have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my dell optiplex 260 running windows xp my poweredge 500sc 1400 and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted but this may be a function of running windows 2003 r2 on them also the 1800 has a promise sata card which locks up with usb in general making this switch a problem \( i had to go back to the ps2 kvm \) but with xp machines it seems fine,positive
we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera s return policy they grudgingly allowed me to return it as a one time courtesy with a restocking fee i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company,negative
this thing is junk don t waste your money i am a computer professional and i had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did work again if you buy one go through the setup and if it doesn t work immediately send it right back to amazon don t waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time finally amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged however you should pay more attention to the bad reviews than the good ones if the product is in fact good it won t have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional however look up all the bad reviews for this product they should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product,negative
after reading several reviews of this product i was skeptical about buying this cable i wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my ps2 but i was not sure about paying the price for these when the sony cables are about half the cost of the monster cables the reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the ps2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the tv almost discouraged me from even buying this product i decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my ps2 i am very happy that i decided to buy these cables the cable connector fits perfectly into my ps2 better than the connector on my original sony cables even the connectors fit nicely onto my tv they are snug but not too tight i believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my tv because of the 8 cut turbine connector which fits better than a standard rca plug the video and audio from my ps2 is unbelievable my ps2 pushes the video signal to my 32 lcd hd tv at 480i with these cables with my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry now the graphics are crisp and clear and i only wish i would have bought these sooner the display from my ps2 and games fits nicely onto my tv in widescreen now too before the picture was not centered on my tv and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen i would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their ps2 over the stock sony cables there are other monster cable versions for the ps2 available so choose the one that is right for you but if you want something that is moderately priced don t need digital audio via fiber and the next best thing to hdmi than this is the cable for you i am going to get the monster component cables for my ps3 next so i will be able to hook it up when i don t have hdmi available for it to use one more thought be sure to change the video output on your ps2 from rgb to y cb pb cr pr in the system configuration before hooking up your ps2 with these cables or it may not work my tv told me the connection was not supported and i did not have video output until i changed the video output setting on my ps2,positive
i ordered the cisco aironet 1231 the other day and after it arrived set it up and couldn t get a wireless signal i called customer support and was told i would be called back by a technician \( which obviously the first person was not \) within an hour we waited and got online to try to figure things out turns out that in very small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2 4 gh wireless \( 802 11b g \) to work i was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only 16 a piece which makes cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a 500 router although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me since i registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful i really hope that they improve their web site it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need i still haven t used this router since i m waiting for the required antennae i had to order somewhere else cisco routers are supposed to be good but as a warning to you the potential customer be aware that 1 \) you need to purchase external antennae with this product 2 \) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing,negative
but the touch wheel is harder to use i bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it since that point time i had a harder time turning it off pausing adjusting the volume using the back and forth touch points and setting a stop point in a audiobook this is the result of the mini being recessed into the case i took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again the case will protect your mini without a doubt but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for also make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since i nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip i ll only use when absolutely necessary now,negative
when my cds started skipping i thought they has seen the last days of spinning however this disc cleaner has solved all problems you simply put the cd into the cleaner with the label side down then you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface you only apply one even spray of cleaner then you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times you can remove the disc and let it dry completely most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations i found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick the first time i used this cleaner i was a bit frustrated with it because i noticed little pieces of black foam all over my cds apparently there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down but once i removed that piece of foam all was go this unit comes with one additional cleaning pad i think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints you won t have to replace the cleaning pads very often handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces therebeccareview com,positive

this is actually the second rcdw500c i have purchased the first is still working but it has so many miles on it that i wanted to have a back up ready when it is time to be replaced sony electronics in my experience are some of the toughest in the business the old unit may last a lot longer i am on my third sony tv in the last thirty five years the second is still working for the person i finally gave it to i am very comfortable with the technology of the rcdw500c once learned this unit is a dream to operate it is user friendly displaying all of the info the user needs for optimum use if you have questioins the manual is well written and will usually enable the user to solve any problems sony is a very reputable company in my humble opinion sony has been out in front of virtually all of their competitors for a long time their products have always been a good investment for me,positive
according to other reviews this radio compares favorably with others in its price class as a ham radio operator i can say i am very happy with the e5 it is the best portable broadcast band radio i have ever had it is the best portable shortwave radio i have ever had i was particularly interested in ssb capability it works well i called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement i use 2100 mah nimh batteries which i charge externally i have two sets the radio works well with these i found that the internal antenna by itself indoors is not enough i used the included wire antenna with moderately good results but more convient is using the telescoping antenna this antenna works according to the manual for fm and sw only but i found that extending it fully is effective in all cases ressults using this method were similar to the wire holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver there are limits to what is possible in a package this size i have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna for what it is this is a great tool it is a convient size and easy to program and use it more than meets my expectations,positive

this card is the 2 gb ultimate 120x it has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb sec which exceeds 18 mb per second frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed which is always much faster analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second that impacts time between pictures for cameras write speed is the most important but the speed rating of the card doesn t necessarily tell you its write speed for music players and other devices read speed may be more important so you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures i m currently shopping for sd cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes in order not to slow the camera down i need a fast card i have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren t necessarily even related to this particular card but are for all different sizes and speeds of kingston cards kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings this card is 1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed,positive

i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others so i can say just get yourself a better wireless router based on the reviews here several online fora and my own personal experience i can confirm to you that you have about a 30 chance of actually getting this to work and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another but why bother at this point there are higher power routers high gain directional antennae and there are even products sporting 802 11n which inherently has a better range that a b or g if you ve gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs research and get yourself a top notch router with good broadcast power i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth definitely hours \( if by some miracle everything works on the 12th or 13th try \) and probably a couple of days \( assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one \),negative

with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc \( they had just received them that day \) sorry amazon but the nano did come from you anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible it works great it fits snugly in this case yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls i have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all the belt clip is sturdy and secure the magnetic snap for closing it works great the case can be closed with headphones attached but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod,positive

i bought an airplay2 from am apple store for around 60 other than the fact that blank fm stations are hard to find in the new york metropolitan area and that you need to keep changing to different blank stations as you drive the product itself is simply terrible even if you are in a parking lot and find a blank fm station the quality of the music the airplay broadcasts is very bad the bass is almost non existent and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of this product is not worth buying especially for 60,negative

i record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc i d been using ridata for some time w next to no coasters but figured i d upgrade and go with memorex this time around big mistake they skip pixelate and freeze up i have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies i ve done were it a compatibility issue i could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media i m going back to using my cheap disks the lesson here is if it works dont fix it,negative

i use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the gps 360 device further down the dashboard this adapter apparently can t sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle i ve only used it twice first time it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half the connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable but i m going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again i don t want the connector to snap off next,negative
i made the mistake to buy the kensington laser pointer before this one the kensington is a good one very well made but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control i to not know any cheaper model with mouse function i can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the kensington together with the very practical possibility to store the usb receiver inside the unit but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter my kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as return on some applications \( exporer on windows and opera on mac os for instance \) i do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that however the hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which i prefer it the wheel system of the hiro presenter is very practical compared with my kensington i found no difference in the quality of the laser both do their job perfectly the mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it my unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both mac an pc overall i am extremely satisfied on the minus side the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours the fn label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage a bit disappointing but after all nothing really important the unit also lacks programmable buttons but i do not know any presenter with this feature bottomline this presenter works well it is not expensive and the mouse control is a true must,positive

i ordered a pair of these online a bit nervous as i wasn t ever able to hear them \( i heard a pair of jbl sp6c s the cheaper version at best buy and wasn t all that impressed although it might have been the poor listening environment \) anyway the speakers arrived we installed them \( they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling \) and i m quite impressed note that we re using these for whole house background music not home theater so my standards aren t as high as they would be in the ht case but for a 6 5 speaker these put out a surprising amount of bass and clear highs right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we re shopping for a better one and they still sound great these probably would be just fine for ht rear speaker use \( i wouldn t want any in ceiling speaker for front or center ht use \) our home theater downstairs already has jbl speakers \( studio series for the fronts and center northridge for the rears \) and i ve been very happy with them i recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in ceiling speaker without breaking the bank,positive

i don t know what the fuss is all about about this unit s fan noise after the firmware update if one bothers to do o it the fan noise level is really trivial compared to advantages of huge storage space \( or data redundancy if one should choose to use raid 1 \) the sound of the fan is about as loud as a fan from a pc workstation \( one of those dell precisions or macpro powermacs \) one of the things i wish could be different about the unit is if the raid configuration could be more easily managed by using apple s disk utility instead of using wd s own proprietary software \( which requires a reboot an annoying thing on mac osx 4 which i almost never ever have to reboot \) and then the button manager requires yet another reboot before the functionality can be fully utilized hello western digital mac is no microsoft windows where users are used to rebooting often if you want more of mac users business write your apps like a true osx app at most i should be able to just log out and then log back in to use the functionalities other than that the unit is a work horse i use superduper to backup my mac and so far have had no issues at all with it,positive

most annoying thing is that i hooked up through hdmi for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the hdmi \( i used optical \) what the hell is the deal with that at first i thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your tv or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well hdmi is supposed to make it more convenient 1 cable etc why is this necessary secondly my receiver is not working properly the sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99 of the time running the auto macc fails out manually i see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part surround left is silent as it should be occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm if i select the different output options basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing i am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as i do think the receiver is nice if its working i enjoy the ipod dock that has output to your tv as well i major concern is something is wrong with there hdmi circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well i will update when i get the replacement installed,negative

i bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week it works great when i registered the unit on line i found that magellan s website showed there were software updates for this unit \( roadmate 2000 \) i downloaded the update and after some difficulty i was able to perform the upgrade i then found that the voice prompts no longer worked i logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct i verified all of my settings and finally called magellan support the support group was hard to understand \( they are located in india \) and were unable to help me i asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say they asked that i upgrade the unit again \( although the screen showing the firmware and os versions showed the new version numbers \) but by this time i was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade this unit did not ship with an a c adapter i asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he \( tom \) informed me there was not i asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues i might experience with this upgrade and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions i asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 48 hours i was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after i told him i thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations he came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour it is well over an hour and no call so far i tried their corp office and was routed by an aru back to india i called their corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named marti who would not connect me to management she said she would send me to quality assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary i spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected i love the magellan gps units and i have three \( blazer 12 explorist 210 and the roadmate 2000 \) and each time i have had to call tech support i am very disappointed i have to say i will not recommend their products to anyone else since i am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers to be fair tom \( tech support \) did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time however until then i have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever if my wife was not already used to the unit i would pay 100 bucks more and get something by another manufacturer in summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don t expect good customer service if you need magellan s help,negative
the sennheiser pmx70 had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others i d used recently i had high hopes on first listen however these semi in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about 20 minutes i later took them on a 40 minute run the design is such that in any position i adjusted them the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear once i started perspiring my sweat poured right into the little speakers i had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces the right speaker was filled with sweat and non functional pretty much the entire run who designed these consider these headphones only if you 1 \) never plan to exercise while using them and 2 \) will be keeping them on for 20 minutes or less,negative

the good when i first heard about this board i was incredibly excited i have been playing bf2 \( battlefield 2 \) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys so it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game the interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that i have seen but the price for each is kind of high but well worth it the bad the board is constructed well but don t expect this to replace your home keyboard the windows keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run of the mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with \( i might be biased since i have a msoft ergonomic split keyboard \) in game typing is difficult at best \( with the gaming keysets \) with most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1 2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1 2 side they are all vertical \( not staggered like u j and m keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other \) the keys feel a little cheap when you push them down they don t bounce back as much the ugly about 2 weeks after i purchases this board \( and the bf2 keyset \) 9 keys went completely dead i tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to no avail i contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that i have a faulty base unit duh they are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day maybe this post is premature but i don t think i am getting a new base unit conclusion the expression great idea bad execution holds true here my opinion don t buy this board ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that doesn t do anything but look good,negative
the pros you can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it s adhesive it allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well doesn t prohibit any functions of the ipod \( i e sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on \) the cons bubbles bubbles bubbles i ve carefully applied and re applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime especially on the screen if the screen is not lit up all you can see is bubbles on the screen it doesn t do the ipod justice because it looks so cheap when applied after 2 days with this product i m already looking to replace it,negative
i am glad i purchased my cardscan 700 but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all my impression is that this is the best product on the market due to its scanning properties which are quite good there are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place pros it does a pretty good job of scanning the algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive even cards that catch and rotate as they go through producing a funny smeared image have some of their contents scanned correctly the superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product there is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards operationally the product is especially nice i can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one glancing at the screen to catch errors the card image is retained in the record in the cardscan database which is important cons 1 \) the exit path has places that cards can hang up and they can catch as they go through this happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat so part of the operation is to try to prevent that by straightening out bent corners ahead of time and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck quite needless if the exit path was smooth and continuous this wouldn t happen the problem is in the rear of the plastic case 2 \) although the product retains the image of the business card there s no way to pass that through to outlook or export it to any other format this is very unfortunate i could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one except that cardscan software does not permit copy paste functions on the image why not it s easy to implement 3 \) every time i start the program it harasses me about registering even though i ve been specific that i do not wish to it also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though i ve asked it not to do that it therefore ignores the user wishes 4 \) the data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file in a simple text or csv format there is no way to create an outlook format pst file which would simplify importing and allow for the future option of including an image outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record but apparently cardscan folks aren t even close to thinking about this 5 \) if i indicate that a data export for a file is destined for outlook the field names are not set up correctly so unless i do some heavy editing of field names nothing much other than the contact name gets across if i export directly to the running outlook program it isn t perfect but it s close enough to be usable why did cardscan get one right and not the other in neither case can i send the card image over 6 \) i was forced to install microsoft net software even though i intended to do all my exports via files i didn t get a choice if i didn t install net the installer stopped and exited without installing any cardscan software,negative

this home theater package despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality is ultimately very disappointing i m new to hdtv and hdmi so i didn t know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision i have a sony bravia xbr3 oppo upconverting dvd player scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console this unit only offers pass through video so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input \( hdmi component etc \) for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection you ll pay in extra cabling costs the hdmi on this unit carries video only no sound so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver and then from the receiver to your tv again major inconvenience and lots of additional connections the manual for this unit is beyond terrible i m astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one for example there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not some are shielded and some aren t nothing in the manual about this there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself plus side is that there is no dvd player with this so i can use my own given a chance to do this again i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output,negative
i use my lx4 2 1 system as my desktop pc speakers i got this recommendation from maximum pc since the lx4 5 1 system was 2005 s best speaker system you can view their gear of the year review here http www maximumpc com 2005 12 m audio studiop 1 html being skeptical of a 550 5 1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite i wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2 1 system as soon as i purchased cables \( fyi no 1 8 stereo to two 1 4 mono cables seem to exists as far as i ve seen so you have to use adaptors \) i was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers i wasn t used to speakers with crossovers where only the each type of speaker \( tweeter woofer and sub \) gets the right frequencies so no overlapping exists all the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality after only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound intensive games i immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5 1 expander setup if you are looking for speakers that play really loud or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie these are not for you but if you want incredibly accurate pc speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you you will not be disappointed if you buy the lx4 for your bedroom or for computer use,positive
i love the feel of this gamepad after trying several others this is the best the wireless works ok i was 20 feet away and it was working the batteries are what needs improving according to many posts i thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside with a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing i also found new batteris at interstate battery store 1 dollar each the analog sticks could be a little tighter but i like the d pad wireless is great,positive
below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks pros 1 amazing sound especially when watching dvd movies 2 very good progessive scan dvd picture quality 3 simple compact and all in one design 4 remote control can work with various tv s cable boxes and vcr s 5 can play both ntsc and pal dvd s cons 1 expensive 2 no hdmi output 3 non intuative remote control 4 no headphone jack overall i love and chose the bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design i got this system because i wanted a compact all in one media center and i was not interested in getting a htib with 5 speakers i looked at denon \( 2 products \) sony and samsung i use this on my 23 samsung lcd tv using monster component video cables and while i would have preferred to take advatange of its hdmi capabilties the reality is that i am very happy with this image quality movies such as lord of the rings the matrix and hero look and sound fantastic prior to this i was looking at the sony dav x1 which is much cheaper and more feature rich however the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me for example my pal dvds cannot be played on the sony whereas on the bose it was no problem i am of the opinion that sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products to be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their truespace 2 1 surround sound feature my couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me according to bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the tv sometimes truespace works and sometimes i can t hear it i believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other if surround sound is really that important to you then you should get a 5 1 system this product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3d sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec room the audio quality from music cd s is very good and while i wish this had an ipod port as found on the denon i am very content using the aux port,positive

the mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking i use it with my apple mac g5 the optical tracking is great no moving parts the scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents i just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable less buggy i had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options functions and less bugs,positive
this is our first lcd tv our tube tv finally died my wife actually picked out this unit and consumer reports also recommended this unit we purchased it directly from amazon on january 23 2007 i wanted to wait a couple of months before i write my review to see if anything happens but to my surprise the tv is still running and there have been no problems we have digital hd and the pictures are great it took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast however if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat but overall its a good buy for us,positive
the mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse i have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse this is not it unfortunately with this one the sensor doesn t stand still my screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there the arrow jumps in all directions about 2 3 arrow spaces around don t be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse my old optical was better,negative
i have been using memorex dvd r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player recorder not all of my recordings were successful no product i know is 100 perfect but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media this 50 pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping moreover i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon after trying many dvd r blank media i found memorex dvd r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance,positive
bought it for my wife and she loves it it keeps track of where you were and restarts from there the display is small \( no fancy menus like ipod \) but works well sound is excellent be sure to install the drivers and software the software is small simple and easy to use or you can just copy paste files onto it if you don t install the drivers it only works at usb 1 1 speeds and takes a lot longer to load songs with drivers you get full 2 0 speeds,positive
before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader,negative
the cord design of these is terrible you ll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from your right ear to your attachment point this is especially agravating for right handed individual \( pshh hardly any of those \) why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player \( or whatever \) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short i always use the extra extended cable which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use the sound is good for the price \( doesn t compare to my normal set of headphones \) but sporadically i feel like they are hurting my ears \( not in a physical sense \) i have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or \( more than likely as i ve never had this before with other headphones \) improper sound design of the speakers question is though would i spend the 30 amazon asks for them yes as they are definately the best in that price range but don t go to best buy or circuit city to get them as the price will be too high i expected more from sony,negative

i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it s the best feeling keyboard i ve ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended,positive
the one in our bedroom wouldn t always work couldn t hear the kids calling i was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice both my dell charger and thinkpad charger had the same effect even without the laptop plugged into the charger if your having problems i would start with unplugging other things first overall these have been a godsend wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house used to drive me crazy,positive

egad upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it s thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity,negative
i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks,positive

i sincerely hope ipods have improved i bought a 30g ipod photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently outside the warranty \( which of course goes from original purchase date not replacement date \) it s kaput again now if i have to pay 275 for apple to fix or replace a three month old player no way three players on the blink each after a few months that isn t just bad luck that isn t even mentioning the difficulties with the itunes software or if you change computers i get a new pc and have to re transfer 100s of cds how lame that negates all the convenience of the large capacity \( i wish other mp3 players had the storage space the ipods have \) i just can t justify spending more money to replace this limited inferior pos again so essentially over the last year i have spent about 1 a day to have a player and now i m left with nothing i will be buying a different player i will spend far less than 275 and get something that will last more than three months is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use obviously not an ipod unfortunately i can t transfer the music i spend hours and hours loading up \( over and over \) what a waste of money and time,negative
i was happy with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works great for airplane rides really helps cut out that background engine noise my problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by targus \( cheers to them \) the second set broke too in a different place the deisgn of these just isn t very sturdy i m gentle with my stuff too so either i had bad luck w two defective units or they re just not made well,negative
installation time was only about 20 min hook up the digital and analog cables and it configures itself it took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me but once i found it i was really pleased with the size and clarity music composition is much easier with the big screen one small con was the stand is not adjustable but it fit perfectly into my office space so i didn t need the adjustment the video quality on this lcd is amazing ronnie be,positive

i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices \( all had the same description and specs \) it worked for about 2 weeks and then quit a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose since then it has come loose twice more so i just don t use it anymore when it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution,negative
the case looks great and fits well but it s nearly impossible to remove i had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time i was afraid of hurting both the case and the ipod in addition it s too wide in the case to dock in my logitech speaker system i might have considered keeping it if i could have just snapped the case off for docking,negative

in general lexar s usb drive does its job just as well as other usb drives there isn t much of a difference except for the following 1 \) portability good it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain bad this rubber holder only lasts for so long \( in my case 6 8 months \) 2 \) it is extremely durable this drive survived a full 30 minute \( clothes \) washer cycle when i took it out of the washer i thought all the data and the drive was gone for good to my surprise \( after letting it dry for a day \) it worked just fine this is amazing i have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes \( not using all of my weight though \) a few times on carpet and concrete and still works fine finally i have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it s still fine 3 \) looks good it is very easy to see since it is bright red bad it is fatter than other usb drives and it is bright red the drive is pretty ugly it maybe good to note however that the drive s structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse the bright red color s advantage has already been mentioned above,positive
very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my epson stylus cx6600 compatibles do not compare,positive
i bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it s worked beautifully clear and easy to use once downloaded onto my computer i used the olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews this allowed me to listen on headphones control the progression \( and backtracking \) of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly this voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time i had to take trascribing the interviews well worth the price i d recommend this combo highly especially to other journalists,positive

just a note to those who ve been having trouble opening these cases without breaking them if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together you ll be able to open and close it ok don t sand too much and just do the top knob or it won t hold together i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive so i wanted to make them work hope it works for you,positive

i had an old palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer but it ate batteries and wasn t rechargeable so when i got a newer computer without a serial port \( and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial usb connector \) i decided to upgrade thought it d be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well \( i don t own an ipod or other small mp3 player \) but i didn t need many features beyond an organizer \( didn t need for e mail etc \) and didn t want to spend much over 75 pros i like the palm interface very intuitive calendar contacts work well plays mp3 s syncs well with outlook computer plugs in to recharge all cords came with it easy to download new software \( i recommend blocks it s similar to tetris \) cons or caveats display when viewing calendar in full month mode i have trouble seeing any entries unless i view the screen at an angle not a deal breaker but a little odd they probably improved this with newer \( pricier \) models but you get what you pay for i can read all other screens just fine haven t used it to display photos i don t think i d use this to do that resolution isn t worth the effort expansion card warning will not read any card over 1gb size \( i had purchased a 2gb card with the intent of putting mp3 s on it and listening to them on the zire wouldn t read it didn t realize this till i read the fine print fortunately i have a camera which takes sd cards so i can use in the camera \) listening to mp3 s this really isn t gonna replace an ipod for features they do say that listening to mp3 s uses more battery than other functions i would agree but then i ve not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player so i can t really say functionally mp3 s play just fine with realone player sound quality is pretty good but i have noticed a hiss background noise when using earbud style headphones it s a lot less noticeable with outside the ear style headphones recommendation outside the ear style headphones with an in line \( cord \) volume control if you re in a quiet environment the lowest volume level on the realone player isn t all that soft with non volume adjustment headphones the lowest volume level \( there s a slider bar on screen \) was the loudest i wanted to hear headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem overall it s been worth the for me as a replacement for my former m100 and it works ok as an mp3 player as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis,positive

i use this 1gb card in my sony playstation portable and it is awesome the tranfer rate using the usb 2 0 cable to the psp is very good and i love having all that storage space for movies music and images i got the ultra ii because i had read that sandisk outperformed sony in speed tests and i have to agree the tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32mb sony card that came with the psp for an extra 5 10 i got the ultra ii that has a warranty and better performance i think it is well worth it,positive

we used this remote to program a sony av rm3000 remote but we need more flexibility for our htpc in hindsight we should have bought a stand alone ir unit and something like the girder software or maybe just an ir wireless keyboard this is not a remote for those seeking flexibility or those who like to customize their media experience this is an excellent remote for those who want out of the box usability and don t want to bother with customization it s well built and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for pros comfortable shape sensible layout high quality feel reasonably compatible with many programs cons doesn t do absolutely everything in every compatible application only four somewhat programmable keys with limited option,positive
this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too,negative
the azden transmitter receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews as an aspiring video maker it was a product i should have bought a long time ago mine is the 9v powered model not the aa but it has proven well made light and easy to use there s something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit i find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise the din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information,positive

no free lunch you get what you pay for is that the verdict on this product well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it i need disc binders and the case logic brand while being the original is pricey low cost alternatives are needed but not at the expense of quality and tco \( total cost of ownership \) but the flap about poor customer service \( rebates \) and poor quality \( zippers and sleeve binding \) is enough to give me pause so if someone from xtreme s management is paying attention fix it or be content to lose business price isn t everything to everyone in the markt for your product,negative

my girl and boy both love their players the really likes the sonic games and the ability to connect it to the tv on a tv the 8 bit graphics are jagged but he does not care and the games are playable the builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything the players have a nice lock feature to disable the controls so that the movie is not accidentally stopped they have both dropped the players serveral times and they both continue to work well the only problem is that the had figured out how to remove the battery pack she does this at times then gets upset the movie stopped the players come with everything ac and auto adapters a remote control earphones built in stand battery pack and the wires to play the movies and the games directly on an a tv with rca jacks,positive

ok i bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain hey 5gb for less than 100 what a deal once you get the hang of loading and working with the windows media player its not a big deal to load unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs \( which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs \) you get really good at it had it for about 4 months before it stopped even recognizing the hd and no longer worked at all i thought maybe the reason was that i had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better right so i stupidly bought a brand new one again less than 100 this one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within 2 months of reciept and i just recently got the not recognizing the hd message i am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight i am 0 2 with these players so i don t believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back beware of this product,negative

i agree with the other review sony brand vhs tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years as a almost life long user of sony premium grade tapes i have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality i get when i record even off my dish the picture is never up to snuff with what i see when i watch the show as it is being recorded for the past two years i have been able to notice the differences when i am watching something on a sony tape the flaws have become to big to ignore i will be buying tdk from now on and i suggest you do the same sony used to make a great vhs tape but i guess they are concentrating now on making more playstations,negative
i bought this item since i always make a lot of notes from books and other papers and don t want to type it in manually anymore this scanner probably like any other model needs a little training to get it right over the paper but once done it really works and faster than typing i dont use the addressbook or options with your gsm but they are no doubt very handy i just scan in from papers and beam it to my laptop both infrared and the cable work the cable is especially great for using the scanner live on the screen the scanned text appears on the pc as you type the dictionary also comes in very handy it must be a very complex product but just like the ipod or zenxtra mp3 players they work so buy one and save some time excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes or studies or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e g,positive

this is my second one of this model i burned up the first myself when we moved and i accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it \( too much voltage smoke \) i found it easy to configure set up wep keys mac locked everything using the web based interface it worked great with our linksys media extender we watch recorded tv from our media center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device no problems whatsoever hasn t slowed down my internet connection either i am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work,positive
i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work,negative

recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one there isn t really anything special about this receiver but it a solid one the two year warranty tells me they stand by their product in case of a problem \( hopefully i won t need to use the warranty \) it gives good clean power and sound don t let the 75w channel fool you this is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power time will tell however how well this receiver performs also for the price amazon was selling for i couldn t pass it up,positive
i bought this system recently after my panasonic dvd surround system broke i was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on amazon and other sites for that matter but i couldn t find anything like this value and decided i could just take it back if i didn t like it well i love it the sound is great subwoofer is awesome i do not hear a hissing noise at all this sounds so much better than my panasonic which broke and that i had paid 100 more for,positive
rarely do i write a review but this product is so bad i had to expecting sony electronics to perform well what a disappointment this one is a bummer save your money there has got to a better under cabinet radio out there while the concept is good and the design sleek don t be fooled by the packaging nothing works well fm reception is poor sound is terrible controls are not intuitive to top it all off a year after purchase \( yep the warrantee just expired \) the cd player decided to only play the first track of any cd inserted forget listening to the rest of it this product is really zero stars i ve tossed the whole works in the garbage,negative

my first and main complaint about this product is that it does not fit the 60gb ipod video the 60gb model is thicker than the 30gb and this case won t close around the 60gb ipod a secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a 30gb ipod from shocks there is no protection for the screen it s just a hole in the case \( like the hole for using the wheel \) and i just require more protection for my video ipod a third \( minor \) complaint is that there s a non removable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket i m returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too,negative
i recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required i didn t know that i would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board that s ok i was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit,positive
i got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my mbp \( silver theme \) someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should or in the wrong way but mine works fine cons light indicator shows exactly which usb ports are in use small in size has usb port on top which comes in handy enough usb power so far i didn t have to plug in the power charger yet comes with a usb plugged light comes with a extended usb cable \( for you to connect the hub to your computer \) the usb plug is silver transparent in color which looks kinda nice prons it camed with some minor scratches on the hub s surface although i just took it out from its sealed package carefully those surface scratches aren t too noticeable \( didn t want to return it and waste time money \) as many have already mentioned the usb cable is connected to the hub permanently other thoughts the usb cable connected the the hub is pretty thin it d be a good feature \( look less noticeable \) f you treat the cable nicely but if you are harsh on the cable it feels like it may break will be great if this hub has firewire ports but i m very happy with this item,positive
just a heads up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them given the verbiage on the box it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner i m not ok with deception like that,negative
these batteries didn t last at all they worked ok in my remote control for my radio but on everything else the quality was either below average or just horrid my digital camera didn t even turn on with these only recommended with low powered devices actually i d recommend a rayovac or an energizer rather than these i know they re only heavy duty batteries but the quality is still below average,negative
i purchased the transmitter because i don t have an aux input in my car the product works well i live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio one review mentioned the sansa player won t fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on i use the silicon case to protect my player i took off the belt clip that comes with the case the player and case fits well enough in the transmitter,positive
i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which wouldn t fit in the normal outlet at the same time it s small rugged and light so it s easy to pack,positive

i purchased one of these radios before christmas and it works great i decided i wanted another for work so i ordered another one i recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the preset weather stations are off the mark and the only thing i can pick up is distorted and garbled they sent me a replacement and it too is off station at this point i m wondering if the first one i got was the exception i do not reccomend this product unless you just want an am fm radio that part works great this will be my last first alert purchase unless i can try it out first,negative
i purchased the lj3390 to replace an existing lj3320 the 350 rebate available until the end of oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase my main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the lj3390 over the lj3052 i now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully all run xp sp2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection software installation went flawlessly while i can t comment about hp versus other vendor software i can say that the lj3390 software is a major improvement over that of my lj3320 scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2x quite likely more like 3 4x printing of complex pages is also much faster exactly what i would expect from a newer generation print engine and an hp laserjet printer all in all i am very pleased that i upgraded it has met all my upgrade goals printing is faster scanning is much faster the network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on i haven t played with the fax side yet but am hoping this finally let s me retire my trusty standalone fax machine,positive

do not buy this product it is incredibly slow by far the slowest usb drive out of the dozen or so that i ve used it handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files i attempted to copy 50mb \( 1500 files 800 directories \) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy that s roughly 27k second deleting the files was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything for kicks i popped in an old 128 mb kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds bottom line is don t be fooled by the drive s small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesn t perform,negative

i needed a replacement receiver for a fairly modest home theater system i wanted a bare bones 5 1 system \( no 6 1 7 1 1kw audio power satellite radio capable etc \) i only use the receiver as an audio switch and let the tv handle video source selection reviewers of the sherwood rd 6500 liked the audio but thought the set up a little confusing being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me the price was certainly right about the cheapest thing around \( at \) i bought the unit and have been completely satisfied i would have given it five stars but heck nobody s perfect i had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality \( full disclosure my ears are 79 years old \) the unit has one optical digital one coax digital and several a v inputs the remote lets you pick video 1 3 cd tuner and aux inputs you tell the system which audio source to use for each of these one time and it remembers i liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present i was surprised to find how many premium hd movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in hd either i also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them on the negative side i like other reviewers bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub woofer is required,positive

one of the few of these type of items available on the market i bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews i had received some free drives from newegg \( seagate \) and needed to house them this was a no brainer set up the utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off \( xp pro sp2 \) the firmware was one rev prior so i updated it absolutely smooth as silk reformatted the drives i chose the raid 1 option and ext3 format i like the fact that you can specify raid size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume the drive is fairly solid the fan is not very noisy the front slide up access door is a little kludgy good user interface i was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen raid and ext3 the only thing i can never get to work and it is 100 my lack of knowledge is the email alerts i couldn t get infrant to do it and same with this one as an aside i love amazon and newegg great retailers both of them,positive

i bought one for a relative last christmas saw how convenient and easy it was to program so i bought one for myself this march it works just great the setup software programs the 670 easily and the logitech remote replaces the remotes for a hdtv a dvd home theater a v receiver a dishhd dvr receiver and a psyclone psc01 source selector one button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity i like the color screens and icons on the higher end logitech remotes but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use function wins forms this time round all is not rosy though added the sony ps3 to the entertainment arena the bluetooth requirements of the ps3 leaves it out of the ir rf remotes inner circle consider this if you need a combined solution for infra red rf as well as bluetooth devices \( the sony ps3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case \) fully backlit is a signifcant bonus none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features short version this cool tool really works and should satisfy most think out of the box though if you have a sony ps3 tied into your entertainment network click,positive
this product works great for my ibook g4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case although it seems like i m constantly getting new smudges on the screen don t expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time though mr clean magic eraser works well for that but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard,positive
unlike the first reviewer my experience with trigger finer has been a good one at first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in impulse \( ableton live \) once i realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze i suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as m audio states it is program and play however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless the htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers,positive
everything works fine except for two flaws in excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings i will never buy logitech again,negative

we had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam we would get an error message and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while we finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program after i had to ask to speak to a supervisor \( the tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when i had already installed several before contacting them \) we have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again the ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working we still haven t addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem i hope hp reviews comments on this website occasionally i would like them to know i have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position also hp tech support is very difficult to deal with at best i talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible english i am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported hp are you listening,negative

the pci bus does not have the bandwidth to get you gigabit speed you will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a pci gigabit card even with jumbo frames your motherboard has two pci busses and sometimes has three depending on the chipset and the manufacturer the internal devices like the keyboard mouse floppy internal network usb firewire and more will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses you will have to run sisoft sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the pci bandwidth it can get but that will not be close to gigabit speed either best case on 33 mhz pci is 300 megabit even if you can find which pci bus has the fewest bandwidth consuming devices on it the 33 mhz pci busses in all consumer pcs cannot handle the bandwidth of this \( or any \) gigabit card anyway if you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 mhz pci pci x \( not pci express \) 64 bit pci or similar but you re going to pay lots of money for that worse yet that built in gigabit interface might still be on a 33 mhz pci bus and always sharing bandwith giving you less than 300 megabit speed it probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework,negative

opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked simple as that i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only \( very minor \) problem there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone,positive
i ordered the unit twice and twice i received a carrying case not the adapter i returned both and ordered direct from cobra when i had called customer support for amazon the second time i got connected to india of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong i guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says,negative
this thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and i constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place the slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the hold feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off the little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and i was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod i finally just gave up on it and returned it i bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag i think i ll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options was this thing even meant for the gen 2 nano,negative

had this set of speakers for close to a year now they really are nothing special for the price one problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift \( if you lock in a signal at all \) they do come with power cord to plug each speaker into ac i have outside wiring so this is no trouble two if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out if you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone and mounting them in a high traffic area \( i mounted mine high above head level \) don t purchase them,negative
other than the power switch is not easy to see the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you even using it for church meeting recording you would not get excited for its sound quality if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm ms907 you may like the sound quality of that microphone if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice try the akg wms 40 wireless system our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one,negative
the product didn t do what it said it would i cut the power to use it in my car \( i shouldn t have assumed it worked properly \) so i couldn t return it and ended wasting 50 i was extremly dissapointed in this product,negative
this sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don t have your laptop or a dictionary handy the interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best i ve ever used on this type of device moreover the access times for dictionary and thesaurus lookups are very fast the phrase search function is a little bit slower but not intolerable there are also crossword puzzle and anagram solver functions that i have not used but i imagine work fine another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single aaa battery not some watch type cell battery the only negative is that it does not have a backlight for the screen but neither do many of the other comparable dictionaries hopefully sharp will smarten up and put that in a future version of the pw e550 i believe this is by far the best electronic dictionary you can get for less than 100 and no i do not work for sharp electronics,positive
excellent product very ergonomic easy to set up and use wireless works great i would recommend this product,positive

my wife purchased an hp photosmart 8450 printer as a christmas present for me i installed it and it worked perfectly for one week then the colors started to change photos had extreme amount of yellow in them such as yellow faces and hands no proper flesh tones i call hp support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured not the purchase date i was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that i had i was given a case number but when i called hp back stating my case number they said that this was no longer a free call i explained it was an extension of the first call but they refused to work with me i think hp warranty policy stinks and would not purchase another hp product as long as this policy stands,negative

do not buy this unit i have tested the vosky iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit and why are the so small the are so small as to be practically useless the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons bottom line wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom \( even the polycom computer calling kit is analog what is the problem,negative

i ordered this television with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that i would luck out and save a bundle but you get what you pay for every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware what does this mean to you for me it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the tv and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again resets system resets power cycling unplugging components didn t help my tv was completely bricked a search turned up threads on websites like avs forum with other owners of sharp tvs in the d4u and d6u series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase for them the fix was a visit to a sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the tv i say a visit because sharp does not cover in house technician visits for tvs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled so here i am 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no tv to show for it instead it sits at the authorized service center \( because sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either \) i m willing to bet all of the inventory of d6us that tigerdirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4 1 2006 check the serial number on your tv if you do order one if it begins with a 501 512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmware upgrade from sharp \( 1 800 be sharp \) regardless of whether or not you re experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while sharp s warranty is still in effect for you,negative

i bought the ads upconverter because i bought a hdtv only to find out that my cable co didn t offer hdtv and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer hdtv \( too many trees around my house \) i wasn t expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing hdtv picture but for 550 i was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable when i first turned in on i asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought she looked at the tv and said okay i m ready turn it on i said it is on this is pretty much the reaction i had also when i looked at it the image i got for my digital cable was certianly different but that s all it was different it was not noticably better in fact in some instances i though the picture was worse i called ads tech support and they kept insisting i try it with my dvd because that is what the product is best for \( even though that s not what i got it for \) so i did and to be honest i really preferred the picture i got directly from my dvd over the picture i got after running it thru the upconverter it didn t matter what display format i put it in it just didn t do anything to improve the picture save your money if you can t get hdtv don t expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing,negative

for the first few weeks it worked fine however it started skipping and stopping dvds after two months i called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty no case number was given at the time the unit was shipped via ups and received on 92nd days from the purchase date and they charged 50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired i called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because i don t have case number issued within warranty period in addition please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well next place for my dvd player trashcan sigh go buy another brand with 1 year warranty unless you purchase extended warranty along with this unit pros cheap dual screen comes with gaming pad detachable screens which is very easy to use cons sub lcd screen isn t sharp as main i thought it was defective for the first time all the games are outdate,negative
one lvel up from the es30vs much more capable of the last generation the es35vs is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and most professional needs as well remote control is easier to use than the last generation the addition of the dvi input gives it ease of recording from camcorders with a clikc of a button i am very happy with this uni,positive
this has a nice size screen it only has 3 buttons play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button i just found this out by trial there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital this would only last a second or two at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them the volume control is on the side as well as the power button it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me,positive

it s speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there s no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin,positive
the chip works just as advertised i have had no problems with it it was easily formatted to my kodak camera and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video great product i would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price,positive
i hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the ipod and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches thanks for a fantastic product,positive
this product costs too much for being such poor quality i can literally just pull the cord apart bare handed without using barely any force at all and after it s torn apart there is no hope of repairing it no matter how much time effort and thought you put into it it s impossible i m pretty sure that it s inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another the only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality and their comfort the sound quality sounds a little better than the normal ipod earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore but if you plan on using these while you re leading a busy active life i guarantee that they wont last a week i heard that these earphones are the best i found out that they are indeed some of the worst and sadly i found that out the hard way,negative
after looking at 250 00 mounts i was unsure about order at this low price this is a great well built unit i would have no problem putting a 130 lb unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions hardware for most walls included well painted with no rough edges mine was installed over wall board into wood studs i used the awl to make sure i hit the studs dead center delivery from new york to sarasota fl was 5 days can t bet that,positive

these speakers are big in size but short on performance except for the price tag not much else excites one about them they make a good surround sound system with the sony 3 speaker set for surround sound but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub these speakers lack bass inspite of their size and sound quality is poor at higher volumes,negative
i m not a serious piano player just casual don t have room for a piano so this serves my purposes i just want to entertain myself if i were a professional who played in public not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard because it doesn t have a fullsize keyboard but for practicing and casual playing it s great it has more features than i will ever use,positive
these speakers in one word suck i made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap i guess i forgot the old adage you get what you pay for didn t i they worked okay when i first installed them in a week i got bad signals and the speakers didn t work properly worse purchase i ve ever made don t make the same mistake i did please spend the extra money and get quality speakers,negative

luckily i didn t pay a penny for the motorized skipdr as it was given to us as a prize i have the original \( manual \) skipdr which worked every time and i always end up using it instead it has more than paid for itself in repaired cd s 20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang the motorized version didn t come with any deep scratch sanding pads which i need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine and won t start turning so i have to squeeze it together to make it work,negative
i have just started with an apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all they didn t sound real good and didn t come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears what s the deal with that next came the old sony mdr 027 head phones from the closet the sony s have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now they worked o k i guess but in comparison these jbuds sound much better than either of the previous ones i m now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine i m hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models crisper highs great mid range and responsive lows set up was fast too just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running the jbuds actually stay in your ear wow what a concept they are also very comfortable due to the fact i forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing the cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket if you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie better too much than not enough so back to the closet with the sony i guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks i couldn t have made a better choice for the money and quality you should do the same another quick note the shipping went great not too long at all and with standard usps thanks amazon,positive
i have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts all in all pretty pleased with the purchase it was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my ipod mini there are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models panicked at first because they didn t have one for the mini but it was already installed on the model cons light dimmer has three settings but even the lowest is too bright you can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote no ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week for example 7 00am monday to friday no alarm on weekends wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset \( by you \) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle sound is great for an alarm clock don t think it will compare with a mini stereo or bose sounddock would buy again at the price,positive

i bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it the first unit i received would not turn on at all i contacted philips tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense fortunately amazon has a very nice return policy and i sent it back to them instead amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit the replacement stereo arrived in short order and i was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which didn t seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that i was replacing after listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a sony cmt ne3 bookshelf stereo that i own here are my thoughts 1 the fm reception is not as good as the cmt ne3 both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length the philips stereo however would hiss and crackle as i moved around the room my body interfered with the reception this did not happen with the sony stereo 2 the sound quality is not as good as the cmt ne3 playing the same song side by side on the two stereos i found that the philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the cmt ne3 the sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality also there seemed to be significant distortion in the high frequencies on the philips stereo making s sounds sound more like h sounds i also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input 3 the ergonomics of the philips stereo are not so good for one thing the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped if that happens the cd can get wedged in the cd tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove the electronically actuated cd door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top loading cmt ne3 the volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening this means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting finally the stereo is a bit bigger than i was expecting \( though i could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it \) i am in the process of returning this stereo and i will try to find a sony system instead unfortunately amazon no longer sells the cmt ne3 which i bought just about a year ago i don t understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos the only difference between the sony i bought last year and one i bought in 1989 is the ability to play mp3 cds,negative
the best at this price like the color and functions mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized great optional backlight feature,positive
they don t collapse so they aren t the most easily portable as you sure aren t putting them in your pocket you also aren t listening to music in bed with them as mentioned in other reviews the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears i tend to collect lower end headphones and why not so i do have a unique perspective on them \( or so i say mostly to flatter myself \) these compared to other vertical designs are good the sound is better than most not quite as good as the sony h ear line but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks these p9 s are simple one piece and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear the volume adjustment makes them nice for tv and computer use also if you ever listen while using a splitter make sure the other person is wearing the cans \( or whatever more power consumptiony headphones \) so you can cut your volume my wife wears cans when watching tv so when i just must watch some witty sonic commercial i just plug myself in they aren t perfect i d like to also try the sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the sony folding ones they did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my rio carbon was broken \( only volume control on the thing \) for reference my everyday buds are sony ed21lps which i highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out and can be stored in a very small area heck i even use the stupid pouch that comes with them but yeah knowing the weaknesses of the p9 if you think you d like it then you ll love it,positive
i ve never had a problem with these dvds they burn and play perfectly and i ve never had a problem printing on them what s particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole it doesn t sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds by the way i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds,positive

this notebook case is a perfect fit for the macbook and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags it is exactly what i was looking for,positive
what an amazing product for such a small price it works right out of the box but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers the option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday pc work as well using the pen for graphics i use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures it really makes a difference the unit seems well made and i like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice i opted for the smallest in the range for value and was not disappointed but i am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better but at cost the software bundle is ok too if you don t already have photoshop tools the one quibble is that at home when i installed the drivers it continued to crash my pc with my wireless keyboard installed not ideal but as i dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me but be careful i am sure there will be a fix somewher,positive

i bought this alarm clock today \( april 7 2007 \) at bed bath and beyond for 10 i wish i had seen the reviews first i bought it because of the product name small size and variety of options unfortunately i realized it wasn t a great buy when i brought it home and spent a few hours trying to keep the battery in a certain position so the clock would stay on the connections appear to be very sensitive and the battery doesn t stay in place the clock light is pointless it s supposed to help you see the time in the dark but unless you have the clock at a certain angle everything will appear blurry actually the screen is blurry in most positions even with the light off as for the alarm it s pretty quiet if you re a sound sleeper or live in a noisy environment this is not the clock for you you ll only hear the alarm if you sleep with it under your ear a final note on this product the clock has been on for almost an hour without any problems but only with the battery cover slightly open if i close the cover all the way the clock shuts off if you want an alarm clock that will last awhile i suggest buying something else you get less than you pay for with this model,negative

my company purchased two of these phone a month or two back for office use previously we had an at t which i ll probably never own again after having a panasonic the phones have great voice quality plus some nice features you don t always find like the hold option data port on the back and a nice lcd screen displaying date time missed calls messages and in call timer i do wish however that the lcd was backlit another great feature is the fact that it displays the associated caller id stamp with the message that is playing no more guessing who left the message when the phones have been standing up beyond our expectations and i plan on buying panasonic phones our next time around,positive

these buds are definitely a step up from the standard ipod buds they stay in your ears much more easily \( without the foam black covers which are easily lost \) the sound is at least marginally better and the overall construction seems to be better you can t do much better for the money however if you re willing to spend a little more the jlab jbuds are the way to go i own both the gumys and the jbuds and the gumys are my workout pair and i use the jbuds for everything else but if you re looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the ipod buds the gumys are the way to go,positive
there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger it works fine however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me 1 the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case 2 the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 better sound quality,negative

i purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since the buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use but most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform when i clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages i know some may be thinking i haven t configured the settings correctly but i went over it several times and couldn t get it to work right what s even more frustrating is the support at razer is non existent they never responded to my email questions which i submitted several times before giving up i ended up buying a wacom intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more i am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse pen tool for my needs don t buy this product i would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option at 43 65 it s a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money,negative

i m sure it would work well somewhere just not for our small business i put it behind an adsl router and used it to authenticate pppoe it was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected after hours on the phone with tech support from linksys and the dsl router people nobody could help while it connected it did work very well it just did stay up too bad,negative
i was very excited to try this product on my powerbook g4 it worked the very first time but after a restart it no longer worked was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again it was fruitless so i dont recommend this product as i m truly upset with its performance,negative
not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it ll do fine careful there is no plug in at the back so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it s easy to use and pretty cool looking ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff,positive
i writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht i picked up a few urs don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors that s the kyboard nome i mt ba to to y na o y n acino esr i ia ok switching over to a wired keyboard the above mess was me trying to type on the microsoft 6000 v2 keyboard i m taking it back to the store asap according to the programs i have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing but you see what comes out not once have i had a low signal warning or anything i just get random intermittent letters to appear now perhaps it s because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray but my goodness this thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet i measured and they re about a foot and a half apart i type for hours on end per day and have been typing properly for about 16 years i type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals another thing i noticed about the 6000 \( and actually was concerned with it while i was trying it out in the store \) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped perhaps it s due to the curve of the keyboard and i m just not used to it yet \( although i have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them the 4000 felt fine \( even though it has a somewhat awkward layout \) no matter what that thing is going back i m far too agitated to keep it oh there are some neato plusses i love the shortcut keys it s nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e mail my music my pictures or whatever else i assign the keys to i had gotten excited about that feature and will be sad to lose it \( even though i only had it for about an hour \) better luck to the rest of you,negative

i have a dcs 900w camera that failed within a year after that i made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced obviously i was talking to some indian people overseas that don t seem to care about the service that much and usually after a couple of transfers the line got cut off or picked up by another layman during conversation the line quality is very bad after a while i just decided that 100 camera is not worth the time of the calls i am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau based on my experience i would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from d link once you have any problem they just won t honor the waranty,negative
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years i purchased three for my mac and pc at home then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit currently only one still works i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd i can t comment on other ups brands such as belkin but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc s popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand my experience over the past four years has been mixed these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor battery life depends on many factors so i don t begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable i bought apc branded batteries and can t explain why the recurrent failures i m frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups,negative
when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support if you read the boards on the linksys site you ll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp s and areas of the us since this item has been released please don t waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage you ll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through,negative
as of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed the ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it youu can even find this as low as 140 or chaper im not sure why the bad reviews this is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want older versions did not allow this you should buy this the video quality isnt great but good thats why i gave it four stars instead of five it is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu you must use the ipod itself but being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks \( audio video \) is great i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd all in all its completely worth it even as a stand alone dvd player it s great never had the first proble,positive
the alarms don t pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications they repeat twice and then quit the light doesn t flash except the first time half of the time they don t work i sent it back for repair and they didn t do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day same problem it is the way it is designed but they won t admit it,negative

don t waste your money i have directv with hd \( 5 lnb \) and the signal was low signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching hd so i bought these to amplify my satellite signal they actually attenuated the signal the signal strength wasn t improved on the non hd receivers that i have as well it didn t matter where i put them in relation to the dish and receiver,negative
i m using this monster cable to connect my ipod to my receiver via an ipod dock and it works flawlessly sound is crisp and clear plus it s a lot cheaper than getting the actual monster ipod av cable the length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome it s a great way to increase the functionality of your ipod,positive
i purchased this printer for it s fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum but it s really been a let down the printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out so now i have to send 3 copies of everything i want to the printer wasting paper and ink i ve tried different kinds of paper and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at brother but it continues to do this i ve looked around the internet and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models it s really an inconvenience and now i have to purchase a new printer because it s such a pain if you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use this is the printer for you otherwise avoid at all costs,negative

i ve owned three of interlink s units but that was before competitors came to market with well designed units the interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily there is no off switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one s pocket the advance and go back buttons function most of the time but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2 3 times per 30 minute presentation although i agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this interlink product better than i do it seems these other reviewers have not compared the interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features for example the kensington pointer is half the price the case is sturdy has a no slip outer coating has a comfortable feel in the hand and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip and the advance and go back buttons function all of the time not just most of the time,negative

this kit is neat i have to admit that it comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book however the kit itself is a little pricey considering that a \) there s only 10 pages b \) the pages are only 5 x 7 and c \) the pages are not double sided the software included although as simple and easy to use as can be is so limiting it doesn t actually feel like you have made this book yourself instead it s as though you re in preschool bringing in the pictures and having teacher put it together for you you can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please but there is seldom the precise one that you really want it doesn t help that half of the themes have these cutesy scrap book elements that look absolutely ridiculous however the book itself is pretty slick once you make many many comprimises the only reason i gave this two stars is for the materials included,negative

this cable really cleaned up the display image i had been running another monster cable the 6 meter version i needed the length before because of the way my system was configured i have a review under that cable about how quality does matter and so does length at the time i wrote the review i was just ordering the cable and was posting what i had found out in researching digital video signals everything in there stands true i changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable the 1 meter version because i could now get away with a much shorter cable i installed it this morning and the difference while not earth shattering was definitely visible i use this cable to connect between the video card on a media pc and my tv \( sony rear projection lcd \) the image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows text etc and the image wasn t as clear as i had hoped while the image looked good it didn t look great that s why i decided to take the plunge and spend an extra 79 bucks the difference is somethine like going from a regular rf feed to your tv and component video cables now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming it actually brings out detail i couldn t even see before to the point of deciding to turn on fsaa and filtering so video games have a more realistic look and that they do i don t know how other brands compare to the monster cables as i haven t tried them what i do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display you can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing one more thing while i m here i want to thank amazon for going the extra mile on customer service i had a dvd disappear somehow during shipping ups said they delivered it but i never received it i asked amazon if they filed the report with ups or i did to file a claim what i got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way that is service thanks amazon,positive

i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago so far so good it interfaces very easily with the computer though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit \( if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs \) it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos the only negative that i have so far is that the volume at its highlest level is difficult to hear on an airplane you may need some noise canceling headphones,positive
this is a great piece of hardware the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me but in my apartment i would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker it s volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself the bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default the other thing is that i would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer that s not going to happen with this system you can t change that easily and yes the 5 disk changer is slow the maximum volume setting doesn t seem that loud to me but then i have the decibal settings at default all the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here it has all the flavors hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way i d like it too but i only tried rca and not the digital i have a sony 32 wega and i had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the dav fx100 reciever that works like a charm even with 5 1 sound from xbox one huge complaint i have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best i see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my tv there is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual beware four stars,positive

compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000 this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy precision what i find to be a drawback is the mouse s light weight and small size the size comes in handy if i need to flick but be sure to keep the wire out of the way as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments the change sensitivity button is in a strange spot \( at least if u have large hands \) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you re reaching with not an efficient movement therefore not applicable in games \( you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary \) these are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and i would highly recommend it,positive
i ve held off reviewing this item until i actually got some alerts and i got plenty of them over the weekend so here it is there seem to be a lot of complaints of this being hard to set up so many that after having no problems setting it up myself i d worried i d done something wrong over the weekend a number of thunderstorms tornados rolled thorough my area using the s a m e alert system for my county i received a notification for each warning i purchased this radio specifically for the s a m e alert system living in central mississippi we get tornado warnings all spring i didn t want a 2am alarm for a tornado 3 counties north of me my one beef with the unit is the radio reception even the included external antenna it s spotty especially the weather radio reception i m not sure how far i am from the nearest weather radio transmitter but living in the suburbs of madison i can t be too far if you re in a rural area i d definitely look into getting an external antenna \( it has a port for a better external antenna than the telescoping antenna included \),positive

are they the best no do they impress people who havent hear them before yes to me thats the best compliment they are much more objective listeners with no preconcived notions all i ever hear is those speakers sound so good i love those cool little speakers etc i ve played everything from bach to dio and they sound very realistic subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level at they are a steal i paid in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new,positive

it says it supports mac all over the package however it doesn t support and cannot be made to support mac files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files for instance when i drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named ilegally or uses a prohibited character it says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt ok ok is your only choice to click on by clicking on ok the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder how is that for compatibility how is that for delivering backup assurance i feel swindled the product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box it s mac compatible as long as you adopt pc conventions in how you operate your mac run mac owners ru,negative

all of the pc to stereo cbales i could find in the stores were only 6ft long due to the furniture arrangement in my living room i needed a longer cable to make the connection i was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances the 20 ft monster cable took care of both those issues for me the connections are solid and the sound quality is great it was well worth the money,positive
after reading several reviews on this unit we purchased it the majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to get in the game it took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it all i can say is wow the performance is phenomenal we have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works i cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid highly recommended,positive

i have really bad luck with head sets \( i dropped a vise on my last set really \) these are really well built headphones it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set they can get very loud and not crack exceptional base and mic is very very clear they are light but feel solid although i have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong i have very big ears that is one of the reasons i bought this head set it is very comfortable the only thing i don t like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups but maybe it help keep your ears cool maybe i really give them 4 1 2 stars i paid about 90 for them and i have no regrets so if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the sony mdr 300 mdr 400 they don t have mics but good headphones hope this helped good luck,positive

wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear gic251u 5 port usb card on a dell optiplex gx 1 running 98se \( this computer already has 2 usb 1 1 ports \) the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a inf file in the iogear supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand alone program this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager however the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going installed card seemed to work ok for a d link wireless adapter but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non iogear 1 1 ports the following actions did not help \( 1 \) swapping the card to another pci slot \( 2 \) downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website \( 3 \) three calls to customer support where i found sympathy but so solution,negative

first off i like this unit it s easy to use and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck \( it doesn t work with regular data cds \) hit the phono aux button followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp take it out of pause it starts recording instantly between each song hit a button and it break the recording into tracks pretty cool it s got great potential but there are still a few shortcomings for example i was surprised to see that it doesn t let you record off of the radio just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn t digital it s a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago i wouldn t mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too oddly the remote does have an am fm button they should just label it the radio button because when you think of it switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re tune the station too using the dial another key point is that the unit doesn t have any outputs at all so you can t pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers i would rate this as 3 5 stars but since we can t use half stars i ll give it 4 for one big reason for all it s shortcomings it works and there are very few alternatives speaking of alternatives here are a few other options 1 a standalone cd recorder i have one of these too the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck in my case my stand alone unit has two drives so not only can i record from any source in my system but i can dub from one drive to the other also my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds \( it s easier than using a pc however the song titles are just numbers \) in my case i opted not to use this for my lp projects because i no longer have a turntable i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable i might as well pay a bit more for this unit 2 crosley makes a simuilar unit but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot 3 a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it you plug your turntable or other external source into it plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality \( wav vs several mp3 sampling rates \) viola it records directly to your flash drive ipod or external hard drive if you do go that route make sure you get the plus model the older model is outdated and doesn t work as well 4 use a pc even though it will give you the best possible sound and options it s out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc or bog it down while i m trying to use it for that matter keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards then filtering the files with your favorite audio software then re burn the files to cd or mp3,positive

after my trusty archos player s display broke i figured i upgrade and get me a 60gb iaudio x5 as a journalist doing interviews i was also very giddy to get the line in to record interviews straight to mp3 a friend of mine loves his player so i didn t even flinch when i saw the price ever since then i regret my decision apparently my player has a software problem it speeds up all my mp3 files i tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing that is when i was actually able to upload mp3s because oftentimes i received error messages and the player refused to do as told so what then upgrade the firmware sure if you can make it work and i couldn t the description online is poorly written but it s essentially like this start with a fully loaded battery unplug the a c cabel and unpload the firmware now replug the a c cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware well all it does is conclude that the battery isn t full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else i e i couldn t get the firmware to update and i tried for the last hour therefore i ll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund and i ll get another archos and continue to live with its misely 20gb,negative
looking at the photo of this item i noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is not the screw on contraption needed for my explorist 400 so i was hesitant to purchase it until i did further research and found out why the plug is different you still need the usb cable that came with the explorist and have to bring it in the car too the big ac plug detaches from the usb cable and aha now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into then you screw that cable onto your gps unit as when you charge it via ac in other words this charger does not plug into your gps it plugs into your gps charger cable which attaches to your gps but i don t want to take that cable in the car with me because if it gets damaged or lost then i can never charge the unit at all not even at home with ac so i was forced to find and purchase another usb cable assembly seperately to keep in the car with this car lighter charger magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it the car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord but what good is it you still have to have the long usb cable attached to it anyway but hopefully this will help everyone that like me was puzzled by the photo of the item and the connector that isn t going to fit anywhere in the explorist 400,negative
this antenna is one of the best indoor uhf antennas but is designed for uhf only many cities use both uhf vhf for digital tv to see if uhf vhf are used in your area enter your address at www antennaweb org then look at the digtal channel frequency assignments column if any channels are 2 thru 13 this antenna is not for you do not buy any knockoff antennas sold by terk they are mostly junk,positive

my engineering classes don t allow for the ti 83 86 89 so i needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction basic vector manipulation and single variable integration for my engineering class the matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my statics dynamics and strength of materials class the 2 line natural textbook display prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have the scrolling ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy very nice the only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that i thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times but that is because i m used to square calculators also i would have like this model offered in black,positive
i bought this card for my tj25 supposedly a supported device but the problems with this card make it nearly useless it comes with a web browser that doesn t work even if the browser did work it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version the only downloadable browser that works with the card is eudora which doesn t do anything except display text \( you can t even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc are impossible \) the card is designed to work with netfront and clie mail software that comes with internet enabled clie devices obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card these programs are not available separately the card wouldn t connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors even though my powerbook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configuration required while attempting to connect the card would often stop responding and then lock up the handheld bottom line if you want a web enabled pda buy a web enabled pda don t buy this,negative

the item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so i called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks i was disappointed it was not as universal as advertised once i got the tv up it is ok and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady i did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks i had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when i got a replacement now it looks like i may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also this whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating mike d live and learn,negative

o k so i m paying 300 for a set top box with a 40gb hard drive but i can t use it as a dvr why not also the only content i can play on this set top box is content that comes through itunes that s right if it isn t in your itunes library you can play it on the apple tv this means you caqn play your dvd s you cant t play saved dvd imovie or other movie files you can t play anything unless it has been successfully y added to your itunes library also make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen tv they aren t joking about this if you don t have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen \( it won t go to the edges and be borderless \) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box any pros it has to be the easiest setup i have ever experienced with an electronic item i mean less than 5 minutes and i was set also i thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part it was able to communicate perfectly with itunes just because i plugged the apple tv into my airport extreme router that my computer was also plugged into basically apple tv saw this is a direct link i didn t think it would be that easy without having to configure something but it was also the menus are very helpful and attractive this will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and dvr capability right now it s time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better if this had only cost me 100 or 150 i would probably keep it however 300 is too much for too little,negative

i agree with the prior review of these jbl e10s however i d go to the e20s for a small room main stereo set better bass worth the slight price increase bought for rear channel \( rc \) use i find the e10s quite airy with what seems like a better high frequency response than the main e30s i just bought from a com \( see my 5 star review \) giving extremely open and detailed surround rc performance note the specs listed on a com for the e10s state bi wireable yes but unless jbl has just changed the terminals to do this that s wrong mine have just a single terminal set and don t bother with the pricey speaker mounts offered as accessories \( unless you plan ceiling installs \) as they come with two slide down screw slots attached to the back for wall installation surfing for the best price i bought mine refurbished from for a low 53 00 bid plus 18 00 s h directly from jbl and you may find the e30s e20s from jbl as refurbs there as well as rc speakers especially at the price i got them i recommend them highly well deserving the 5 star rating given,positive

i ve come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won t track right i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn t test it well enough unless your willing to do that skip this one it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul but then again you do get what you pay for,negative
i wanted a non ipod digital music player and found this to be a terrific option it plays a number of different formats and includes a lanyard which is nice when commuting on the train or for plane travel i have only used alkaline batteries so far and have had excellent battery life the menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu it s pretty easy i have also enjoyed the built in fm tuner and have not any trouble with reception even on a moving commuter train the sound quality is very good i ve been using 128 bitrate mp3 songs so far the software for transferring music is pretty easy to use although i did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue the included earbuds aren t the most comfortable especially since i already lost the foam padding but i will probably get a better pair anyway they do sound good though also the included cases are pretty cheesy and i didn t even bother with them a little hint one thing i did not like was that because of the location of the on button the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket to combat this simply turn the hold on the unit won t turn on accidentally when it s on,positive

i ve had my e 10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it s performance my interests in radio pretty much revolve around a m \( or medium wave \) dx ing and shortwave listening it s performance on a m is on a par with the highly regarded kaito ka 1103 which i received for christmas this year shortwave performance is very close however the kaito is superior in this area \( and features ssb tuning as well \) f m the e 10 is well above average but falls short of the kaito ka 1103 i ve yet to see a radio that can equal the kaitos performance in this area but the e 10 is closer than most build quality ergonomics and appearance are second to none and better than most the slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a top of the line portable multi band receiver even though it s moderately priced it s lcd digital display is one of the largest and nicest i ve seen very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight other amenities such as 500 plus memories 12 24 hour clock i f shift and antennae trim which are both useful in shortwave reception local dx switch and the internal battery charger for nicad or nimh batteries all add up to make this a radio i m glad i purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel earbuds and reel up shortwave antennae are top notch now if you re wondering why after all this praise i only gave it a four star rating and not a five it s because eton did not provide ssb tuning capability on this receiver and it s a shame because it s shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it in my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio hence they only hit a triple \( which is way more exciting nonetheless i m a baseball nut too \) and not a home run,positive

the lp to digital recording system is nothing more than a record player just a vanilla run of the mill record player you still need a sound card in order to record your lps most builtin \( on the motherboard \) sound cards have very poor audio input so this product is not suited to its advertized function i am reminded of the solar clothes dryer product of a couple of years back the box contained a rope and some clothespins the software is awkward and hard to use not at all intuitive it also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy any buyer would be better off getting audacity \( freely available on the net \) which is easy to use and has the same features i do not recommend this product,negative

i had researched for a long time before i finally made my purchase the final reasons for this purchase was the consumer reports best buy recommendation for the larger 42 version of this olevia set i had debated about purchasing a tv with 1080 but decided against doing so when i read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720 i needed the 37 set due to the entertainment center we already owned which cost 2 5 times the price of the tv so it wasn t leaving the house the tv opening would have allowed a 40 but i am glad i stayed with the 37 because the set up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40 because of the need to turn the set at angles i compared the two tvs at the olevia site and the only difference was the speakers i also saw the olevia at a friend s house and was impressed with the quality the best price was found through amazon com i placed my order on a friday evening and the set was delivered by ups in perfect condition on wednesday the set up of the tv was simple the only problem i experienced was with the remote here s the good news i sent an email to tech support and quickly i had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that i set up the tv even though i use the surround sound through our stereo i actually was satisfied with the sound through the tv speakers a small problem is that the time warner cable box remote control does not operate the tv so we do have to use multiple remotes but that s only a minor inconvenience our family has been very pleased with the tv i would highly recommend this tv to anyone purchasing this size tv,positive

i bought a pair in january and loved them sound is as lovely as everyone describes however there are something seriously lacking in the build quality the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it but i thought i d just take extra care at 1 month of careful usage the plastic covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather hardened that i could almost use them as chopsticks and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion at 2 months of careful usage the wires had half ripped from the plug which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape however at 3rd month the left bud fell completely off i am very disappointed it is one of the best sounding phones i ve ever had \( i ve owned both grado s60 and s90 and sennheisers \) but man they need to do something about making this baby last,negative
i had great hope for this product it has mostly so far lived up to my expectations here are some caveats i was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories easy listening dinner music light jazz etc you have to cheat to do this and using the manual is daunting instead of using the artist as artist i used it as a catagory code ie making one artist light jazz etc this works but you do of course lose the artist registration ability so now i can select artist dinner music and then all discs and shuffle and the unit will play a track from one dinner music cd then shuffle to another track on another dinner music cd etc making a delightful mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way i am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine so longetivty and flawlessness are not being reviewed here that remains to be seen the manual is purely awfull just dig in and try things that s the only way to get a handle on things hope this helps good luck,positive

this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges if any of them is out of ink you can t print at all if you re out of yellow ink you still cannot print a purely black white document the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that,negative

i purchased the rino 130 specifically because it also had the radio and noaa features fortunately i read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance i tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible and i was able to return the unit to amazon in time for a full refund be sure to test this yourself also the buttons are very small and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down i returned the rino 130 and purchased a garmin etrex legend c \( color display \) for about the same price i will miss the noaa feature of the 130 but not the radio this is an overpriced gps spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed,negative
anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds i know because i just did it the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire you could even use household scissors to gnaw through having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer however if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer you might as well get something with a stronger cable,negative

what company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won t work incredible my experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written it just shouldn t be this way when i finally did get it working after tweaking some settings and spending all freaking day on the linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house i do have to say the their forum is top rate the people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don t want to go through scripted support suppliers product wise a very disappointing experience people wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good,negative
the very first dvd player i bought was sony s very first 5 disc dvd changer back in 1998 it was an excellent player but as the technology improved it could no longer keep up i upgraded to a single disc sony which could handle dts and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video but i always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start at about one third the price of that original dvd changer this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player it produces an excellent picture has lots of tweakable settings has more outputs and is also very stylish looking i do have a couple of nits though my original dvd changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc i wanted with this one i have to press a disc skip button to cycle through all the discs until i reach the one i want the front of the player does have direct access buttons though i wish i still had my old remote control as i m sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality second the upscaling through hdmi produces a great image but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p in fact upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture it s also unfortunate that while connected through hdmi progressive scan cannot be turned off this shouldn t be an issue most of the time but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote but they cannot be turned off when connected through hdmi one last thing about the hdmi connection there can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using hdmi connections and digital tvs this is not a problem with the player but with the way hdmi is currently implemented this player has an audio sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem however the audio sync adjustment doesn t work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs since i need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5 1 sound the audio sync adjustment feature is useless here and that s a shame by the way there should be no audio sync issues if the player is connected via component s video or composite outputs there s also a minor thing i ve found about all my sony dvd players that i haven t liked they are unable to correctly display time remaining on certain discs or more commonly on the special features \( documentaries etc \) on certain discs i also have a cheapo philips player which has no problems displaying time remaining on those things \( even on the menu \) it s an improvement i d really like to see implemented on future players now despite the complaints i ve listed above don t get me wrong this is still an excellent player and i really love it i happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it it really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances and i feel it s the best dvd player i ve ever owned it s just not quite perfect in all likelihood it s also the last dvd player i ll ever own as i ll probably be buying a bluray or other hd player in a couple of years when that format war is over but this is a great player to hold me over until then,positive

first of all the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself i did get it quickly \( 2 or 3 days \) but i had several problems with it \( 1 \) i repeatedly tried it on my dvd player and the player hung each time i had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond i tried over 10 times and got the same result each time \( 2 \) i tried it on dvd drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well had to ctrl alt del to get my dvd player software to close on the 3rd attempt it actually did work \( 3 \) i repeatedly tried it on dvd drive 2 on my computer each time i got a message saying no disk i consider it item a waste of money,negative
i read the other reviews some glowing others well not so glowing the price was right \( 149 50 rebate \) so i thought i would take a chance i read the other reviews so i have no one else to blame but myself first off i am only interested in playing videos from my computer so i have no idea how well the image viewing or mp3 playing works i also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections my house is fully wired with cat5 therefore i am using this product wired not wireless i was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton so far so good the first thing i did was check for updates an update was found and updated successfully i then had the dsm 320 look for media servers it found the tversity server right away and i was able to see the contents listed this unfortunately is the end of the good news it s all went downhill from here 1 neither server tversity or the dlink were smart enough to view a folder of vob files as a movie they listed them as vob 1 vob2 etc so for example i clicked on my casablanca folder i would then need to click on vob 1 to start the movie when vob 1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to vob 2 i needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play arrrgghh p o s thing 2 as another review stated the ff simply does not work properly oh sure if you press ff the movie will fast forward but there is no way to stop it if you press play while the movie is ff wding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current vob more arrrrgghh this alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device which i will be doing first thing in the morning my final advice to any prospective buyers s t a y a w a y my final advic to d link great idea but your product absolutely sucks oh one more thing someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly yes the two ladies i spoke to were both very friendly their english was terrible \( guess which county you call for tech support oh come on just one guess \) it also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another i could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients which made it very difficult for the lady helping me she needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over sheesh i must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right one last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention nero recode ce so i went to the nero site to check it out nero has a list of supported media players listed and you know what d link is not one of them i will return this d link junk and purchase one the nero certified product instead i bow my head in shame as i had read the reviews but i bought the product anyway,negative

i ve been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years i ve used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday i ride a motorcycle everyday and i never leave without these first the comfort is exceptional even with my helmet on i never get uncomfortable with these in my ears i ve ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems even when i need a break from the music i leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise i ve used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable tolerable at best but most are painful with a helmet on the bulb you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep second the sound quality is fantastic great bass mids and highs i ve heard things in my music i never knew was there and i can t wait to listen more i can t recommend these enough i ve bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine,positive

so i bought this a couple months ago at first i was in love great sound quality and the surround sound aspect works well in fps games also very comfortable much more so than any other 5 1 headphones i have owned the initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly though first of all the microphone sucks i ve seen better microphones on 20 radio shack headphones these are gaming headphones and expensive ones at that you would think the microphone would be at least passable it isn t secondly the build quality is pretty bad within a few weeks the control brick started giving me problems the sound would go off on one side or the other a bit annoying this only happens sporadically and can be fixed by squeezing the sound controller not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement but annoying nonetheless i ve also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws screws that aren t properly inserted and they have a tendency that fall out now i have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone and i can t find the tiny screw so i ll have to either try and repair it myself which means trying to find somewhere i can buy tiny rare screws or have to send it in for repair i might as well send it in for repair because maybe they could also fix the volume controller really kind of disappointing for supposedly premium gaming headphones the microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or ts and the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price i bought some 5 1 headphones for 40 a few years back they only lasted a year but they had none of the issues that the razer has kind of sad that a cheap chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap,negative
my mother in law had one of these that she uses to clean her sewing machine i rebuild computers and thought how handy this would be and how much money i would save on air cans that are 5 ea and i have bought a million of i love this little vacuum attachment set it works great and has a multitude of uses and has already saved me a bundle thanx cyber guys you rock,positive
i agree that this drive can be a little slow but it hasn t caused a problem for me i keep copies of many files \( about 1 gb total \) related to a large project at work on mine when i first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes but now i just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that i don t even notice them \( just a second or two \) i also seemlessly work on the files on both a pc at work and a mac at home to me the best feature is the reliability between my husband and i we ve had several cruzer minis in various sizes and each one has worked great even through accidental abuse one of his 512 mb drives accidently went through the washing machine we thought the data was gone but when it dried out it worked fine just today i found my 2 gb drive at the bottom of the dryer it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer yep it still worked i m buying a new one to replace it \( just in case \) because i don t know it there might be some long term effects from the water and heat but i ll keep using this one for less important applications changes are good though that it ll never have a problem these things are amazingly reliable,positive

i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard it s cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically is very sturdy yet light enough for me so i bought another \( wide screen \) \( black \) version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so doesn t have to work that hard now its internal fan virtually never kicks in in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on off to make sure that it is working the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports 4 stars because 5 is perfection,positive

i am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try i have a six year old hitachi dvd player and i lost the remote i couldn t play anything without it because the buttons on the player don t allow me to select any tracks the instructions on this remote are incredibly easy it found my tv automatically because it s set for a sony tv by default when i had to locate a code for my dvd player i got worried none of the 3 hitachi dvd codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process but there s a search function to use in that situation which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip s library till one works it found one within seconds and i was up and running i think i m going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms,positive

purchased this tv december 10 after much research unfortunately for me the tv was defective on arrival when it is working it is a very nice tv but the customer support from both olevia and target leave a lot to be desired target will not replace the item the corporate policy i am told is the item must be returned via shipping you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up and once target receives the tv back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued they say within 30 days my credit card company ae says it will take 6 12 weeks all this time with no tv paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears i don t know about you but that is pretty steep now olevia though it is under warranty i again must pack up the tv in the original box ship it back to olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me the tv weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again i am without tv for a month or more while the transaction takes place if i want a tv at the time the defective one is shipped i must give olevia a 1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction either way the consumer gets screwed the television has a one year warranty i purchased the extended warranty what else could i have done i am told by both target and olevia this policy falls under the other terms and conditions i wonder why they don t actually say that buyer beware of target and olevia,negative

wouldnt buy from this bunch again the product was given as a gift my son took it home first week of january when their christmas visit was over couldnt get the scribing process to work was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix then he tried to return via amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it i am told when i contact antonline that its been to long \( january 22nd \) to return the merchandise most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for christmas and some dont even have one wont do business with manufacturer or antonline again having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that i use their credit card alot guess that can be changed too,negative
the belkin tunetalk is fabuous for using an ipod as a digital recorder i have had very good results recording various music rehearsals \( children s choir to big band \) with and without an external powered microphone \( sony ecm ms908c stereo mic \) attached since i already had the mic the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a zoom digital recorder for this type of recording i haven t plugged it into a mixing board yet i suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a mackie 1202 or better i bought a usb power adaptor so i wouldn t have to worry about battery drain it plugs into the tunetalk and provides power to the ipod no it isn t as good as a high dollar recorder dedicated mic pre s and a pair of neumann mics serious recording requires serious equipment however for all those other recordings the tunetalk stereo is a great recording option for about 60 and your trusty ipod,positive
title intuos3 tablet publisher wacom publish date unknown isbn model ptz631w reviewer robert saucier rating 5 stars in 1997 after buying a new top of the line 450mhz pentium ii system i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet oh my pressure sensitive tilt sensing pointer control assignable function pads it was heaven after a couple of years every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application my computer would spontaneously reboot a bit counter productive i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but as technology marched on my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats sadly i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away lately i ve been feeling the pull once more that urge to use a pen to do photo touch ups instead of my mouse miraculously a wacom intuos3 6 inch by 11 inch tablet dropped almost literally into my lap sleek gun metal gray sexy with a comfort grip pen \( much like my coveted pilot g2 pens \) and a mouse even better the intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities adobe elements 4 0 corel painter essentials 3 and nik color efex 2 0 le heaven just got better the intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution over twice that of the wacom graphire product line and with its usb 2 connection there s more than enough communication bandwidth meaning better tablet to application response one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else the intuos3 driver has been rock solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me i ve used all of my usual programs and have had no problems at all the tablet has also been peacefully co existing with two external drives a wireless desktop receiver a card reader a scanner and a printer all riding the same usb bus the intuos3 has 8 chordable buttons 4 at each side of the tablet to which keys macros or other actions may be assigned the default for each group are the usual alt ctrl command and shift along with space the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet holding one or more of the buttons while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand being chordable you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt ctrl s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context the ends of the strip in keystroke mode can be set to playback macros the pen with its 1024 level pressure sensitive stylus and eraser also has a duoswitch the duoswitch s two positions may also be programmed the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback with the ergonomic grip the pen is extremely comfortable to hold the 5 button mouse designed to be used by either righties or lefties is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility this is more than acceptable as with every other clickable pressable feature associated with the intuos3 the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options although i ve yet to find the fix photo illustrate article or even the design website settings i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already this feature would be the feather on the cap to me the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire \( and was on the artz ii \) sometimes having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time for the casual home user i would recommend the graphire product line this intuos3 model s srp of 369 may be a bit high where a 99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable for the pro consumer or professional however whether doing photo editing \( my primary use \) or illustration the intuos3 line is well worth the investment it s great to be in heaven again,positive

these verbatim discs are hands down the very worst blank media i ve ever encountered they re made by cmc magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world but not only are they cmc magnetics they re the worst of the worst of cmc magnetics the latest kprobe hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset the latest nero burning rom hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset the program continues non stop to display waiting for media when i use these and an attempt to abort hangs windows xp sp2 the same way it hangs kprobe curiously the media ids on these are exactly the same as that on philips lightscribe cd r media \( they re made by cmc magnetics as well \) however at least the philips are recognized by all my software and hardware quite unlike the verbatims that s why i say that these verbatim are the worst of the worst from cmc magnetics \( the philips are no prize either but they perform minimally well \) the only thing that worked with these media are the lightscribe labeling but what s the point of labeling discs you can t even recognize let alone burn i had the exact same problems with these media in both my lite on lh 201ah burner and my nec nd 2510a burner \( the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low quality media \) note that verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by taiyo yuden but stupidly they chose to go ultra cheap and turned to the dreaded cmc magnetics corp thus they lost all credibility avoid these like the plague,negative

it didn t match the acoustic wave player i bought there should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces the page from which i ordered both pieces was unclear and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player \( i know i ll be refunded the price of the first changer \) but by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished i received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers i think amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss,negative
the battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only i am very disappointed in the quality we need them for emergencies throughout the day this is a farmed animal sanctuary non profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already i am willing to change my review if we get new batteries they came on time they are good quality other than the batterie,negative

i bought this enclosure about 1 year ago i put a 200gb hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated itunes library it was a super easy setup many complain in the other reviews that it s a tight fit inside but i didn t find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in after connecting the hard drive and closing it up i simply connected it via firewire to my mac g4 and it worked like a charm next month i will have it for 1 year and i would be 100 happy with it if not for one thing the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on arghh all of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time every so often the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes but it always returns with a vengence otherwise the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year i m definitly going to get rid of it though once i find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable but not nearly as noisy it s a shame actually since i m in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my aperture library and data backup respectively,positive
this is my second projector i used an nec for the last four years but that died on me recently and boy am i glad it died i am amazed by the quality of the ax100u the pictures and colors almost jump off the screen at you also the oft mentioned ldc projector screen door effect is virtually non existant you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it i believe panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it the contrast is also truely outstanding for an lcd projector at par with dlp systesm but without the headaches of the rainbow effect couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users when i first started using the projector with my dvd player i was getting some wavy curls \( not too visible but still there \) that seemed to flow across the screeen however after about 4 5 hours of use they have disappeared so if any of you see those wavy curls just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well secondly unlike my old nec i was getting a flickering shimmer when using my hd box from my cable company the shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture there is an easy fix for this go to options overscan and you can actually crop the edge of the image and not see it any more voila no flickers and an incredible picture be aware that this is big bulky projector compared to some others out there definately not a portable one you don t want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures this was designed as a dedicated home theater projector not a portable presentation device i highly recommend this projector you ve got to see the picture to believe it i didn t think it was possible at this price range,positive

the lexar jumpdrive lightning 2gb flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160x \( 24mb sec \) sustained read and 120x \( 18mb sec \) sustained write speed capability this is one of the very few usb drives that lists the read write speed capabilities the reality of flash drives is that the smaller the file size the slower the transfer rate will be i ran some tests with the lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes 433mb 784 medium files avg 550kb 12x 4 min 3 sec 483mb 81 large files avg 6mb 54x 59 seconds 1gb 1 very large file 115x 58 seconds so even though the write speed capability of the lightning is 120x the transfer rate drops to 12x with medium size files which is fairly real world usage but don t let that dissuade you from considering the lightning the higher the speed capability of the device the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files to prove this point i took one of my great deal cf cards \( that had no speed ratings \) that tops out at 36x read 7x write and ran two of the same tests 433mb 784 medium files 3x 15 min 10 sec 483mb 81 large files 7x 7 min 48 sec so compared to the lightning the great deal card took nearly 4 times longer to write the medium files and 8 times longer to write the large files so which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a usb flash drive if the performance numbers are not specified beware what you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing i know i have several in my drawer so my bottom line advice is look for the highest rated device you can find flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow so future proof your purchase by shopping for a high rated and large capacity for now and the future \( i have no relationship with lexar or the flash memory industry,positive

the software to this mp3 player made it too much work anything that freezes up my computer has to go here s my experience i purchased this player on february 23rd and returned it to the store on march 8th i was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try i installed the software with no problem but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players i just didn t like the look of it or how it categorized the music files i did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine it had a very nice sound easy to use and wonderful to carry around i listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge fast foward week 2 i wanted to delete some files and add some new ones i opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as i did at first first the program began running really slow and then froze i ctr alt delete and started over it worked for a second and then froze again i rebooted and it did the same thing i came back to it the next day and it did it again i uninstalled it \( so i thought \) and it continued to freeze it doesn t completely uninstall off of your computer i know this because i didn t have to re authorize my computer to use it again i had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer there are lots of hidden files in conclusion had it not been for my experience with the software i would have kept the player,negative

this is a direct comparision between the linksys wusbf54g and trendnet 509ub both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector both perform as expected on windows xp installation was quirky for both after driver installation inserting into usb slot it wasn t recognized at all fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device had to disable the notebook s builtin wireless before xp recognized the device client software does not detect a device under windows vista ultimate rc2 i assume this will be true for windows vista rtm too inserting the device into a windows vista rc2 system often completely froze windows vista \( had to hold down power button for complete reboot \) had to disable the notebook s builtin wireless before vista recognized the device appears that the trendnet and linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same oem or reference design as expected evaluation results are similar 1 both devices seem to have same sensitivity similar to notebook s internal wireless card 2 trendnet device doesn t have windows xp signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried also installing on new usb ports requires extra clicks 3 trendnet device supports 801 11a whereas linksys does not 4 trendnet device sometimes crashes vista ultimate rc2 5 neither device s software client works under vista ultimate rc2 this isn t a deal breaker for me as they both work under vista ultimate rc2 networking as a usb wireless key you just lose the client software feature 6 the linksys has a somewhat useful backlit lcd trendnet does not 7 both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well 8 in hotspot mode both devices show ssid channel number encryption mode etc conclusion for xp i recommend the trendnet so save the extra dollars for vista i recommend the linksys device as it never crashed vista ultimate rc2 whereas trendnet device was gave occasional freezes,positive
i have now been shipped two iskins for my 60gig and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place there are at least three flavors of 60 gig ipods in the marketplace at present and more coming it appears so be careful which one you order the manufacturer s website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin even if you know the model number of your ipod i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake throw it away,negative

claiming that this fan s 3 speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling is very misleading on low the fan barely moves any air on high it still doesn t move much air and is incredibly quiet nearing silent in my opinion if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads this is not the fan for you the 3 speed switch is useless as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high,negative

after doing a fair amount of internet research about mp3 players and their features i was under the impression that i would go with an ipod having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years i have never been fond of the mac and have always been a little biased towards pc s this added to my reticence to own a mac product and the growing complaints about service on the ipod being a bit over priced i forged on i started reading through all of the reviews i could find on the internet and as always found a wealth of them here on amazon to my dismay all the reviews i could find on product names i knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely thats is until i got to the iaudio line the reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things i could easily overlook i love the control i am big guy with big hands and i have rarely if ever pushed the control and not had the result i was intending i have had my iaudio x5 for over a month and i have nothing bad to say in the least i am an avid linux user and it works flawlessly with linux the sound quality is phenomenal except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those the fm tuner is great \( you wont get that on an ipod \) i travel a lot and i pipe my x5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port what else can i say this is a great product with great features and it looks good too i also bought a case from zcover which fits the purpose but i think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market a satisfied custome,positive
i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough,negative

upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer the digital camera still works great the printer is another matter while this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes as we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink replacing every cartridge at once will run you about 75 at a time give or take a few the gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first 50 70 pictures after that the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register very frustrating when you re printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to in the long run i will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing quality wise it gets you in the beginning but doesn t hold out for the long run we have fiddled with it for two years enough s enough,negative
i have had this item for about 6 weeks haven t used to a lot but so far i like it this power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things it has one electrical outlet and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in the plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet but i don t know if that s the plug or the outlet on my car the only thing i don t like about this item is the no tangle cord its one of those coiled up cords like a telephone cord \( look at the picture of the item \) the cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat but if i were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet its coiled so tight that i couldn t really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched it just annoys me that they call it a 36 cord for practical use not more than probably 18 but i don t have the item right in front of me to measure it i ll still give this item 5 stars 4 5 if amazon allowed 1 2 stars,positive
i can t say enough about the tivoli am fm radio it has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well some folks might be hesistant to spend over 100 for a radio trust me it is well worth it my girlfriend s parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years still sounds great,positive
while these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape he still insisted he couldn t remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he being the model of honesty and truth must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke very effective these old fashioned recorders,positive

i bought this router hoping that some of the quality in cisco s excellent enterprise market routers would have worn off on adopted child linksys unfortunately my experience has me convinced that linksys is a red headed stepchild \( my apologies to all you red heads \) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent that being said the router does work out of the box and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home network routers my perusals of the dsl reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub 300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies and this one is certainly no exception pros this router is configured to work right out of the box you can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen the html based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use you don t have to learn one single command line to configure this router default configuration was stealth mode meaning the router did not respond to any unsolicited connection requests forming a protective black hole on my ip for most uninvited packets cons not all of the features worked out of the box several of the links in the html command pages simply did not link to anything strange that linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don t point to anything turning on the poorly documented firewall feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests sometimes the router responds port closed to all requests sometimes it responds port closed to some and port open to others \( the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next \) never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration \( with firewall inactive \) i m not sure how the firewall in this router is configured to behave but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature the router s dhcp functionality works great when it works it mysteriously disengages at random intervals requiring a reboot \( and sometimes a flash to factory defaults \) to remedy flashing a new bios image is risky router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer or file13 if the warranty is out for what it s worth i am still using this router it serves its basic purpose and while its functionality issues are annoying there are workarounds for all of them i probably will not buy another linksys but the problems with this one aren t annoying enough to warrant a return sean hennin,negative

this is a great tv bought after looking around for months receive hdtv signals about a dozen without cable box the number will continue to rise but all of the main shows and programs are in hd especially for sports fans almost every broadcast is in hd true you will only get about 720p resolution from the broadcast over the air currently but when the blue ray hd movies are out in larger number and at a more reasonable price this will become the standard and this tv has 2 hdmi ports so you are ready to go i have had another crt sharp which i have liked and this product is no different picture is amazing some analog channels dont look that great but i am at the point where where i would rather watch whatever is on an hd channel note i am in what is considered an upgraded cable section the tv has the tuner to receive hd without the box as i have said but i can t speak to sections that are not upgraded so you may want to look into that nice to receive without paying for extra equipment,positive

there is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper the cartridges are not full i just got off the phone with hp tech support and they confirmed this the cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as custom cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4x6 photos in fact the tech support rep discribed the custom cartridges as having way less than standard cartridges less than 50 full on a related note i asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my new printer were full and he said they should have been full standard cartridges so this value pack isn t such a great value now is it,negative

this is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their mac a lot of mileage i m in law school so i m constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks keys and other junk my old ibook survived tremendous abuse and after two years looked like it had been through a war the speck case protects the macbook s shell and even the screen in a roundabout way normally if you put a mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books the books will press against the shell and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the lcd the speck case is very stiff so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don t push the screen onto the keyboard plus if you put a red case on a white mac people will think you re in some secret club that has access to red macs cons it s next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands you need a buddy to get it off also dust starts to collect under the bottom case \( static \) so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning,positive

after using my im716s for about 4 months now i have a few things to say about them 1 \) price lists for 199 on altec s site 70 is a steal 2 \) quality top notch in the earphones the clip on the volume module is weak 3 \) performance bar none best i ve had these things outperform the huge logitech ear muff set i use mainly to mow in these things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower 4 \) conclusion the only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way when moving around you need to have it clipped to something otherwise it can create inner ear noise this can get quite annoying i ve also caught the cord on things causing the clip to bend away from the module it is removeable and i was able to bend it back if there were a pair of equal quality w o the module even for the same price i d go that route with that said i am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60gb video ipod,positive

i purchased this product to replace a really good 802 11g unit from linksys hoping to set up a gigabit home network with ethernet storage i initially considered the wrt300n model but the reviews were mediocre so i went instead for this newer model hoping that linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the wrt300n model i am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the wrt300n also apply to this model i am returning it after 5 hours of use on my home network set up with my current linksys 802 11g unit i am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house and all four movies display flawlessly on this new unit optimized for streaming video i was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit the movie had interruptions every 4 5 seconds this was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with g cards and n cards and performance degraded as i tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time the speed of the links to my laptops equiped with n cards was 144 mb s and was 54 mb s on those equiped with g cards so the connection seemed fast enough it might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way it might be able to perform as i expect but i don t have time to waste on such tweaking and given that my 802 11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box there is no point to upgrade to this new flawed model i ll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out,negative

a terrific idea show the current time and the alarm times all at once very intuitive very helpful unfortunately the backlit lcd display just doesn t make the grade the numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable the manufacturer s photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic the numbers just wash out it s interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer s image and from the unit i got i think that would be a slight improvement because on the one i got the orange \( backlighting the alarm times \) is about twice as bright as the green \( backlighting the current time \) and it just looks weird also fm radio reception is quite poor the line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna but that just doesn t work well no matter how i orient the cord i can t tune in a strong station just 10 miles away so back it goes,negative

length of ownership 8 weeks this puppy really reaches out my laptop s internal intel pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks thanks to some friendly neighbors i ve said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections and until metrofi completes its set up of free city wide wifi i ll get by with that thanks to this neat hawking device unless i need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices i hope the hawking dish proves durable after all it s been just 2 months of ownership so far albeit good ones note for me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off beam signals fairly well also placement by a window will help your reception,positive

ok i got this as gift so i got nothing to lose right well this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle ever since i unpacked this little thing it has been with me everywhere on the go exercise sleeping anywhere you have pockets to put it ipod shuffle is always with me whenever i needed some kick of tunes its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 gb of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me lol sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer update tunes on the go so if you are a fast paced mobile and not a control freak then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it,positive
i ve used the sd yd250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear overall the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor saving convenience i ve used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough it can also save a lot of money provided you purchase the yeast in bulk \( for example 2lb \) the single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough this takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza and when the dough is refrigerated for later use it tastes even better in my opinion like most engineered products of our age this one is full of cute features that add little value or cause annoyance the yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best if you use it you \( for the most part \) create extra work for yourself because you ll have to clean it later the dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use they make a marginal difference in baking results i only use the quick bake mode which takes 2 hours to complete let s say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings \( easy to do given the many parameters you can set \) you just push the reset or cancel button and start over right nope no such button exists then unplug the unit and plug it back in right nope the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages so the unit remembers where it left off yes but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes and after 10 minutes it will forget right nope i tried this too the unit does indeed forget eventually but it s more than 11 minutes if you plug it back too early the timer resets and you have to wait again to summarize the hardware is excellent and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber,positive

the reviewer below identifying himself as an electronics fan obviously has a deep bias against bose his multiple reviews about bose products here and elsewhere are transparently motivated by some animus against bose was he fired by bose did a member of the bose family reject his romantic advances did a bose executive accidentally run over his cat did he drop a bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe the true motivation for this guy s negative reviews would be fun to know in the meantime what we do know is that he has no credibility and his reviews \( two here others elsewhere for other bose products he s made maligning bose his life s work apparently \) \) should disregarded i bought a set of black 301 s several years ago to go with my onkyo receiver we have it hooked up to a television and dvd player for movies these speakers are in constant use both for the dvd and for music of all types the room in which they are placed is huge with an 18 foot high flat ceiling the speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day the speakers work fine for spoken audio for dvd s we can hear dialogue perfectly i feel no particular need for a surround sound system several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto i feared a ruptured speaker cone but the 301 s are very forgiving no damage has been done the cats sleep on the speakers they clean right up and still look new after five years these speakers keep on giving total satisfaction and i quite simply love them about three years ago i decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market or at least what i determined to be best after a lot of research this included a set of the gold series tower speakers from monitor audio \( the speaker cones are metallic with some amount of gold and gold connections etc etc \) these monitor audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made \( real wood veneer cabinetry with the gold cones and the black covers etc \) these speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each well i must confess as awesome as the monitor audios sound i can t really say they sound any better than the bose 301 s they can maybe handle more power but i assure you the bose 301 s will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less so when i recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom i looked forward to buying a third type of speakers i ran around and listened to what i could find on display well after much contemplation i went for a second set of the bose 301 s they just couldn t be beat and i would have gladly spent more if i had found something i liked better but i m not going to spend more just so i can say i spent a lot there has to be increased performance and in my opinion the 301 s couldn t be out performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range my first set of 301 s were black this time i went for the cherry folks these are absolutely beautiful speakers almost as cool looking as my monitor audios the black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood no it is not real wood but it looks very nice these things are simply gorgeous the kind of mod or futuristic shape which bose has designed really stands out in this lighter colored version and yes they sound just as good as my original pair i listen to soft music \( jazz typically or ambient \) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume i listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions and the 301 s don t scare away or distort at all these things would tear the house apart before they d lose sound quality so yes i recommend these highly they d still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price,positive

hard to believe this product is still being sold when it s not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods also the claims of good design i feel are overstated finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won t be long until they re shaking this may influence what music you ll end up playing through the system all said though i d be happy with it for the price if only they d update it to fully handle my ipod,negative

i recently bought one of these for our 18 month old son the piano arrived in fine shape the piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly the sound is just like i remember a toy piano should sound notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale including sharps and flats most importantly our little boy just loves playing this piano hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy including the electronic toys we have purchased for him i also liked that he wasn t able to pull off the keys try as he may they just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment,positive

the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine,negative

in spite of some of the poor reviews for this product it met all of my expectations 100 thanks to the reviews i understood that the unit doesn t have a builtin antenna or batteries which was helpful to know in advance but of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place i was looking for a small tv to fit in the corner of my bathroom and this unit is perfect for that as a bonus i can not only watch the news while i m getting ready for work in the morning but i can listen to mp3 rips when i m in the shower i ve owned the unit for several weeks now use it every day and have never had a problem playing any disk either copy protected movies or cds my only concern so far has been that i didn t receive a warrantee card with the unit i especially like the portability it s so easy to pick up and take anywhere such as watching a movie in bed and even outside \( if it s not too bright out \) for watching sports on the patio the speakers are adequate considering their size and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if i want better quality in summary i have to repeat that my expectations were set before i bought the unit and i am very pleased with what i got for the price,positive

bought these to use while doing my daily walks mowing they work 100 better than the little lipstick antenna you get with the myfi plus you don t have to use the earphones the only time i lose signal is if i m really boxed in an area that doesn t face south it actually works in some areas inside my house the sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me besides there ain t much in the way of other options this is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year so i use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when i want to use the fm tuner on the radio,positive
although i prefer the akg k701 for most of my listening this competing entry from beyer is so close that it s almost a coin toss \( one recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat \) this is surprising considering that the dt880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid priced headphones the bass is full but nicely textured not a touch of bass bloat to be found here the highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage instead of the music being on top of your these beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way these headphones don t require a headphone amp but certainly profit from one the 30 ohm version makes for more volume though the 250 ohm version is standard and best for most daily listening the dt880 sounds great but lacks a tad of the k701 s high end sparkle conversely beyer s value comfort and workmanship can t help but impress this is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the akgs and the senn 650s but listeners are always impressed by the dt880s sound it may be your best value in a mid priced all purpose headphone,positive

i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding compact headphone for work and working out at the gym if you are like me and can t stand all the earbuds out there then you need to find another solution i tried the premium zune buds at 40 bucks and the bose quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under 40 headphone out there that won t mess with your hair \( yes better than even the bose earbuds \) if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player be prepared to be blown away tight full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids you don t have to crank them either they sound rich even at lower volumes but if you do crank them they don t distort at all if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores these sound very similar but with an open air design the only negative is the comfort the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so i think i ll get used to it i d much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal \( which i had \) that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems some other reviewers complained about the headband but it sounds like they were not wearing these right once on your noggin the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort i do not think the headband is too tight it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place i might buy a pair of the px 100 s as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading the px 100 is the same exact phone in an over the head design at 40 i can afford to get both,positive
simply put the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely there are always bubbles if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard so when you close the lid the material then transfers some of that dirt right back my resolve just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft clean semi wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster,negative

it worked ok for 2 months but the kb kept on falling off when i complained i was told that the kb was not compatible with my viewsonic v37 yet it was advertised as compatible with the vs ppc 2002 the worse came when i upgraded to ppc2003 and the kb stopped working i contacted targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their kb drivers for this vs ppc i do not believe that this should be permitted if you sell something stand behind it very disappointing,negative
stylish comfortable good sound quality and utterly useless at noise cancelation great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes and you ll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight perhaps there s a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box i suggest you insist on this sure turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise but as far as i can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume,negative
its great i bought it for my husband and he loves it the zen micro fit perfect,positive
i also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by sony this 7 1 channel home theater with hdmi passthrough is a great machine that money can buy if you are looking for quality surround sound in your livingroom or your own home theater this s the product you should invest in this is a great investment for me i am glad i found it in amazon,positive

i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you can t save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you ll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me 50 dollars and it can do the same thing for yo,negative
the product works fine it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they didn t pop off,positive
i ordered the a1500 and received the a1000 i opted not to send it back when i read the other feedback on this page i didn t want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed \( as the other fellow did below \) amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product if you want you can call them at 1 800 201 7575 \( toll free us and canada \) 1 206 346 2992 or 1 206 266 2992 \( outside us and canada \) 1 877 586 3230 \( canada only \) uk customer service 44 208 636 9200,negative

not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it s now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand,negative

i bought my wife a nuvi 350 for her birthday last august \( overall we love the nuvi but the mount no \) the biggest advantage of the nuvi over other gps systems is its portability unfortunately the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature the cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well and then won t let go when we tried to transfer it \( after being attached only a couple of days \) it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield \( though with difficulty and repeated tries we have been able to move it \) what this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in the mount and the charging power wire \( which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount \) are pretty darn expensive \( 60 70 \) which is ridiculous for a portable system,negative
i bought this because i wanted a cheap no frills phone with answering system but it s performed very poorly compared with the one i had previously specifically it s very hard to hear anything on this phone even with the volume set to maximum definitely not worth buying,negative
fyi this does not fit the new generation 5 5 of ipods \( 80 gb \) another thing is that there isn t a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd,negative

this one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on that turns out to make life so much easier it has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work and go through security to get into work all without having to open my bag the remote has a velcro strap that i use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack i am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out my only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap as the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected because when things do come undone you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click,positive

works just as expected switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop \( all running winxp \) each machine takes 1 min to recognize same as when plugging in any new usb device very durable cables was concerned about using wireless keyboard mouse but works great with the microsoft wireless desktop including the multimedia function keys version of the switch that i received is black not white as pictured,positive
in short why a 1 star rating you wonder took forever to set up properly long wait time and poor help from tech support automatic set up i doubt will ever work for anyone though it does work once finally set up so i decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop new wireless router and a wireless print server \( ps \) so i can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house i did a lot of research and decided to get a belkin router \( f5d7231 4 \) and this ps from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set up easily together this is definitely not the case first be warned this product is not wpa compatible thus even though the router is wpa able you cannot use wpa with the ps and thus have to use wep for the network once this product is used hopefully in the future this product will support wpa but it would only hopefully do so thru a firmware upgrade do not think this ps is wpa compatible next be warned the box says 3 minute easy install well it took me about 12 hours total to get the ps working now wirelessly i am not a computer techie but i am smart a great problem solver and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages i tried to set up the ps on a static ip address as recommended by my techie friends but this just did not happen thus next time i restart the router it may assign the ps a different ip address and then i ll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set up for that new address so i plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue the crux of how i got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the mac addresses of the ps and computers in the network this is the golden key i searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router s and ps s web interfaces only this way was i able to unhook the land line from the ps to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly belkin tech support had medium wait time friendly techs \( not always speaking english without thick accents though \) and they were unable to solve my golden key for me they even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened so yes the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that i had to learn way more about this whole network configuration issue than i ever wanted or expected to and i had to manually configure the whole set up to get this product to work,negative

i purchased this to replace my 10 year old bel 846i and was really disappointed it is difficult to tell in the picture but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver on its own i wouldn t particularly like the color scheme but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield i can t believe they d think this was a good idea for some reason i was getting false laser alerts like crazy empty subdivisions on the expressway without a police car in sight parking lots at first i thought my phone might be interfering with the detector but i was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off i d expect this with a cobra detector that cost half as much but this is pretty terrible based on other reviews i don t think this is isolated to a defective unit,negative
this particular cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it it will blow you away i ve heard people complain about dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support autually their tech support sucks but i don t need them this is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully when you actually learn how to use it you won t buy anything else for the price if you are tech savey you will really enjoy the product i have nine cams installed at three locations using their ip software you can view upto 16 at once the reason i m back on this site is because i need to order two more i did have to return my first one but it was a pre production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear dlink sent my replacement direct the oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now one last comment the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50 more with less features,positive
this printer has been a piece of garbage since the day i bought it i don t know why i kept trying as the purchase was made about a year ago it should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and i would have cut my losses \( instead i did buy one more package of paper and ink mistake \) i have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge \( and i have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge i have printed about 6 \) the ironic thing is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful the one that i printed today was perfect but several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours this is the last time i try to use the printer it is finally going in the trash,negative
the transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do,negative
why do i get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by kensington people the fact is this light has some unique features that most usb lights don t including an on off switch and two brightness levels however that doesn t come close to overcoming the drawbacks first of all the price is way too high for what you are getting also the brightness difference between four and eight leds is negligible but the biggest flaw in this light by far is that the flexible arm is not nearly strong enough to support the weight of the lamp i have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor which is just plain ridiculous for the price they are getting they should have produced a more durable product,negative
does not consistently work i have a toshiba a15 \( win xp pro \) and sometimes this works but usually it doesn t lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer it used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver but lately it s just been giving me a blue screen i have used pcmcia cards before and never once had any issues d link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver bad customer service i will never buy a d link product again,negative
i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work,negative
consider another receiver before buying delorme s delorme s receiver works only with their software \( the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers \) the delorme software itself is not very accurate just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme s software sometimes is unable to find it \( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesn t seem to accomplish much \) real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages,negative
i wanted to convert an hp laserjet 4 plus to a networked printer even though instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not work the customer support is claimed to be 24 7 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet this product cost more than a linksys router so customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time,negative
our oskar multimedia storage cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition my husband assembled the unit with ease until it was time to nail the card board backing on following the instructions he laid the unit down on it s face of course the kick board had already been added so it didn t lay flat when nailing on the backing the j board \( the center shelf holding the entire unit together \) split at every point of contact we had ordered our oskar storage cabinet through amazon directly from ritz camera so naturally i called ritz to replace the j shelf i was informed i would have to return the entire unit i immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than i wanted to go through so i tracked down the number for oskar and called them directly they were very efficient and helpful within minutes i had their assurance that they would ship a new j shelf to my home at no additional charge the shelf arrived within the promised ten days this unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it s intended purpose i would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard so as not to split the center shelf my favorite feature of the oskar multimedia wood storage cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves unlike so many other brands i have an entire stack of shelves that i can add as needed i would love to have three or four more of these units,positive

i purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it the drive has a controller board error i contacted western digital for a replacement but they tell me that it is out of warranty apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it if it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from western digital with other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties i will never buy western digital again,negative
i was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies hearing is believing it gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that i simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub i had purchased for movies it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy it really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market i am not certain it can go as low as 27hz since i have not measured but i am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls i just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system i could i was able to do so with the addition of this sub i am glad i found and tried it before paying much more for another sub i was considering yet i hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250 watt sub its peak dynamic power is 250 watts but the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier therefore it is a 150 watt sub,positive

i ordered this cable a few weeks ago although i must say that it does work fine the cable looks cheap \( in fact it is very thin \) and its length is less than 6 feet as you may agree length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that so for 20 \( including shipping \) i think it was not exactly a good deal,negative

this is the perfect little tv dvd for a little girl s room the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands \( volume channel change \) my daughter age 4 loves it i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny very close together i can barely read what each button does because the labels print is also very tiny this is annoying when in my daughter s darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you can t eject or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode in other words when i go to put in a dvd i can t just push open nothing will happen you have to find the right button choose dvd from a choice of 3 4 things and only then will the tray slide open all in all these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again although it would be nice if they did come out w a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons symbols for a small child to recognize one great thing i want to point out there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards \( something not all dvd players offer \) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre movie ads you can ff right to the beginning of the movie,positive
the stick came in an excellent condition and works perfectly i recommend this product,positive
since we bought this to work with our mac we have had nothing but problems if asked to print one page of a document only it freaks out all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down have had long sessions with hp customer service on the phone and they haven t a clue if we could have been bothered we would have taken it back but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages \( at least we do recycle \) there are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash can never work out specifically what we just sigh and reset it will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon,negative
when i first got this camera i was satisfied it is complicated to use \( definitely not intuitive \) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want however it took pretty good pictures however soon after the warranty expired it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn t stop it from doing that we tried to contact fuji but have gotten no response my wife found that this is a common problem \( overeposure and lack of response from fuji \) which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell hopefully they have fixed the problem but i wouldn t bet my money on it this camera has given us more frustration than it is worth,negative

i have two ni mh chargers and sony batteries won t charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own non standard charger that probably won t again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest don t waste your money or support sony s attempt to bring non standard products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough,negative

and i was right i should have passed on this it was a pain to configure and then none of the settings would stick whenever i changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset that kind of defeats the point returning this item so i can get something decent the money saved is not worth it,negative
i have had this unit for just over a year beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out because of this design it is prone to misalign the cd which will either not load and the no disc warning will show or when it does play there is a significant vibration to try to remedy this i had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit alas i just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime it is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a sony by the way the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor,negative

i bought this headset from retailer \( offline \) and returned it the next day first off i have to make it clear that i had no problems with sound even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger \( they use 40mm drivers \) the sound quality of the headset was just fine however when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin the awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears \( and a bad seal on closed back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation \) also i have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough in fact i litterally couldn t wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red \( flush \) from discomfort mind you i also own a cheap pair of koss headphones i can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isn t good at all discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return if your ears are tough you should have no problem with this headset the sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you however if you re looking for comfort and good sound isolation you ll want to look elsewhere,negative
works as it should it s enough for my needs and handles simultaneous activity on all ports well not an unbearable dropoff in performance while say transferring huge files to an external hard drive while burning a dvd and fiddling with the ipod if you re like me and you need your laptop to do a little more without adding to desk clutter uneccesarily this should suit you fine,positive

i don t know where the guy below got that this card doesn t work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference very clean sound i use it to dj with using mixvibes using the asio drivers and it works beautifully a great buy to say the least pick one up you wont regret it,positive
this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \),negative
i bought this drive from pcuniverse on amazon and i am generally happy with the service i received and product quality i have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive the speed looks good even over wireless network i also like the truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive \( usb flash or disk drive look at it seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities i am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8gb flash business yet possibly because people don t need it i had a corsair 1gb drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well upgraded to 8gb as my data requirement grew,positive
issue solved i returned the harmony for a full refund all thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team after screwing up everything on christmas day \( it was a christmas present \) \) your support staff said level 2 would contact me within 24 hours after waiting 72 hours i called support again yesterday after waiting 30 minutes i finally got to speak with a real live agent who could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor s approval this was after providing the incident number that took another 15 minutes i then waited another 30 minutes \( total now 1 15 \) before i had to leave i tried again several hours later after being told level 2 was not available i hung up and immediately returned my harmony to thanks logitech keit,negative

i purchased this usb light fan combo mainly for the fan i m one of those guys who is a human heater always a little warmer than everyone else i use this fan when i m studying in the library on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk it provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over i can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running of course you can see right through the blades the fan runs quietly too i ve had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn t running a quickly as normal i just pop off the rotor head adjust the blades a bit \( they are flexible vinyl and i give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case \) pop the rotor head back on and it s good as new again while i like this product a lot i doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but i still think it s well worth it my only regret is that i didn t order two or three of these for future back ups if needed the light works well too it does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user \( a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but i think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well \) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document,positive
this unit satisfies in its gps functionality but is problematic elsewhere when i decided to purchase a gps i decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone \( motorola razr v3 \) the bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect unfortunately the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes even though the 6000t would still show the unit and phone as connected customer service was no help it seems their script only includes the instructions download the latest software \( i already had \) and reset the unit \( didn t help \) second problem the unit started turning itself off randomly \( actually it went into sleep mode \) while driving down the road the customer service response you are correct download the latest software \( i already had \) and reset the unit \( didn t help \) i finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair \( at my expense of course \) i received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired their solution for the unit randomly going into sleep mode they turned off the power management so the unit would not go into sleep mode under any circumstance well i suppose that is a solution but a pretty crappy one since if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle the gps battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car i expected much better at this price point shoulda gone with garmin,negative

i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming and its response time did deliver it is more precise in it s cursor control than any other mouse i ve used however it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me i find it s side buttons are difficult to use they re very small and their action is not to my liking further i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons i ve found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date,negative

consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing \( as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp \) expect these to fail within 1 2 years expect to pay approx 400 to replace the color wheel and 200 to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1 2 years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx 150 250 depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another 1 2 years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait 15 minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for 18 months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time i have a 42 samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every 2 years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap,negative

the good we plugged in our new lns2651d on 3 7 7 about an hour northwest of tampa bay right out of the box with an old rabbit ear antenna we received five hd broadcasts the picture is amazing in both color and clarity the bad we reset the sound coming directly from its speakers but because of speaker location underneath below the screen it lacks sparkle esp at low to med volume the ugly imagine sending your intelligent pretty young daughter out on her first date with shoveled on make up and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress the piano black case on this tv is a nightmare it shows a rippled effect which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines \( even lightly \) on it i m hoping after the r d department who designed the case is sent to siberia they redeem themselves by designing a matte finish slip cover for this otherwise excellent tv,positive

besides the fact that ipod is a skinny little waste of time let s also mock the fact that it plays about two formats whatever mac plays and mp3 woohoo what a selection then we have the iaudio it has perhaps a half inch thickness at most over the ipod for the standard battery model \( 20gb and 30gb anyway 60gb is as thick as an xl \) though it includes so much more bang for your buck even if some of that bang is kind of useless but come on an fm radio isn t ipod standard almost every other portable hd player has that by now about the only thing ipod has over iaudio is movie quality which is admittedly better but i m fairly basic i m buying it for my music not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen if i want to do that i ll buy a portable dvd player for pictures unless they re ridiculously high quality this suits just fine but it s not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players it s the sound quality which is marvelous it consistantly beats ipod it has bbe equalizer and it not plays mp3 and aac but wma wav ooc and flac flac and if you download rockbox \( which is something you ll have to research on your own kids \) you can create themes boost your battery life and augment your listening pleasure even further the only drawbacks are the battery life if you don t use playlists skip around a lot or play high bitrate files \( all of which are fixed rather well by rockbox \) and the subpack what is a subpack it s a fairly good idea done badly it s a piece of plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player in it are the power jack line out \( which has a bad bass roll off problem unfortunately \) and line in jack and usb port the general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else but it wasn t executed too well buying a charger from com solves the power jack and usb port problems nicely and is recommended most highly \( and did i mention recording with the built in mic is amazing you can get good quality concerts with this puppy \) plus it s black ipod comes standard white and the x5 is just better,positive

the write up sounds good with many options and features but after closer examination i had to take it back first thing it appears that the front dv plug was an after thought for panasonic it s a rinky dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main av s plugs are located this is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit retro fitting it in wherever the tiny button within a button toggle switch for fastforward reverse etc looks like it s glued on it won t last long with normal use and it s hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit the menu interface is difficult to navigate the remote control is horrible a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features you might want to pass on this one remember the saying if it sounds too good to be true it probabily is,negative

i was tempted by the low price of this item the only reviewer before me gave it a 5 star rating although aware of the unreliability of a single review i decided to gave it a shot and paid 10 for shipping no other way since it s sold through a third party 28 later i was holding the biggest i ve seen in a while the construction feels very cheap and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3 year old and the worst of all only one of the two microphones worked even the one that works is horrible the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic it uses a 9 volt battery in each of the two mics and that s another 5 bucks out of my pocket you know what i ll probably have to eat the 33 since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns well i learned a lesson things are cheap for a reason,negative

the product was shipped to me in moscow after the first charge i took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours upon returning home and recharging the device i discover that it will not turn on anymore i suspect the battery is charging as the led indicates this as it is connected to ac power however disconnecting it from any power source it appears that the ac outlet and usb ports no longer function the device gives no auditory signal or led message so i don t know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it either way i m left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 watt solar panel anyway i strongly suggest getting the battery from tekkeon sorry about the bad review but i had my hopes for this device as well,negative

i recently purchased the pacific breeze laptop cooler and so far am very impressed with it now this review should be taken with a grain of salt because i have only had the cooler for a few weeks but i feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate the reason that i was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps i installed notebook hardware control \( free temperature and power control utility \) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55c at my hard drive worried about how this would affect the hard drive s longevity i started looking around at coolers i choose this cooler after reviewing several of the mat variety but chose this one because of its design as the previous reviewers have already mentioned this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook this allows the cpu fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air after setting this cooler up i was feeling pretty good about the purchase qualitatively the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook quantitatively the notebook experienced a 5c temperature drop at my hd and at my cpu now my hard drive is running at 40c 45c instead of 45 50c i would definitely recommend this product,positive

usually i discount negative reviews i think people may have sour grapes against a company or not understand how to install or work something i somewhat tech savvy i installed our wireless network that took a little doing i work as a technical recruiter so technology doesn t intimidate me i like technology so i had been nudging my husband for a print server so that i could print without going to the printer and plugging in he came home with this belkin product and went about installing it usually i like to research before i purchase a product but he wanted to handle this so he installed it and i went back and checked his work and he had followed the instructions exactly i know he had some trouble and had called tech support at my suggestion i would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support the only problem is that the printserver doesn t work so i tried installing the software on my pc and trying to problem solve from there i called the tech support hotline back and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time i waited for 2 hours then went out to run some errands there was still no message from a technician when i returned this morning my husband needed to get some work done from home he created a document and knowing that the print server did not work he wired up to the printer to print that way but now the printer won t respond to the signal so he can t print that way either so we deleted the belkin software and rebooted the computer he still can t print so i went back to my pc and tried to delete the software through the control panel it won t delete i am getting an error message i can t print either so now i am on hold with belkin customer assistance maybe it s a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is i swear i hear a little indian accent that doesn t mean that customer support has been outsourced to india and even if it is that doesn t mean customer support is bad but my experience with this is that while i can get a real live person on the phone he can t do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back when i tried to get my problem escalated i overwhelmed him and he put me on hold i am still on hold i have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight i called back from my cell phone and someone who sounded so much like the first operator i spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician and someone would call back in 1 2 hours when i strongly protested asked for his name asked for a number i could call directly he offered to transfer me immediately and now i have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone i am starting to sense a trend here my husband boiling over his inability to print an important document has gone off to work to print it there i am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call i usually discount negative reviews but this is really my experience with this product and if you are considering purchasing it i would encourage you to think that through a little further,negative

totally agree with the other reviewers comments originally i was going to buy canon s adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic plus even with shipping this is still cheaper \( by 5 bucks \) and its metal fyi if you don t have any filters \( like i didn t \) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm \( circular polarizer uv protector and 812 warming len \) a good buy for the price i bought it because of the reviewers comments and don t regret it,positive

works fine on windows xp but does not work well with linux i ve been using linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under linux my built in 10 100 nic was much faster than this card would go ended up getting an intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a linux box,negative

do not buy this if you own the c340 it doesn t fit and amazon shouldn t market this as if it will it s a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise you ll be in for a lot of wasted time and money the garmin is great but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem,negative
this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter if you order this item number you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia 2 1 slot on a pc or mac it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card there is nothing compact flash about it the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon s website,negative
i received my package within three days via the super saver shipping \( cost me nothing \) the printer is great too i used the brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to hp and i m impressed the printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up and its very light weight and small size making it more portable i love it,positive
the quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag it also has a small bag for the ac power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15 laptop,positive
this little scanner is not worth the price it s got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use there is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency large gaps in between the frequency ranges it s programmed to receive and very limited memory capabilities the small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device looking from any angle and the backlit lcd display is unreadable reception of this scanner is poor on all of it s \( very limited \) bands though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna the scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources the squelch is practically useless on this thing it s either on or off it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it s set just above the static level on any empty frequency the sound quality from the built in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding but at least there is a jack for an external speaker on the bright side the chassis is well built and strong the buttons have a decent feel not to light nor too stiff the knobs turn with ease but will not change their settings due to road vibration they stay put where you set them at the fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall but it s not enough to make up for it s lacking feature set and poor performance,negative
great product but is only 30 at iriver com s stor,positive
i was looking for a small cheap mp3 player and i didn t care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me i saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so i decided to buy it when i got the creative nano i was really happy with its preformance until i tried to put my subscription music onto it thats when i learned that it wouldn t hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money after that i started realising all of its imperfections you can t use the fm radio in the car without hearing mostly static you can t search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to don t get me wrong there are some good sides to this mp3 player but i still would definately not recommend it,negative
the unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card this requires determining the cf card id when registering instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating magellan s web site is tricky at best if you enter the cf id incorrectly you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the cf card beware,negative
when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off overall a nice case shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping received in about one week,positive

installation express install is over 200mb full install about 650mb it requires you to upgrade to internet explorer 6 to continue installation \( how it this related to printer installation and what if i don t use internet explorer i do not \) install takes forever is memory hog then tries to sign you up for some services i used to like hp printers i m completely disappointed with the software to the point that i would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software,negative
this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you d hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod wouldn t stress the electronics i d give this thing 5 stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good,negative
i have to rate this product and this company as horrible i purchased the x2 in 12 2004 everything was fine in 6 2005 the lamp blew less than 300 hours on it i called the company they said sometimes it happens i questioned the projector they said i just needed a new lamp 300 00 later oh you can only get the lamps from them you can only get service on the x2 from them i get the new lamp it just blew again about 700 hours half of what the life should be additionally the fan died which may be why the lamp blew maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago \( when it was still under warranty but they wouldn t look at it \) no they say no the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place the projector was blown clean on a regular basis this projector was not mistreated or misused infocus says sometimes this happens they for 250 plus 30 00 shipping will fix the fan i also need to buy a new lamp another 300 the company keeps saying it is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc etc etc they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product i will get a new projector i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one my new projector will not will never be an infocus product they have failed to stand behind their product their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties don t buy infocus,negative
this product has good and bad points i listed some below good cheaper than apple \( 5 as compared to 30 \) works great small convienient bad cheap \( might not hold up long term \) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wrong has to be plugged in upside down \( for me anyway \) overall i m glad i bought this instead of apple s version the main factor for me was price but if you have the money get the apple charger simply because you ll be covered by warranty that way,positive
i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it but that s really a personal problem,positive

the keyboard protector fits very well on my macbook but in the end i got tired of how much slower my typing was when i used the protector it claims it doesn t slow down your typing speed at all but it really does you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so as i m typing this review now i m not using my protector anymore if you don t mind how it slows down your typing then go ahead and get it,negative
these are some of the worst ear buds i have heard since the very first ones came out voices are muted highs are muddy and lows are non existant the only redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surround sound \( yeah right \) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers,negative

i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer \( hp deskjet 712c \) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others reviews i tried it anyway because the price was right it may look a little cheesy but it works i didn t even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it very good product,positive
i would love to try this first one was shipped broken \( make a clanking noise and woulnd t work \) sent it back and got a new one that didn t read a dvd i may try one more time its pretty heavy but i am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i pod type machines,negative

before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader,negative
it pairs quickly with laptops bluetooth phones holds the gps module firmly and matches the look perfectly the only gripe i have is it doesn t have an anti slip surface so that i can throw it on the dashboard and not worry about it falling off the battery lasts forever i remember using it for 6 continous hors before switching off mind you switching off because i had arrived at my destination,positive
they clean the screen so to speak but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off it doesn t really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on but i still don t like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment the monitor would have been cleaner overall had i just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw since it doesn t affect picture during use but regardless i am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent i thought these would be a solution but they ve turned out to be just another problem i have to figure out,negative

i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough,negative
this is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned what makes it the best 1 16 million color 2 5 lcd touchscreen 2 battery life is too good to be true 52 hours audio 10hr video 3 the best sound it has how much tweaks its sick you can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks has bbe wide stereo enhancement stereo etc 4 the volume is sooo dam loud i had a zune and the volume level was at 20 the lourdest it could go the d2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune 5 you can encode avi video bitrate at 1 5mbps also have wmv which you can encode at 768kbps 6 no need to install to transfer files it works like a usb flash drive 7 you can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own 8 the touchscreen is smooth and flawless when playing music it tells you the info of the file example bitrate info hz etc something that is lacking on the big boys 9 has tv output also has a recorder to record conversations 10 can view txt files 11 can view pics at very high pixels 12 fm tuner you can record from the fm radio you can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps 13 has a sd slot for more storage get a 8 gig sd for a total for 12 gig imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig sd 14 great support firmware updates are always available plus sooo much more,positive

i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory although 15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds the 100 shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it s category,positive
the software is terrible slow and glitchy i have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player the operators manual is just under 100 pages so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls granted the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual,negative

the cables to go 4 port usb ps unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device the video card goes into some blacked out video mode the pc has to be shutdown the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc you must bo the port and watch the reboot then card is ok until next reboot unattended frustrating the keyboard and mouse are ok but with wireless keyboard mouse combo the box can not be on auto scan mode too many drawbacks,negative
the design for this headset is ingenious every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience it s not really a headset but a headphone with a detachable headset so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player the microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base the extension cord comes with a volume controller another very convenient feature there are also little hangers on the extension cord which are for attaching the microphone cord the audio quality is pretty good throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality the only thing i have to complain about is the comfort issue maybe it s the size of my head but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage other than that this headset is perfect,positive

functions absolutely flawlessly under vista 64bit \( unlike most other cards such as my older wintv pvr 150 \) if not for the next paragraph i d give it five stars for just this heck it does better under vista x64 than my old card did under winxp 32 \( disclaimer i tested the analog video only not the digital \) but i discovered that it was running extrememly hot even when just sitting their idle so hot that you literally can t even touch it ouch i ended up removing it from the case as i didn t trust it perhaps it s a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it s not in use emailed tech support but they offered no real answer other than it shouldn t be warm at all,negative

great features with the microsoft mouse wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier comes with a usb dongle that i did not want to use so i was determined to get this mouse working with the built in bluetooth in my new dell latitude notebook found that the toshiba drivers provided by dell for the bluetooth would not work with the microsoft mouse seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of bluetooth devices go figure had to delete the toshiba drivers and let xp with sp 2 provide the drivers and it works great pros great features no cord long battery life between charges \( days \) very responsive cons some difficulty getting it to work without supplied dongle bigger than i like to pack around for a notebook,positive
i bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk and for that purpose it s an admirable phone plus the contrast adjustable lcd displays current date and time without you having to set it the buttons for call list browsing option setting etc are on the back of the receiver so you don t have to take the phone off the hook to use them the sound quality is great of course this being a corded phone and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand the keypad lights up although only for a few seconds dial fast in the dark the ring tone is nice at its medium setting minus i find the base a bit bulky the lcd has no background light and when the handset is set to hi volume you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base \( i keep the setting at lo though which is plenty loud \) my main gripe is that the phone doesn t have a voicemail indicator which would be extremely sweet with my phone company \( vonage \) also the caller id stuff works with batteries only at least they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone still four stars because the phone does all it says it does,positive
very solid nice looking shelf easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included it s exactly as i expected it,positive
it s a usb hub all i ask is that it works it does,positive
i did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the serial port on a computer since most new computers use usb for serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited my two newly purchased hp computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product i would not have bought it had i known this i have not used the gps since i bought it it will probably be tossed out the serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package so you don t see it prior to opening the package once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs i have seen the plastic clamshell is so hard to open that i think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors the cut plastic is also dangerous,negative

for 99 this should be a much better remote if you watch movies in the dark you have to use the glow button guess what you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least also logitech has over simplifed the remote you can t program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly if you have to go into the device menu a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume why not have an option to program each button period but the remote is useless now because of the low battery life do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month ridiculous only remote i have ever had like this,negative
i would give a high recommendation for this tv it is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you re not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie the morning or evening news or the late shows in high def dvd player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the tv at all the picture is outstanding and isn t that what really matters in the end the only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation the tv has an auto on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the tv once it goes on it you are use the hdmi as i am to get signal from your cable box you must have the tv input mode set to hdmi but you can t set the auto on to the hdmi input \( it must be a channel number \) the engineers just didn t think that one through all the way oh well still a great tv,positive

i bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive i was using crashed and took my backup with it the maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes the initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too so far so good the problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn t backup new or updated files the scheduled backup doesn t work at all the light flashes so you think it s working but it doesn t backup any new or updated files the synch is useless too it s like the backup function it will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn t synch any of your new or updated files like it s supposed to it s like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that s it to get around the fact that it won t automatically back up my files i have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as i have to remember what files have been updated and or are new i would not buy this product again it s not an automatic backup drive it s just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn t reliable at all if you need a backup drive look elsewhere sorry to say this one is a complete waste of money,negative
i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr i then saw the pricetag and unlike the other people i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr it is definitely not worth it for something i get for 8 extra a month attached to my cable service yes i do love the tivo interface and searching but i will not pay that much for it it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price knock 700 dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind,negative

i have an ipaq pda and i own a tomtom gps both of which work well this combo ipaq tomtom is in the rough and needs to undergo some re tooling i m surprised that other reviewers mention what i deem significant flaws and then go on to rate the unit as a 4 or 5 star for example the travel companion stalls and needs soft resets for a right handed person the stylus is awkward support is not good moving through programs can be painfully slow the gps tracking lags i depend on my gps and pda for business travel buy the rx5915 if you like to play with gadgets as it s loaded with some fun stuff but not if you need something dependable while on the road,negative
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again,positive
pros perfect sound solved resampling issues cons famous popping crackling noises makes it useless for gaming especially in bf2 \( which use openal by creative \) crystallizer is useless this card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 of high end systems not only nvidia nforce 4 chipset but also with other amd and intel cpu motherboards see google for x fi popping crackling even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chance to get it after any memory or hd upgrade or driver configuration change for long time creative denied existence of this problem eventually it was recognized \( see official cl forums \) and a new driver \( since november 2005 \) was promised at the end of may 2006 but beta version published 05 30 06 did not solve my problem in the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial hacked drivers i suspect that x fi crackling is an architecture design flow which cannot be completely solved at software level because pci bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card hd controller and other devices bottom end i have to stop playing games or go back to low quality integrated sound do not take risk wait for working drivers or buy a working card from different manufacturer with fixed drivers i would give this card 4 or 5 stars update 06 12 2006 i found that many desktop motherboards \( mb \) have really slow south bridge \( south bridge is connecting pci usb firewire and hd to cpu directly or through north bridge \) especially mbs with nvidia chipsets \( and even with some intel mbs \) new beta x fi driver and mb bios updates solved the problem in many cases \( but not for my mb asrock k8nf4g sata2 nvidia 6100 410 mcp chipset \) but situation is still marginal and x fi might go unstable again i contact cl customer service they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ati chipsets \( athlon 64 ati 200 or 3200 \) have no problems with x fi i decided not to return sb to seller but save it for a new computer with ati based mb i guess that majority of workstation class mbs with upscale south bridge and pci x \( even nvidia based \) also should be fine with x fi the trouble is that majority of x fi buyers have generic nvidia based mbs like me so i can give x fi two stars instead of 1 \( but i cannot change the rating \) and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release \( if it will work \),negative

awesome concept however i live in an apartment that doesn t have any south facing windows so i was unable to get a signal i strongly advise against calling the xm radio help from a phone that won t use up your cell phone minutes had to call them four different times and all they did was read me the instruction manual and tell me that if i don t have signal my radio won t work \( i had clearly established that fact already \) i recieved the radio for free because of a rebate and didn t even intend on getting xm radio but figured since the unit was free and an mp3 player to give it a try i was going to break down and buy the 70 car kit but then i ran across the agt sportscaster for 20 which came with a car kit since i can t use it in my house i hook up the home base to the car kit and at least i can use it that way this ended up being a lot of work for something i wasn t sure i wanted in the first place haven t used the mp3 player yet but napster does not seem the most user friendly \( i have the majority of my songs on itunes,negative
besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned belkin support is horrible the automated system consistenly disconnects the call requiring going through their operator my 4 port kvm stopped functioning after six months there s no information on the web to help either it s as if there is no way to fix a kvm that doesn t work flash upgrading is a joke i followed the procedure directly from belkin s website so i had to rma replace it trust me belkin doesn t care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall go with iogear they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin s without cables,negative
i loved this printer the print quality is truly phenomenal i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months exactly one month after the 1 yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp won t do anything for me after speaking to 8 people on the phone \( only one of which i understood fully \) and 3 supervisors they just said that i m sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts,negative
in theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive however i purchased three of these \( 2 for me 1 for a friend \) i can t say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness \( \) all in all a disappointment,negative

this is an awesome little device let me start with the pros 1 \) easy incredibly easy setup \( literally press one button never believed it but it s true plug in the usb transmitter press the blue button voila \) 2 \) good sound for a small set of speakers these things sound great they are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system but sound very good and comparable to a 45 two speaker set of monitor side speakers there s a built in sub woofer that helps as well 3 \) wireless range with 4 aa batteries you can carry this little guy around your whole house and outside your house reception is great i am used to bluetooth headsets that don t really work much further than 10 feet from the phone i had doubts about bluetooth speakers but i am amazed with reception these guys have 4 \) controls the forward reverse pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both media player or yahoo music engine running on the laptop \( the only two i tried \) again i was surprised but they worked flawlessly 5 \) cool as far as cool factor this little guy is definitely that cons 1 \) no remote it would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound ff rw pause play controls 2 \) no control from pc you can t control the sound \( or mute \) from the laptop only from the speakers 3 \) sound above i said the sound was good and it is considering the size of this system however these are small speakers and a mini sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too it s good but it s not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system there is base but not a great deal you definitely won t feel the music with these speakers 4 \) volume volume is limited it s enough to fill a mid sized room but not much more for 100 this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with no wires carry it to your kid s room to the garage to the basement no wires nothing if convenience is and portability is important to you and if medium sound quality is ok then i would highly recommend this speaker system it s great personally i m not sure if i m going to keep them because i would really like fuller sound \( this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room \) and more base but they re so cool and convenient that i doubt i ll be able to give them up for other bluetooth ideas and wi fi network options see my post at the hydrogen audio forum,positive

the six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product i purchased this to use as an interface between a cd walkman player and the ac power cord the heads have specific polarity so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly however if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated it s not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time i found the product to work effectively the only negative i can see is that the actual plug in device is a bit bulky so if you want to use this in a power strip setting the ah3wh can be a bit of a plug hog however other than that limitation the product was reliable recommended to save on those batteries which do add up,positive

if you want a budget home theater system for under 200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony ht ddw700 this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room considering the price sound quality is actually better then expected for me the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren t and are a bit heavier then they look the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin they are fixed and can t be replaced also if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you the 8 subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under 200 it isn t powered is very light \( only 9 lbs \) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs it should be enough in most cases an extra digtal input or two wouldn t hurt but again the system is under 200 setup couldn t be easier you just hook up the included microphone place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance delay and volume levels the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don t really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all basically if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under 200 then there isn t much better then the sony ht ddw70,positive
i was ready to take this player back to the store i checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to how to videos this was the best thing i could have found the videos walk through all the settings you need to configure on your pc to get the player to work for drag and drop showing album art i had no idea my pc was set not to show hidden folders who would hide folders anyway nonetheless i now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer like others have said the photo option is not that great so don t buy it for that i mostly want it for working out so pics don t make much of a difference to me dh has a 30g ipod so if i wanna see graphics i can just borrow that lol i have over 250 mp3 formatted songs on the player \( and it s full \) and will likely get a micro sd card so i can expand it a little bit all in all i do like this little player,positive

our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office after we set them up it works just fine we didn t use any of the advanced features at that time after reading the user s guide and online forum at the linksys web site we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is not user replaceable you need to send it in for replacement sure enough we now have two routers that can t retain any configuration settings they all reset to factary default all of a sudden one after 1 year the other after 1 and half year also note we updated one of the router to newest firmware which prevents any kind of connection from the internet needless to say my boss is really crossed with me because i was the one recommend the model,negative

you will appreciate this product only if you don t have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price,positive
i had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my xm radio and this was recommended to me through a friend it s super easy to install and works great it doesn t move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups it was well worth the money and in the summer heat i am glad i bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back,positive

as the ps2 does not have hdmi outputs for high definition tv s the monster cable gamelink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more you d have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard \( red white yellow \) av cables picture clarity they are in two different worlds and monster fully delivers however your tv must have component \( red blue green \) inputs for this cable to be useful ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your ps2 to your compatible tv receiver these cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable therefore you ll have to forget using the single plug in the ps2 offers for both audio and video however your sound will be uncompressed fully digital audio this is definitely a plus rather than a negative any mid priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input,positive

let me start off by saying like some others out there theses seemed like a dream come true got my first pair \( yes i said first \) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard they sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected i was saving in the meantime for the ac 1 soundcard that goes w the head phones one day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead double check with oter pc s and verify bad headset ok no problem amazon was great with the exchange got my 2nd pair in a week i decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up got the card for my b day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a irq conflict i believe o well just bad luck i guess sent it back again amazon very good about it soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have eax or x fi which alot of games use today i got an email saying that amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well so there you have it razer seems to have issues with it s production thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing amazon was great and i m happy they didn t just ship me another pos,negative
ok so this is probably not the best protection for your ipod but what do you want for 6 bucks i m cheap if you re not buy something more expensive perhaps pros it does protect the screen and click wheel nicely the flip up top magnetically shuts and holds securely which i guess helps if you happen to drop it cons the belt clip is ridiculous it s not a stationary clip instead it spins around which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater this product is not for the joggers the leather strap that comes with it is too short which makes it difficult to operate the ipod when it s around your neck it seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under pros above but as long as you never take your ipod out of the case no worries this is made for the 30 gb ipod video but it s actually a little big for it it leaves room for the ipod to slide up and down in the case it makes accessing the hold switch difficult sometimes when the flip up top is down it s easier to just open the top if you don t care about the cons and you are cheap like me go ahead and buy it,negative
sure these floppy s are inexpensive they arrived on time thanks amazon but the photo doesn t give it any credit these don t come with a plastic carrying case like the photo just a crappy cardboard box come on guys wheres the plastic case for these things now they will be flopping all over the place in my desk drawers etc,negative
i bought this because i wanted an encrypted device that i could use to offload personal documents i receive while traveling for work and then read them using my mac \( s \) at home lexar jd ii is the only product i found advertised to work with both macs and pcs at the same time my primary mac is an intel mac early on i realized the encryption utility only runs on ppc macs okay so i figured i d use it on the ppc mac mini and everything seeemed fine at first then i hit a problem where my mac mini could not read video dvds a little search on the mac support forums and i found that installing lexar jd software disables video dvd support on my mac fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall aside from the problems with the macs i also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned which is that you must be logged in as a local administrator to use the encryption software under windows since my work pc is a member of a domain i had to create a local account log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway kingston data traveler elite works fine under windows domain logins unfortunately for me they don t have mac software yet so in summary the current lexar encryption software can t be used on a windows domain machine can t be used on an intel mac breaks the dvd on a ppc mac it s not for me however if you are using the lexar strictly on stand alone windows pcs or you don t require encryption it should be okay,negative

i have no axe to grind with bose i originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up this speaker has an incredibly small footprint if space is limited this is not a bad option however being honest this is not a great center channel speaker choosing speakers is like the addage certain horses for certain courses your budget your room your components all play a part i have two home theater setups one is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from polk audio the other is a dedicated theater utilizing definitive technologies with b k reference 7 1 processing clearly the bose vcs 10 can not hold its own with my larger setup however i have run it with my polk audio s and it was workable the timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my polk csi3 but it was not awful my bottom line you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker can you buy a better one in this price range i think so if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system you should always buy the best components within your budget but remember you are building a system it s not just about one speaker if this speaker fits your space and \( more importantly \) matches your other speakers then it may be the right speaker for you,negative

i bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17 laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is the storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag i also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to as an engineer i must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop,positive
i gave a detailed review of the base system but the handset merits comments separately i have purchased handsets for every room in the house and because i don t like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere i use them they re easily customizable through the pc interface although they can be customized without it as well each handset gets its out name so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple \( no more trying to remember which room has the fifth handset \) i ve been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset i ve read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality but i ve had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios if you re shopping for one of these then you ve already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it so you know the quality to expect i think the uniden clx485 is the best residential phone system i ve ever experienced the handset lives up to that standard too,positive

i bought this card and the belkin pre n wireless router in nov 2006 at a bestbuy store during thanksgiving sale the router worked but the card did not i called belkin many times everytime they asked me to re install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked i wasted more than 4 hours on phone and re installing drivers again and again then finally belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement i pointed out that i should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs i have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive,negative

we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didn t have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center boxed it up and it s going right back where it came from if it s okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what s the use in having an alarm clock if you can t trust that it will indeed wake you up,negative
i have purchased the card for my 3 years old toshiba laptop which has a wireless card \( b \) so i thought it is time to go faster i have connected to various access points with it but for the first week i could not get it to connect to internet so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all after installing the latest driver i connected to internet however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop s card it is very very slow plus it did not see some of the networks which i could see with my laptop s card the tech guys have been very kind but their advice did not help i am very disappointed,negative
i have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything i hoped for when i first opened the box it was shipped in i was very put off there was a very very strong chemical smell i chalked it up to something in the packaging material it turns out that was not where the smell was coming from it was the mouse pad itself having worked in a shoe factory years ago i was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue the smell hung around for a couple of days now 1 week after having received my purchase if i put my nose close to the pad it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue i would caution those with allergies and or asthma to consider this prior to purchase as an asthmatic i can say it did affect my breathing some what that seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened i have finished with my public health warning on to the mouse pad it is simply the best mouse pad i have ever used i have had wrist problems for over 4 years now i have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work in the past week my swelling has greatly reduced my pain is almost gone my wrist sits perfectly on the wrist rest the pad actually cradles my wrist the wrist rest moves with my hand so well and with so much support it seems to be an extension of my body a new improved appendage i have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk it truly is that comfortable i already have plans to purchase two more for friends as christmas gifts worth every cent go for it you will not be disappointed,positive
i purchased this item on 6 3 06 from amazon and a 250gb ata ide hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor it all went together fine and i could mount the volume easily enough the first thing i noticed is that it s wi fi wouldn t work with wep with my powerbook it d work without encryption on the airport extreme but not with wep or with wpa i noted that and used it without the wi fi for a few days i noted it wouldn t hold time at all consistently it wouldn t register a network time server s data and was always in the wrong time zone so i had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time but it would still drift about ten minutes per day and then jump an hour or two randomly making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy i found it slow to mount and it would sometimes unmount over working wep wi fi or hardwired gigabit connections which was disheartening i then decided to call tech support which is when things went from bad to worse calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff the tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around which too up to another thirty minutes folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e mails after 12 hours with customer support over two weeks and a not yet released firmware update it would work with wpa psk or open but still no wep they couldn t fix the time drift issue i repeatedly asked for a replacement but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time or another firmware update they just wouldn t spare me the trouble and replace the unit until i was ready to scream by this time i was out of amazon s return policy timeframe they refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts i even sent a letter telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or i d post my experience here on amazon of course i got a replacement unit with no other reply now i ve got to get rid of the thing onebay or whatever take the loss and move on i would never buy another d link product i would avoid this thing like anthrax weaponized anthrax i bought an iomega nas unit which works very well has multiple drives and raid and though it costs more provides decent value and it works d link has a lot to learn about customer service and should not release beta untested products to the consumer market shame on them,negative
we bought this phone two years ago while the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features \( i ve especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets \) we ve found it to be extremely unreliable the problems we ve had are listed below very short battery life for the handsets the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base \( even though we have the base in the middle of our house the handsets don t work at the ends and our house is not that big \) the handsets randomly become unregistered from the base and have to be reset \( this has only become a problem in the past month \) the issues we ve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually we d expect such a purchase to last longer than two years,negative

i just bought my first laptop computer and really really hated the touchpad i found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain i spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number i am very happy that i did too its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile definately well made im about 5 11 and have fairly big hands i find this mouse comfortable to use it looks pretty cool too the red panels on the side light up which is always good for night work all the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month i couldnt ask for better all round performance and for 20 you really cant go wrong it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse the only reason i dont give it five stars well this is technology although it is a awesome piece of kit there are always other things or features they could have added,positive
i was given the ique m3 for christmas of 2005 a few months into the new year i dropped it onto pavement and it broke for 99 garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which i consider a fair price unfortunately the refurb unit couldn t play directions at full volume so i returned it for another refurb this unit fell off the windshield still in it s cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits i called garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit they d look at it under warranty i had told the guy what happened so i was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications \( or words to that effect \) even though clearly not i have no idea why units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have for some the mapping software on the m3 will appear crippled it is a basic drive from here to there unit it does not allow you to load way points points of interest and the like each of the units had quirks on the first one every time i inserted the sd card with maps windows player \( or whatever it s called \) would start up and ask me if i wanted to search the card for tunes the second one had inaudible volume the fourth one has a problem common to the first one the brightness resets itself randomly to zero yep zero the first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero so you may think the unit is not turning on but it s on you just can t see anything on the screen if you re outside you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if it s dark you need a flashlight the current one will do a hard reset if i start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when i put it in the cradle this means i have to do the full new user routine touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone after i ve gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where i m going but i can t load destinations from contacts as they re gone so i have to type them all in by hand if the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead it forgets everything and i have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone i complained about this to support at garmin and i was assured this is a microsoft feature and that garmin can do nothing about it they recommended that i buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an sd card where it will not be lost so now i carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data i did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you can t retrieve your data from the backup sd card unless you have told the program to save as self extracting archives i learned it the hard way of course to restore i pop out the detailed maps sd card insert the backup card navigate to the file explorer navigate to the sd card open the contents of the sd card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to ok that it has finished \( just a minute or two with my small amount of data \) click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then i m good to go i can t do it while i m driving of course so if the unit resets on its own i just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where home is which means i have to type it or other locations into the where to dialogue the unit defaults to 3d directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as i can t look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where i am vis a vis the map i m sure this is my shortcoming and i then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which i can t do while driving it also defaults to different displays for day and night the night display uses a dark background and i have found that the menus for the windows programs use a transparent background with black text so i can t read the menu selections against the dark display and the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if i lose power or the unit resets when i start the car or sometimes when i put it in the cradle on the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas it also formats all numbers as us numbers i have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the \( xxx \) xxx xxxx format even though they are longer and don t start with an area code in the calendar if i have meetings scheduled outside my time zone i enter them at the time they re scheduled then when i get there i have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone so i never use the visited time zone feature and the unit assumes i m still in my home zone wherever i may travel i have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which i have the lat long coordinates i camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads i quickly lose where i am and have to zoom out which loses the road on the whole the directions part of the m3 is excellent it gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations on the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper after a year of use i can t put up with it anymore i ll take garmin s word that this is all a shortcoming of windows mobile and not garmin s fault but i can t put up with it anymore i ll switch to magellan or tomtom or some other unit that isn t windows based and that doesn t completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesn t randomly do a hard reset doesn t randomly set the brightness to zero and doesn t assume all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas maybe another manufacturer will let me import pois and way points from other people s files,negative
i travel a lot especially to europe and hate taking lots of cables with me for the vonage router laptop cellphone and crackberry the ijuice unit looked like a good idea however the unit just failed during my trip leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back up bad idea a friend switched me on to charging everything via usb i just bought a cheap 5 00 usb charger for the nokia the crackberry charges via usb anyway so i just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110 240v adaptor and i was all set laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time single point of failure is the laptop however apple does a great universal adaptor \( you can get uk us etc plugs \) with usb for charging ipods for 20 all in one neat unit you can just stick the usb for the nokia in the back seriously don t waste your money unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can t charge via usb using usb is far lighter far more reliable you don t loose the tips,negative
this is a cheap cable in both cost and quality when connected between my voodoo3 3000 card and my mag innovision dx17f monitor the picture quality was poor with severe ghosting of the screen this cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do i assume the lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality,negative

i ve been using this remote since it was released better than any others i ve run into but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too be prepared to give up a couple of hours when it s working it s a 5 star device however read on as to why i give it a 2 as i type this my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support 3rd call today i simply got a new pvr programmed ok but it isn t the default device when i watch tv also it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr it s a satellite as a pvr it couldn t be added to activities because you don t have a device that will change channels news to me never known a pvr that couldn t change channels literally 4 friggin hours so far and it still not right at some point the tv suddenly stopped turning on 2 3 hours on that issue and it s still not right tv does not go on until i hit the help button on the remote to add insult to injury i can t access the website enter my email as an id and am told it s already in the database i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized i hate that the software doesn t have a simple home button you have to go through several menus to get back to it hold time now up to 52 minutes i have to hang up for an appt so the hold has to be repeated again oh yeah i also dislike the size of the buttons especially the numbers cell phone sized no doubt designed for a dainty child i could go on but if another comes out with a product like this one i ll be looking hard at it,negative
i bought this mouse while on the road when i forgot my microsoft wireless mouse i do not have the original packaging otherwise i would have taken in back the usb receiver is hard to get out of its cradle in the back i often have to pry it out with a coin or a credit card after a week of use the mouse started to wig out erratic movement etc if the mouse is left unattended for any length of time i cannot seem to wake it up with any of the buttons the only thing that works is using the wheel to scroll the really bad part is that it seems to behave this way until i unplug the receiver i thought this was because i was using a mac i experienced the same behavior on my pc as well i m going to throw this away since i would not wish it on my enemy,negative
i have owned the dmr es40v for over 6 months it is a combo dvd vcr unit i have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit the manual it is imperative to have the manual this machine is somewhat complicated and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary if everything is working correctly you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it it is overly time consuming though since the items don t seem to logically flow if you dig long and hard enough though they are in there somewhere the set up being somewhat experienced at setting up a home theater this was generally easy the text and pictures were sufficient searching through the function menu i learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons this is needlessly confusing of course the auto clock set function isn t very accurate \( i haven t seen an accurate one yet \) dvd playback the general playback is pretty straight forward i really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my jvc progressive player \( which is 3 years older \) finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult a zoom feature is missing many convenience features are not present dvd recording recording onto a dvd ram disc is a dream compared to old fashioned vcr tapes i really enjoy using them a quirk you must have the unit in stand by to record from the scheduler this mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another \( on the same disc \) you must wait until the unit begins recording then select the show to watch from the navigator the uhf tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19 other weak channels record but not 19 this problem started about 6 months after initial set up there is an annoying bug with daylight savings time and the newer extended time period the panasonic web site suggests going into the set up menu and unchecking the dst box thus removing the feature if this did anything it would allow you to set the clock manually being without the automatic dst adjustment would not be annoying but even though you turn off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm est this ruins any tv scheduling you had set this malady persisted until the date of the former dst spring ahead arrived several weeks of scheduling hell i requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised no message no number to call just a promise to call again when i was home the vcr use this feature is really buggy you are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote but this only worked for a month or two when a tv show is scheduled for recording the unit won t tape it if you merely insert a cassette it doesn t recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move either playing a little or fast forwarding reversing this is really annoying last impression the last movie \( last king of scotland \) i watched took over the machine the remote control would not function the disc would not stop and the disc could not be ejected it was necessary to unplug the unit restart it eject the disc and totally reset all menu items which were randomly reset to various settings worse some settings are no longer selectable one other movie would not even play in the machine forcing me to use the trusty jvc unit i must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what i read at this forum and other ones these units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption i recommend looking elsewhere,negative

just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced this is a 5 00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit it will protect against scratching but only the areas of the unit you re not really concerned about the screen is totally exposed so it can be scratched when in the unit i m sure that s so you can see the screen better but a clear protective cover \( that can open and close \) over the screen would have been nice anyway at 25 00 this is too much to spend i m ordering a leather cover with a kick stand \( which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table \) for less than the price of this product i feel i just flushed 25 00 bucks down the drain hopefully you will not,negative

angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5 star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman she focuses entirely on the black power movement in closing this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves,positive

i enjoyed this book having read other non fiction frontier books however i must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools objects etc i could have done without i would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker because such descriptions were so detailed if you re a technical hands on person then you probably would like knowing how items tools were built from raw materials in the frontier but for me i was more interested in the story than the instructionals,positive
this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing his book is mostly life stories and stupid ones at that some teeter the line of racism he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil fat black woman and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on race and besides that his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired and there is no self initiation for the type of voodoo he s talking about i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help his title is also misleading because voodoo ussually refers to hoodoo and vodun ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one he s just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life experiences are even worth tellin this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about,negative

mere words cannot express how pleased i am with my copy of 501 french verbs very user friendly well organized a gem i am currently working between learning spanish and french between the two i feel that french is the more difficult language now how to speak the language the accent sentence formation idioms for all the beauty of this reference book no one comes even close to equaling behind the wheel french for teaching you how to put all these verbs together and actually speak the language like the natives if you re just trying to get through a college french course requirement or never plan on really speaking the language then 501 french verbs is perfectly fine all by its sweet self however if you do want to do more than read french literature and plan on hitting the streets in france someday then by all means combine this fabulous book with behind the wheel french cds they also have a revised version for the same price that comes with a terrific book that is very instructional and easy to use \( same price \) with answers right on the same page english translations the whole nine yards makes it very easy to learn french,positive

set in venice at the end of world war ii hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old american colonel and renata a young and very pretty italian contessa loss is a recurring theme the death of many of the colonel s subordinates in combat the break up of his earlier marriage to a career woman and the severe injury to one of the colonel s hands from which he suffers constant pain the colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short what gives the novel so much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion renata and the colonel have for one another renata seeks to comfort the colonel and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness the colonel lovingly calls renata daughter hemingway tells this tale in the deceptively simple direct and matter of fact style for which he is justly celebrated i could have done without the duck hunting sequences and some of the colonel s more obvious macho behavior but hemingway being hemingway understandably could not this is a lovely and sad story filled with the yearnings of its two lead characters,positive

the miernik dossier was shockingly good before this i had never read anything by mccarry in fact i had never even heard the man s name i was lucky to come across a review of this re issued work in a magazine now i am collecting everything by him the story follows an odd assortment of people some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents as they travel south through europe into africa for the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if miernik is who he says he is the writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure in that sense the miernik dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel but yet it goes way beyond that it is also a highly compelling character study with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters this makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are the miernik dossier is a highly entertaining read true spy literature in the vein of ashenden that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories mysteries or simply great writing i cannot wait to read this book again,positive

at first glance this is a great book however once you ve read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration the author illustrator and publisher should be ashamed of themselves we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children s books as well this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind however,negative

as a former history major and teacher i am very familiar with the history of the crusades from the western point of view they have been portrayed in literature movies and history they have been glamorized and vilified by westerners for centuries reading amin maalouf s rendering of this familiar story from the view point of arab chroniclers was like looking through alice s looking glass at a world that is backwards from the one we know here we don t have just crusaders advernturers or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray but invaders barbarians and enemies of god himself this book is a must read for everyone who is concerned about events in the middle east today it sheds light on a crucial time in history that affects the psyche of muslims who are living right now especially helpful is the epilogue in which maalouf explains how the collective memory of the crusades colors the way many middle easterners see the west it is not riveting but very readable considering it is a translation i enjoyed it and learned a lot,positive

this is where ordering a book through the internet is a little disappointing as you can t browse the book before purchasing it camping activities for kids is very light on the activities it does a good job of laying out items that should be brought along on ones first camping trip but falls short on suggesting outdoor activities for kids the activities that are suggested are a little simplistic for example laying sticks apart from one another and pretending it s a river and then have the kids jump over it and playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls i was hoping for more endepth activities if it s your first time camping this books okay but if you ve camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the book falls short so look for something else,negative

as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled drawing people a technical guide for beginners and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery instead of a full out disappointment not that i blame the author solely most of the blame lies at my door i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure brune hogath s book aside \( another devastating disappointment \) and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art a school that i am still deciding on attending that instead of going my normal route \( ordering the book through the store checking it out in person and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount \) i impulsively bought the book only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews \( which all looked favorable \) now i realise my folly and am yet determining whether i ll pay for it \( i e keep the book \) i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience and i d say that experience shows equally in all areas not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through the problem is at least in my opinion that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing and it doesn t for the most part roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing the other three fourths talk about how to properly hold your drawing implement how to properly position yourself if you are drawing from a live modle maintaing a daily sketchbook researching your subject matter the relationships between the head neck and shoulders drawing hands drawing feet drawing eyes and a whole slew of other i wouldn t say irrelavent because they are relavent but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips again something bradley discusses on one single page the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing she didn t bother mentioning that how pants typically bunch up while you re walking seen from the head on profile three quaters and back view another topic she failed to mention some examples of evening formal attire vs day clothes how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up the effect of wearing multiple layers at once achieving that perfect windswept look and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide maybe i m being too harsh on bradley after all she does mention in her preface that there aren t a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure and compared to the standard how to books she s leaps and bounds ahead of the rest oh yeah that s another thing she doesn t outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom base the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere note the ripples or some junk like that back to me not being to harsh on bradley i guess in reading she is was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing for all who have read this drawn out rant two maybe three people and think i m all talk trust me if i had the skills i d come up with my own series of how to draw books and address all of my issues as is i m pretty good at drawing dynamic figures but the second i add clothing they become flat lifeless caricatures and i don t see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much as is my own artistic habits \( drawing from magazines online pics and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion \) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book you re better off doing what you ve always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics if you could write a review mentioning them somehow recommend them to me or whatever i d be eternally in your debt,negative
i m not a cosmologist but stephen hawking s universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending the language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper moreover the pictures are second rate pre contact lense hubble knock offs \( despite being published in 1997 \) and the book has very little to do with stephen hawking sure he wrote the foreward and did some editing but it lacks the wit and wonder of a hawking work naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading i am a chemist and despite this filkin s descriptions of chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb down ideas that aren t dumb downable and didn t include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts \( like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration \) if you want to learn some cosmology read a brief history of time or a short history of the universe these are simply written but informative works that won t leave you waiting for substance,negative

first of all i did not exactly read this biography instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work \( i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way and still been able to read many more technology related books \) i had great expectations from this book having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson richard carwardine or doris goodwin i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character in this context i find mr mccullough s use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america i also enjoy direct quotes from letters speaches autobiographies as they help me refine my impressions of the context \( the period the relationships to contemporary characters \) surounding a promonent figure usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams time and i missed hearing the voice of john adams instead this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author finally having read other biographies of the founding fathers i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin all in all my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions had i known that i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough s fictional work,negative

i received my ph d in theoretical and applied mechanics from one of the best u s universities and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics before starting the reading of this book i was in the agreeable mood with the author s that machines can never be human and that ai will retain \( if not forever \) for a very long time its name unreal but now i am dismayed the author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view making simple topics sound difficult and making diffcult ones look impossibble the inclusion of his strange tilings is strange all in all the book does not make sense moreover his note to the reader \( which is patronizing arrogant and deceiving \) and his prologue and epilogue \( which are at best cynical \) should have warned me not to venture any further i cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers and most of all if this is the author s usual way of communicating his ideas for his students luckily i did not buy this book for one person who could not stand reading through it dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor,negative

this is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs jones a welsh methodist everton fc supporter london hack and oxford \( arts \) graduate goes to live in parma italy where his beloved has established herself he divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent english and his motifs will allow the first chapter discusses nuances of the italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that italy is a much more nuanced country than england and that its culture is infinitely more refined an entire chapter brings the nuances of italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down the football allows us to place italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it the last chapter is an entire ode to italy it is written largely in the second person and it tells of you going through the village and everything there appealing to the aesthetic in you the english is beautiful and it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm glow mission accomplished the chapter on italy s catholic religion and its protestant and other minorities could have done with much improvement italy s catholicism is more complicated than the padre pio cult and the protestants of the north surely have their faults as well the chapter looks like it came from several previous publications he wrote the politics chapters build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist factions are still at war with each other and that politicians like berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends he does a good job of tying the warring world war two factions in with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles he does not like berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide this fact my opinion of this book is that jones sat down with his material and tied it all together into a very passable but rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the money being charged,positive
i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it said parent would have no clue as it sure isn t mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading but this time this particular book slipped under my radar she told me that it had a reference to a gay character which i took to mean just a passing reference but when i read the book it was treated more seriously than i thought even going so far as to have the two girls kiss it is inexcusable both on ms pierce s part and on scholastic s no matter what the author s personal beliefs it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents i believe that as a parent i m the one responsible for what my children see and do but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision anise hollingshea,negative
first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others ike took advantage of her tina her self said she cared very much for him cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on so she released her autobiography in 1986 well after her come back in 1984 while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic excusse of a come back,negative
i know that as a wolf lover i am a bit biased but i would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect you see in this story three children are left alone a wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in because he wants to eat them unfortunately that s where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill this is just another stupid book that summed up says wolves are evil ugly beasts who attack people we have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children yep the wolf is depicted as evil in this book why couldn t they make it something that actually hurts people like a bear or a mountain lion ignorance that s why the wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book see near the end the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts they plan on luring him into their trap to get rid of him the wolf instantly falls for it which is lame wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on earth it s practically traditional to make children s books with wolves as villains and the chinese seem to loath wolves but this book crosses the line don t let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage stupid man eating beasts if they already think so you d be neglecting mankind s need to know things even more by letting them read it in other words it s a terrible book,negative
the burning was a big letdown after reading bentley little s masterful book dispatch i seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while bentley was ill and couldn t write who knows i love this guy and can t tell you how disappointed i was while one of the top 5 horror writers working today bentley little seems to be hit or miss with his stories i simply just did not enjoy reading this new release it seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick and with everything he was trying to do none of it not one moment was scary shadow creatures performing random oral sex creeping fungus talking voices in the microwave deformed goblins peering in windows skeletons climbing out of mud pits tunnels filled with moving corpses and a runaway ghost train crashing into the white house was just too silly it reminded me of his previous work the return another disappointment containing silly bizarre and unrealistic situations the scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value suspense and atmospheric quality the book had many problems that pulled me out of the story one of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day bentley needs to do what he does best which is to come up with a gimmick focus everything on that single idea and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling it worked with the store the association the policy and dispatch just to name a few let s hope he gets back on track with his next book,negative
i once read an article in horn book magazine \( a review source of titles and articles on children s literature \) that lamented the millions of poor translations of hans christian andersen polluting the minds of our young people today the review mentioned that stories like the snow queen which were originally written in a snappy vernacular have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their american translators with this idea fresh in my mind i found myself in possession of a very particular copy of the snow queen and i was able to test this theory myself now due to the wacky nature of amazon com the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this anderson story you will see that some of the reviews refer to nilesh mistry s some refer to the audio book some to eileen kernaghan s and some \( god help us all \) to mary engelbreit none of these however are the version that i am reviewing after careful consideration i selected the edition retold by amy ehrlich and illustrated by susan jeffers the ehrlich jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from thumbelina to cinderella with this 1982 classic edition they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of andersen s riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life most people don t remember that the snow queen begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad by a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day \( the details of this accident are left unclear \) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere if these splinters enter your eye everything will look ugly to you if they enter your heart it will turn instantly to ice got it good cause sure enough two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named kai when this happens he stops playing with his best playmate gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale snow queen gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures she escapes an overly loving old witch is taken in by a prince and princess falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin and at last saves kai from the snow queen herself by the end of the book neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it obviously the snow queen is one big ole story about growing up the idea of the devil s mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart well that s just another way of describing adolescence is it not andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale east of the sun west of the moon in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman heck tam lin was probably an influence as well the best version of this particular story i ever read was by kara dalkey it was a tale named the lady of the ice garden and can be found in firebirds an anthology of original science fiction and fantasy it is not however appropriate for children kids today will probably look at the snow queen and instantly think of the white witch from the lion the witch and the wardrobe i cannot think however that this is a bad thing as for the jeffers ehrlich version it s all right as an illustrator jeffers has apparently decided to make kai and gerta definitely children i guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the snow queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the snow queen s dress and every strand of her white white hair there is the odd stylistic choice here and there though when gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals i can t think that they re comfortable \( or even particularly practical \) the illustrations have been created according to the book using a fine line pen with ink and dyes they were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased as a result the book is as soft as a colored pencil but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink obviously i don t know enough about the original version of the snow queen \( or as andersen called it sneedronningen \) to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots at any rate it tells the full story warts and all and will provide them with what may well be the most freudian toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains a fun edition of a rather odd tale,positive

this is definitely not one of my favorite books about stocks the title of the book is a little deceiving the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits chapters 1 4 are about general info such as you must buy and sell to make money don t hold for a long time you must research the stock before purchase eps must increase every year i didn t find anything in those chapters that i didn t already know chapters 5 10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell once again the author talks about the obvious buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques the bull put spread this is not something that i use or will use in my trading chapter 12 is the concluding chapter,negative
this book has its good points if anything it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor but it is not very accurate the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you or if they don t describe you at all this messes up the results and it did not describe me very well i am not just in denial i have taken a lot of personality type tests like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths so although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees i v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate the company i work for has done this and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths \( according to this book \) are very unhappy in their new positions your money can be spent better elsewhere i say its only worth about 10,negative
in 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the united states was 19 806 37 million people in the us live at or below this level ron sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth in just generosity sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in america and it is a compelling vision sider s vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society s structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty drawing upon biblical study sider presents the goal of an economy of justice every person or family has access to productive resources \( land money knowledge \) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community \( 81 \) sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare minimum wage tax credits health care and education reform showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work empower the poor and strengthen families sider ends with this troubling question do enough christians really care this book should be required reading for any that do,positive
let s make this clear i won t put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself so this is going to be short and sweet this book is a glorified magazine worth 14 95 tops the pitfalls of bookbuying online i guess you never know what you are going to get anyways most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared the text portion however brief is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared the uninitiated might even be led to believe that kodak and konica are the only game in town in infrared films throughout the book the author treats these two as the coke and pepsi of infrared films i m going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same,negative
people say again and again that philosophy doesn t really progress that we arestill occupied with the same philosophical problems as were thegreeks but the people who say this don t understand why ishas to be so it is becauseour language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions as longas there continues to be a verb to be that looks as if it functions in the same way as to eat and to drink as long as we stillhavethe adjectives identical true false possible as long as we continueto talk of a river of time of an expanseof space etc etc people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up and what smore this satisfies a longing for the transcendent because insofar as peoplethinkthey can see the limits of human understanding theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language ambition is the death of thought these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago \( but most people have yet to find this out \) dennett though he has been a philosopher for some40 years is one them it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist john searle studied under famous wittgensteinians \( searle with john austin dennett with gilbert ryle \) but searle got the point and dennett did not dennett is a hard determinist \( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door \) and perhaps this is due to ryle whose famous book the concept of mind \( 1949 \) continues to be reprinted that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein ryle \( andmany others since \) have exposed in detail byaccident just before this book i had read the minds i which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981 they made some bad mistakes \( see my review \) and saddest of all they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess nagel s what is like to be a bat and an early version of john searle s chinese room argument explaining why computers don t think nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat s mind would be like searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does \( eg it can translate chinese without understanding it \) likewise we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad or just intelligible for many philosophical and scientific concepts our use of the words consciousness choice freedom intention particle thinking determines wave cause happened event \( and so on endlessly \) are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy \( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved \) chaos reigns wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this unfortunately he died inhis prime his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind \( language \) worksand he never wroteany popular books so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few searle is one of the world s leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett swork his review consciousness explained away of dennetts 1991 book consciousness explained and his book the mystery of consciousness are very well known and show in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing why neither dennett \( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic \) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem ie how do you conceptualizeconsciousness many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is \( mostly \) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious thinks etc he just points out that we don t have any idea how this happens searle characterizes as intellectualpathology the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how unsurprisingly there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book there arehowever many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is like most people it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 s and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with dennett says \( p98 \) that his view is compatibilism ie that free will \( whichi hopewe can equate with choice \) is compatible with determinism \( ie that there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future p25 \) he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity however the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice in the sense we normally understand it disappears and we are left with choice which is something we cannot choose naturally this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book consciousness explained it is remarkable that at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works \( or how an atom works for that matter \) that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote and what smore this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent because insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see the limits of human understanding theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these the relation between language thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost if one is very very careful some understanding is possible but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand there are at least 3 different topics here \( evolution of our brain choice and morality \) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms there is however no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms \( or his favorite example the game of life running on a computer \) are isomorphic with reality he knows that quantum indeterminacy \( or the uncertainty principle \) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined \( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom \) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with by extension its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain \( whatever that may be \) however the universe is a big place and its been around a long time \( perhaps forever \) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state the notion there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness \( or any other emergent phenomenon \) if so they will definitely win at least one nobel prize for not only will they have explained consciousness they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence \( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones \) so they would have to solve the easy problem \( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time ignoring uncertainty \) and the hard one \( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc \) and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable even for one atom or a vacuum as it would require an infinite amount of computer time but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls but physics is made of notions just as fantastic \( uncertainty entanglement wave particle duality schrodinger s dead alivecat etc \) and as feynmann said many times nobody understandsphysics many think nobody ever will on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our robotic teams are put togther over a lifetime of growth and experience this is a bald dismissal of human nature of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference but for whom nobody but philosophers we make choices what s the problem one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem what are consciousness pain yellow intention matter quarks gravity etc i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice this shows that there is something strange about such questions wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode decoupled modes permit thinking about the past planning for the future guessing the mental states of others etc but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think john will try to steal my wallet rather than just imagining that john might do it confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode enter the realm of pathology some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way they lose control of which mode they are in eg notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode normal mode eg what is that lion doing was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next evolved later this was probably never a problem for animals any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes hence we have philosophy and this book which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode let us alter wittgenstein s quote to read as longas there continues to be a verb to decide that looks as if it functions in the same way as to eat and to drink as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action of saying i wish i had done otherwise etc etc people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up as withmost philosophy books nearly every page often every paragraph changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story etc and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives like we count on food and water but who ever outside philosophy standing in front of lunch counter full of food ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones \( this is not a trivial observation \) the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children so i would say that normally nobody counts on having choice but rather we just choose on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice and that it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic but it is not and on page 13 it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning deciding promising resenting etc but that these are built in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood there is no evidence that they change as we grow or are in any way subject to our beliefs only that they mature just as our body does on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it do we believe we see an apple feel a pain are happy the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can t meaningfully then say that we still believe it \( except as a joke etc \) the inference engine can run in decoupled \( belief \) mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice but dennett is saying thisis the universal case if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else consciousness seeing thinking etc if we take this seriously \( and he says the serious problems of free will \) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life then madness is minutes away on page 65 et seq he discusses causation intention and the informal predicates that we use to describe atoms etc but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents \( ie animals or people or things like them ie ghosts or gods \) are involved we use our concepts \( engines \) for agency intuitive psychology social minds etc to decide how to behave there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines depending on the precise situation discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics agency ontological categories etc of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein s many incisive comments on causation intention deciding nor of searle s now classic works on intention and social reality he spends much time on ainslie s book breakdown of will in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties \( ie inference engines \) by which we evaluate probable outcomes hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism emotion and economics but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published it was bingham s idea amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson \( 1992 \) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising indeed they are and in fact they are standard parts of economic evolutionary and cognitive theory but unfortunately he makes little reference to the other work in these fields all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text again he gets things backwards as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines as he notes hundreds of experiments with the prisoner s dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people s choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious they are much slower and less reliable so there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought dennett says we make ourselves so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results if we or others do not we feel guilt outrage resentment etc then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved our genes make us so we can t \( mostly \) do otherwise not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50 000 and some millions of years ago in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making \( from certain angles \) he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some \( unspecified \) properties possessed by traditional free will the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice he insists \( top pg 226 \) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility but making ourselves so we couldn t do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function nor does it seem to leave any room for morality as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so normally if someone asks us to move our hand we know what counts as having a choice but typical of philosophers i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position at this point he also starts his discussion of libet s well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time on page 253 et seq he sneaks in his definition of conscious will the brains user illusion of itself which has as one of its main roles providing me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times and illusory or not conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action he says the trick we need is to see that i control what is happening inside the simplification barrier where decision making happens mental events become conscious by entering into memory the process of self description is what we are the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space \( the brain \) and time \( memories \) he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous \( everyone who can follow this and really understands \) i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness and the real self out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced many will say he took the words out of their mouth but i would say it s incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe \( making the obvious extensions of such claims \) was gone long beforewegot this far on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals this is a stunning denial of human nature \( ie genetics and evolution \) coming from the person who wrote darwin s dangerous idea presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space \( the brain and other people \) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness \( line 6 from bottom \) he says consciousness is a user interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain \( you will have to suffer through consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either \) though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades \( social mind intuitive psychology coalitional intuitions etc \) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture thats ok but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes we are also told here that r d \( by which he means evolution here but other things elsewhere \) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality i am sure that he will get little agreement on this it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates \( and earlier \) long before spoken language \( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain \) he continues morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes which is an amazing \( and totally incorrect \) thing to say even if he was only referring to memes on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our bland dispositions to cooperate they mean nothing to us but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being \( eg autism \) i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions like all the templates are accessible to consciousness we may decide our cheating was justifiable or forgive someone else s cheating but we still know it was cheating \( ie we cannot change the engine \) i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings another issue is that as culture developed one had to make many important or moral type decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer on pg 267 he says that we now replace our free floating rationales \( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines \) with reflection and mutual persuasion and on pg 286 he says that it is a child s upbringing demanding and giving reasons that affects moral reasoning again he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self which takes responsibility it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education \( memory \) and sharing it s clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ought and is unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago ie they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes \( eg see the blank slate \) he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like praiseworthy were shaped over millennia by culture while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess \( evolutionarily stable strategy \) can produce morality his idea here is that genetic r d produces dim understandings of morals and then culture \( memetics \) produces variations and clarifications i would say that we all know and much research has made clear that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore which i started reading 30 years ago since it s authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us but there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho s 200 books than anywhere in philosophy one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities there is no sign here nor in anything he has done that dennett is morally superior after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them it seems clear that like all of us he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines so how much opportunity is there to improve our morality it seems clear \( eg see pinker s the blank slate \) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties on average maybe 5 of the variation in moral behavior \( variations are the only thing we can study \) is due to our own efforts the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is and if one did we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first to return to the quote at the beginning ambition is the death of thought indeed though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts,negative
i bought this book before my first trip to austria i had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations that turned out to be true what shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that austrian women are strong minded and independent and organize their homelife well although many go to work this book might have some value for a person who had never left their english speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach it also provides some amusing anecdotes about language \( especially viennese \) and useful info about festivals mostly though this book was good for reading aloud to austrian friends i would quote it as an iron clad authority when their behavior didn t quite match the book s version and thereby amused them tremendously lynn hoffman author of the new short course in wine and the forthcoming novel bang bang from kunati books isbn 978160164000,negative

i am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well i read this book about ten years ago and i read it regularly every couple of years the story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a run down community is a classic of american literature what this book and o connor s other novel the last hurrah apart is the writing in an era where writers seem to challenge one another to be more like faukner and less comprehensible to the average man o connor wrote very well and his language is beautiful from this fine prose arises really deep characters which are flawed and so easily identifiable to us all,positive
this was by far the best genero kenzie novel of the series i loved this book everything about it in this one you really got to see the emotional side of bubba made him more likeable the storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down i was happy to see angie and patrick back together the ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book i m scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why lehane hasn t published another it s been 5 years i will be watching for it,positive

i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they hadn t a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little,negative
i thought this was the most boring book i ve ever read i hated it and about 1 3 of the way through i quit reading it,negative
this entire book reads like an 8th grade research paper from an uncountable amount of grammatical and spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences \( literally quotes retyped word for word pages apart \) it s difficult not to get irritated while reading this the information on weezer is great but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band and gives too much information on things that even the most obsessed fan won t care about unfortunately this appears to be the only book on weezer out right now so if you want to learn more about the band in book form this is all you ve got i suggest just browsing around their official website because it s obvious that s where the author got quite a bit of his information don t waste your money,negative
this is the book that trackers and naturalists have needed for a long time it s finally here and it s outstanding now when i take apart an owl pellet i ll be able to determine what the owl was eating and hence what small wildlife is abundant in that area and when i m out and discover part of a skull from a mammal bird amphibian or reptile i ll be able to find what that is too mark elbrock has done it again an instant classic and a book that all trackers and naturalists should have in their collection,positive
ok this book is funny the first time you look through it overall i would not recomend this book because it s one of those books that you ll just look through one time and one time only yeah there are a lot of positions but they are all repeated in the book like five times with different names and another thing there are a lot of positions that are not even posible and some only with a giant swing or how about a horizantal or verticle pole yeah many people have those in their houses but seriously the only positions that you ll be able to do are the ones that you know already,negative
there s a ton of paper in this book overboard in my opinion wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious i ve taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information hasn t been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california,negative
excellent book a good guide to improve project managemen,positive
well the fact that i m writing a review about this book while it s sitting open on my desk next to my computer open and not being read might be some evidence of how i m enjoying this book this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn t be so difficult this book is not clear or easy to understand at all every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page \( \) making this work look like a research project for a phd publication i have the casebook in this series and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity and it turns to be true this book might be good if you re advanted contracts and want to know every little detail or as an advanced reference later on to look something up like in an encyclopedia some concepts which should be pretty clear just get too in depth coverage in this book it s too complex for a first year student sometimes it starts describing the different views out there and then there s a jumble in your head as to what the law really is i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors,negative

in the chapter about south asia the authors have written quite a lot about the kashmir problem but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350 000 kashmiri hindus that took place in 1990 i just cannot believe that they don t know about this,negative
the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states edmund burke could he see our century never would concede that a consumption society so near suicide is the end for which providence has prepared man but wait the conservative mind was first published in 1953 the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell meanwhile burke a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times there are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society kirk writes what men really are seeking or ought to seek is not the right to govern themselves but the right to be governed well but what he offers is a lack of true representation the author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender is it so surprising that kirk lauds some of the worst racists in american history like nathanial bedford forrest whom he describes as magnificent before quoting his racist vitriol in a particularly galling move he referrers to pro slavery advocate john c calhoun as a defender of minorities and praises john randolph for among other things opposing doctrines of racial equality kirk goes on about calhoun s support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the fugitive slave act which forced federal officials and law officials in northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of 1000 fine he supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery for calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern anti slavery agitation and supports calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty although calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty one wonders if kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the calhoun mounted a strong protest against domination by class or region another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state the duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line quoting samuel coleridge the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control sounding like the inspiration for disgraced chief justice roy moore russell kirk urges that state and church ought never to be separate entities true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit it rises far superior to earthly law being indeed the source of all law kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of god but never draws a distinction i have to wonder if like the modern reconstructionist kirk wanted to see the laws of leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers he never explains how one might recognize a law of god besides using prejudice the third thread would be kirk s anti intellectual \( or perhaps pro stupid \) stance he refers to human reason as puny and impotent and claims that we find the mind of god in prejudice and tradition prejudice he writes is of ready application in the emergency it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision skeptical puzzled and unresolved actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for god and those in higher stations and authority in order to grab the golden fleece of populism conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident like calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade i found russell kirk s salesmanship of conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day,negative

mark liberman and geoffrey k pullum could be accused of making the best of an already satisfactory situation in publishing this book that reiterates their ongoing blog on linguistics but for this reader having never visited their blog \( until now \) this book is a treasure trove of quips and oops and pooh bahs and evidences of the strangely twisted manner in which we communicate written in a casual style that makes the faux pas revelations more cogent the authors share embarrassingly poor writing from the media from authors from those in control of the country \( as though the mentality of the us might somehow be reflected in the malapropisms of george w yikes \) and yet reading this blogline of information never seems vitriolic criticism is one of the most substantial ways to create change and hopefully this book and blogline will focus many minds on the misuse of the english language perhaps effecting some much needed corrections far from the madding gerund \( didn t you always wonder why thomas hardy used that word in the title of his great novel far from the madding crowd \) is a book to pleasure the mind and humor and a fine resource for perusing before writing or speaking to a group of wise souls so maybe it is a print form of a blogline but for those of us who tire of wading through the computer for reading it is a complete \( compleat \) pleasure grady harp june 0,positive

as a beef eating hindu i am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat i browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing first it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes it clearly had a bias which turned me off second i am generally up to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book there were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers \( the government of india demands be ritually burned \) later i searched on google with the book title and words ban government of india and found no news reports relating any government of india attempts at banning this book there were no reports on ban by allahabad high court either all i found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions third i found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions it basically left me disappointed and i am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter,negative
there is little more i can contribute to this literary masterpiece even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work gustave flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected madame bovary with care he worked on the novel for nearly six years during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times often spending days perfecting a single paragraph the result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty madame bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine emma bovary as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth she exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle class humdrum lifestyle flaubert s realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal in perfect contrast to emma flaubert introduces charles bovary a proto typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer soon after their wedding emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling charles and yearns for a romantic interlude flaubert represents the absolute clich of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding unimpressive and unnoticed middle class man flaubert brings all facets of human personas full circle with the shy well mannered and well liked young man next door leon with a slow blossoming relationship with emma leon leaves for paris to study law upon his return and with a little experience the two become lovers flaubert s portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore thereafter the degeneracy of emma s lifestyle is evident and she is brought to the brink of destruction in madame bovary gustave flaubert gives us a vivid and life like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small town people living in france during the mid nineteenth century flaubert s descriptions are detailed and beautiful and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing opening with first person narration that sometimes shifts to third person has earned gustave flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century,positive

turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose months after i gave up on it i have a door that rattles if it s not wedged open and t o c is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own i struggled oh how i struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters i stirred the pages wildly while i waited for the plot to thicken i fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier i searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if i had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don t need a subject a verb and an object or even a permutation of two out of three i left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it i offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car i considered lighting the fire with it i wondered whether if i took just a few pages a day i could eat it and get rid of the evidence i offered it to my mother in law for christmas i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt and then eventually voila the rattling door what a fine tome t o c is another few hundred pages and i could have used it as a sea anchor for the titanic,negative
flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn s political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn s politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i m still looking,negative
gunstories by beth atkin is a book that should be mandatory reading for all students and discussed with parents teachers and friends young people discuss guns in a positive light and a negative light as with any subject it is only with education and knowledge that a change can be made i definitely recommend this book and hope that it can be a fixture in all elementary middle and high schools \( p s if you are a school librarian order a copy \) shelley \( henderson nv \) a fascinating look at a difficult topic many viewpoints are presented the book is fair and balanced but the stories of gun violence just naturally have more impact than those of kids who enjoy range shooting the dichotomy between rural and urban viewpoints is striking the wonderful photography really adds to the text recommended diane \( cedar rapids ia \) despite the fact that i m not really in support of guns it is nice to read a book on such a controversial topic that does not carry a political agenda it s not your typical pro con book either it gives actual perspectives from real life people teen people who just want to tell it like it is amy \( fort worth tx,positive

it s always easy to criticize somebody s personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable actresses and not stars of the studio era so it comes pretty natural to ask is esther williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook margaret sullavan was grace kelly s talent so overwhelming to forget that miriam hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as lubitsch wyler mamoulian hawks and vidor to stunning results what was wrong with mary astor s acting and what is right with kim novak s actress to me means patricia neal or shelley winters norma shearer or natalie wood were stars think about it,negative

this book is probably the worst written i ve ever encountered it was so flawed as to be considered literature alice walker tries to one up harriet beecher stowe in writing about brutality titles like these are weapons used in the anti black male agenda this society has long perpetuated all the men depicted in this book are one dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting the women are portrayed as martyred forlorn pseudo saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women i ve learned long ago when absolutes such as these are presented a greater agenda is at work there are no real men in this book only distorted caricatures of black masculinity i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst i find this title as dangerous as hitler s mien kampf in it s portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible true there are criminally abusive men in every culture but there are also forthright upstanding men as well to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about harriet beecher stowe s fictional uncle tom s cabin sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men this book is fiction however it is not presented as such i m sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations however i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book in my opinion this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers viewers of the people within it i don t find it a testament to the strength of black women at all i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes the further distortion of african american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman i m sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book feminist racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women most definitely not i doubt it would have even found a publisher america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african american culture my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion whatever ms walker s motivations were in writing this novel i m sure mercenary incentives were not discounted this is racist misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature,negative
this was a required text for one of my graduate courses and i didn t expect to enjoy it much it wasn t far into the book that i began to resonate with some of the struggles for racial harmony articulated by perkins and rice in chapter 1 spencer perkins states emphatically the civil rights movement has run its course and we ve gotten just about all you can expect to get from a political movement i a white guy took offense at the thought that someone would declare the struggle for civil rights obsolete his point is well made through the development of this and subsequent chapters the move toward reconciliation must move from race to grace regardless of your religious affiliations if you are engaged in civil rights causes or racial reconciliation you would be remiss to neglect this ground breaking tome pax erik,positive
i have got to say that this is definitely the best cheesecake book ever initially i was shopping around for one since my boyfriend s favorite dessert was cheesecake i ran across this and decided to get it well one of the best choices i could ever make i think this is an amazing book starting from the recipes which are so numerous and so varied that they have to be divided into beverage based chocolate vanilla candy etc even one for light cheesecakes honestly deciding which one to try the first time around was the toughest challenge when starting out well i followed the instructions clearly as well as the first section on tips to avoid it cracking and boy did it ever come out wonderfully i never looked back i ve baked from it endlessly for some years now tasting practically all of the recipes included it s gotten to the point where i may soemtimes tweak the recipe and or ingredients a bit and it still comes out great my family has enjoyed all sorts of different flavors and many of my family members and friends have converted and use nothing but this to bake cheesecakes also my copy is so beat up from use it may be time to get a new one did i mention that this is also a beautiful book full of wonderful \( yummy looking \) glossy pictures my only \( tiny \) complaint is that on occasion some of the ingredients may be a little hard to get but nothing too major and definitely nothing s that stopped me yet i do have other cheesecake books which people have given me over the years but due to simplicity astounding variety and plain old wonderful results this is the one i recommend the most,positive
dave barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from the miami herald there is a huge margin in difference of quality in boogers are my beat than in his initial non fiction books such as dave barry s bad habits boogers are my beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you don t want to put down until the back cover dave barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you can t use the towels hanging in the bathroom the salt lake city olympics babies on airlines north dakota bear in the big blue house and cell phones to name just a few his article written the day after september 11 and one written a year after about the philadelphia crashed plane are also included which prove barry could have been a serious writer if he had pursued that career thankfully he didn t because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is his carl hiaasen style fiction novel tricky business big trouble isn t bad either check them out along with his other non fiction novels as well,positive

if you are a christian this book isn t for you it is full of blashphemy concluding that we must forgive god and that we must love god even if he isnt perfect kusher even has the will to say that god would not be god without our love for him at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden when god said let us make man in our image he was speking to animals and creation kusher explains that god created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution since when was god in need of forgiveness isnt it that god so loved the world and it wasnt us that loved god i have no words in describing this book it is full of error because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person why do bad things happen to good people wrong question there are no good people in the world in the first place for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god the world is in sin the world does not have good people only by the grace of god through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book it hasnt helped 4 million people but it lied to them kusher please turn from your ways and come to jesus then will you understand the life question why,negative

with every grisham book i read i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense but to insert other elements to make this human as well for once we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain however this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune however she does not know this a lawyer is sent to find her and in the process undergoes a fundamental change of his own this story takes place in washington maryland west virginia and the rain forests along the brazilian bolivian border in typical grisham fashion he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight you can envision the rainforest and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o riley this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue the pages literally turn themselves do not start this novel before going to bed or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down,positive

salvador completely discredits joan didion and all of her books the two weeks she is believed to have lived in el salvador was actually a mere four hours any truths in this book and there are but a handful have been obtained by outside sources not by her own research i lived in el salvador when she came in to gather info for her story it is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the salvadorans to effect personal gain if you want to read fiction go ahead she s a good storyteller as a service to yourself however keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes the only reason i have the book at all is that my father gave it to me what a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash,negative

i was eager to read this book but after reading it i was left completely flat the rest of the iceberg hardly smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading sports illustrated or any minnesota sports page he admits he s not a fan of football but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career this book is touted as his full and complete story so we learned he was watching ren stimpy during his nfl draft wow are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read how about telling us more of the inside details how did smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player who were his friends that he could trust and when did he need that trust what thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent what was he doing when he was goofing off and missing class all summer which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at ohio state when and why did he begin using pot if football is not smart enough for him why doesn t he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging what happened to plans for medical school we know the stories of football those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented i also felt smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of america who is attacking him why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much highly paid athlete stories are sorry for the pun a dime a dozen he tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy the truth is many people will take a job for 5 less than a co worker because yes they value things other than money and yes they are happy to have a job leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers it felt like i was reading an average high school creative writing project i did this i did that i went to bed next day half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy pop music smith notes less than 50 percent of americans read at a 10th grade level well this book certainly won t tax the reading ability of too many people one lesson from this book is that smith had opportunities to swallow his pride take some coaching and come up with a better solution this book is another one of those times he should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance build the characters help us feel their stories instead smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions sorry but compared to other autobiographies this was not an emotional book i m sure smith is all the things that mike gutter says he is such as thoughtful honest trustworthy dependable passionate but i felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book instead we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg,negative

some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge an aquaduct or the entrance to a castle it probably wasn t too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room my guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room but as soon as one was built i suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created and that an artist could transform this sky into a vision of heaven this book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth it is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth,positive
unlike most dystopian novels which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future a clockwork orange focuses on the nature of the individual in the future our protagonist is alex only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal roving the streets with his band of friends taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him the boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless in fact the more helpless the victim it seems the more pleasure the boys take in the act the most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes they aren t doing any of this out of malice toward their targets in fact it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim they are creating mayhem just because it s fun for them everything changes however when one particular break in goes horribly awry and alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder there though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality then after two years he is chosen for a new experimental rehabilitation program designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in or even contemplate any acts of violence as we see however this treatment also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not he has to be good because he is programmed to be this of course raises the question central to the book does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice the book can be a little difficult to get in to at first predominantly because of burgess s unique style the story is narrated by alex and thus is written in the complex slang language invented by burgess for this book that the youth of this society engage in for example a sentence taken from the opening chapter he looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that \( pg 5 \) there is no glossary but if you stick with it you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters however if you find yourself having difficulty a nice comprehensive lexicon can be found on wikipedia if you search for english to nadsat \( due to review guidelines i am not allowed to include a direct link \) unfortunately it is alphabetized by the english equivalents not by the slang terms so looking up a word can be a little difficult one final note of interest the original british publication of a clockwork orange had 21 chapters as does the current american edition however when the book was first published in the united states the last chapter was dropped as burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout whether it is or isn t is up to you to decide but i can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book without the final part of the story in place the book offers a bleak message implying that human nature cannot really change on the other hand reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope beyond that burgess tells us in his introduction interpretation is up to you,positive
i have never been a fan of danielle steel s books and have only read a couple in my lifetime and those many years ago i m not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors extreme boredom insanity but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer s work actually i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was the writing was completely repetitive and superficial and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself it read like a poor book report and then he did this and then he did this and after that he did this and then he laughed we are told that the bachelors who struck me as commitment phobic a little neurotic and fairly immature despite their \( middle \) age but not necessarily toxic are decent likable guys but we never really see too much proof of that when the proof does come it s so ham handed as to be laughable charlie s eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character yeahsurerightwhatever most of the story is told through narration with little bits and pieces of ho hum dialogue the author adopted a third person point of view but there s certainly nothing omniscient about it and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable this is how men behave and relate to one another i find that hard to believe considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other i liked the female characters of the book initially they all seemed to be strong capable independent and emotionally healthy women but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous mountains out of molehills for instance gray the 50 year old artist who has always been phobic about family refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he s been with for several months and whom he claims to love nevermind the fact that he s known about the adult children since the very beginning nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy while gray and sylvia are new yorkers nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent self sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face to face visits evidently gray can t see beyond the fact that they are kids and therefore family and therefore not to be tolerated sorry but whatever sympathy i d developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity dump the weenie sylvia you can do better the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness and of course everything was wrapped up magically with sudden capitulation as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters their conflicts and resolution i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book and why i bothered reading i,negative
i am so passionate about this book it has answered all the life questions i have ever held although many people i have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to get into it for me i would say it is the best book i have ever read this is about the 5th copy i have purchased because when i lend it out somehow it is not returned and i want to have a copy to re read every now and then \( i will not be lending this one again,positive
over 20 years after it was published the story of the israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the plo \( bubba s jacques un s buddy yasser \) in lebanon is no less important interestingly lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of syrian occupation they have gone from the vegan dictator hafez assad murdering opponents and journalists to the syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists \( another killed last week 7 2005 \) in this review i will attempt to explain the story the left wing doves reporter s views \( and on so many levels his mistakes \) and most importantly to americans who love and support israel the correlation between israel s actions and our war on terror first to the journalists the main one being the left wing newspaper haraatz ze ev schiff as the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby mr schiff is a member of the israeli left dove peace now group this coalition consists of myopic people \( with all due respect \) that don t seem to understand good and evil just as our great president bush was criticized for denouncing the axis of evil \( he forgot to mention syria and the house of saud \) these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our their enemies this is what lead to the fraudulent oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting palestinian authority it is this authority that unleashed a wave of terror on israel immediately after clinton helped the murderer arafat receive a nobel peace prize fittingly arafat walked away from the clinton barak plan in 2000 which would have created a palestinian state which to this day \( 7 8 05 \) does not exist despite the charade of the road map the authors accuse prime minister sharon of illegally leading israel into the war in lebanon most of the books i ve read about israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit sharon he seems to be the donald rumsfeld of israel i don t live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation but he was democratically elected so most of the voters must disagree with the left s assessment of mr sharon \( yes i know his disengagement is an illegal abomination more on that later wear orange to support the settlers \) on page 39 mr ze ev describes sharon as a cynical headstrong executor who regarded the idf as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements and not necessarily defensive ones and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power those would prove to be the kindest words he would have for mr sharon on page 58 he accuses sharon of implementing a quasi coup d etat and on and on it goes the author also accuses sharon of duping the american government details forthcoming later on we learn of the courageous freedom fighter \( my emphasis \) arafat s decision to deploy all palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill israelis of course to this day the pa affiliated fatah and other groups use children to murder israeli civilians \( the best non child attack recently was the palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in israel who tried to kill innocent israeli doctors nurses using bomber pants great video of her discovering the bomb wouldn t activate however us msm mainstream media other than fox refused to air it \) on page 92 we learn of arafat crony and current pa leader abu mazen s \( the same oslo and road map violating terrorist supporting enabling holocaust denying chain smoking mazen that gw brazenly brought to the white house \) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of jews for murder throughout the story if indeed the cabinet was mislead we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences specifically a failure to call up the reserves to his credit and unlike journalists robert fisk \( pity the nation \) and thomas friedman \( ny times from lebanon to jerusalem \) mr schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by ray ban wayfarer wearing arafat even inside his own plo on page 147 we learn of palestinians killing palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to idf action in this episode three children were gunned down in front of their father on page 149 the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of idf members in discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation the author s ask was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries and further how would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem are you kidding me these members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace meanwhile the un the left doves the media and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to arafat s involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the plo prior to the lebanon operation in my humble view something had to be done prime minister begin agreed with sharon s initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in beirut page 152 features more america bashing culminating in an accusation that the us was an israeli dupe the story of the military operation is detailed completely and no discussion of the lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in sabrit and shatilla i ll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation but in short israel relied on their allies in lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists most assuredly after the palestinians brought havoc to these people they wanted revenge the result some civilian deaths to go along with the clean up operation and a rebuke of several israeli figures including prime minister sharon folks war is not pretty and the us faced similar choices in partnering with the northern alliance in afghanistan many to this day say that is why we allegedly lost bin laden in tora bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the pakistan border general tommy franks says this would not have been possible and i believe him more than the kerry kedwards crowd our ally pakistan would not have tolerated a us presence given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the taliban as for the author s attempts to rid israeli society of prime minister sharon it didn t work he forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the lebanon operation after yasser walked all over clinton in barak in 2000 and launched restarted the intifada israel voted for arik and his platform of not negotiating with arafat sadly no tragically he is haphazardly implementing his disengagement plan six weeks prior to its start it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that israelis are increasingly against it moreover turning land over to terrorist supporting mazen will embolden those that seek israel s destruction israel expects terror gangs of hamas islamic jihad and mazen s own fatah to immediately set up shop in the west bank and begin terror operations so looking back mr schiff and ya ari who was right terror coddling doves such as rabin \( who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting arafat \) and peres or likud hawks such as sharon \( and netanyahu \) let the reader decide i know who i would trust with my security likud members sharon and netanyahu,positive
the island of lost maps is the story of a petty crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the 90s posing as a researcher bland would enter rare book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single edged razor then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting or at least unquestioning dealers before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore he had stolen more than a half million dollars worth of maps island is the first book for author miles harvey in the book he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350 page book he is only partly successful i found the material on bland s crime fascinating however bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime there is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking but as a true crime book it over extends itself it would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused,negative

if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman s self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student,negative

while it s certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination deconstructionism by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is of course inhabited by people who read and people who write this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone,negative

on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms cornwell having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning i simply cannot help but ask myself is she really writing this stuff very slow in the beginning i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly however this novel does begin to pick up momentum but not until the reader is halfway through and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime richmond virginia where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl so scarpetta with marino tagging along of course heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance only to find that her old building is being demolished and that the new one under the leadership of dr joel marcus is sloppy regarding policies and procedures the demoralization of her former staff by dr marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta and clearly he resents her intrusion so why has he asked her to come meanwhile lucy as head of the last precinct is once again up to her ears in nonsense for such a brilliant successful young woman \( as readers have always been lead to believe \) why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee worse than the weak storyline and the fact that this novel is just all over the place is the author s disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african americans throughout drug dealers are black they re dead of gunshot wounds and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man s conspicuously large organ are you kidding me the trash collectors are big dark men and of course in an upscale neighborhood the old black woman must work in one of the houses the author s unbelievably narrow minded stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy read only if you must but frankly there are better ways to spend your time dy,negative

while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book it reminds me of the story the emperor has no clothes yes choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying the flipping back and forth was not accomplished in a smooth flowing manner in addition the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone,negative

two huge problems with this book one this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and traveling and learning when they already know his identity so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass two the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman s other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels this thing drags on in some unnamed nondescript city,negative
for over three years i ve been studying buddhism and zen during that time i ve ordered many books within the different buddhist schools there are many fine authors out there that explain the tenets and fine workings of buddhism as well as zen i believe a solid background in buddhism background is essential in understanding buddha s message to mankind however the true nuts and bolts of buddhism practice can be found most directly in zen it is one thing to know something about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to apply it ezra bayda has most succinctly given the best instruction of how to apply zen to one s life where we need it the most during those moments when we are gripped with our core pain core pain is comprised of our anger traumas sadness feelings of inferiority etc it is this core pain that can make our life a living hell ezra examines these emotions and teaches us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that truly works instead of denying them or trying to escape them we learn that they are part of our path in life and while it takes courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us away from the genuine life we all deserve at least one reader has referred to this as being like a self help book yet anytime we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology aren t we looking for something to help us ezra offers us the tools to achieve transformation in our life when i ordered this book i had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply zen teachings to my life what i didn t realize is that the information this book contains would exceed anything i have read in any religious book psychology book or college text another reviewer said where s the zen in reference to the contents of this book the zen is there on every page while ezra doesn t use the esoteric style of writing common in zen buddhist teaching his simple clearcut way of communication exemplifies the simpleness that zen is truly about ezra s other two books at home in the muddy water and saying yes to life are excellent as well and deepen your understanding of living mindfully and in the moment a helpful hint read his three books in chronological order with this book first personally i think that reading them in order adds to a person s understanding and that each book acts like a foundation for the next ezra bayda i have not had the honor of meeting you personally yet i thank you most sincerely for the gift of your writings i bow to you for you are a master there are many of us i m sure that are looking forward to your future works two other excellent zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with difficult emotions are beginning mindfulness learning the way of awareness by andrew weiss and at hell s gate a soldier s journey by claude anshin thomas also the writing s of thich nhat hanh a great man who highly influenced both of these authors teaches the art of mindful living in a very understandable manner good luck to you on the path,positive

i picked this up because it s considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie then the book must be pretty good not so with howard s end the plot in howard s end doesn t progress much outside of an early death and later marraige you have to have some interest in the characters but they just weren t very believeable none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance the story is clearly dated and doesn t hold up well so many years later living in today s world it s hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry there definately is an audience for this book i m just not a part of it,negative
i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market edain mccoy who has written some wonderful new age material strikes an off putting note in this one the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements in several of her spreads she conveys that a card s placement at a certain point in the spread may or may not mean some karmic element at play the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define therefore when a card may or may not mean something that interpretation could significantly change on whether you may or may not interpret it that way leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card s meaning tarot cards are intuitive not rational and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position may or may not be the root of the issue these spreads speak very clearly to the author but not so to the reader i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives but the explanations are too ambiguous,negative

ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300 page book and so does author valerie hemingway s story for that reason this book merits only two stars early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19 valerie is aware of the author s magnetic and dominant personality around him everything came to life there was an urgency and vitality that did not ebb when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway this is an endearing look at the older struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of a moveable feast but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject as a result her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a e hotchner s papa hemingway the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain paris key west cuba and america share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway s strange son gregory \( apparently the other bull referred to in the title \) it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway even in death and over 40 years later that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man,negative
as china re emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world oddly the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao s disastrous reign even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge heavily populated and \( from a western perspective \) oftentimes strange land aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country on a recent trip to china i was highly impressed by the deep generosity humility resourcefulness strength perseverance and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith this spirit is also i believe one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese also those who are concerned that a christian china would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way,positive
in his recently published history the whiskey rebellion william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn he has an axe to grind and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion the argument is that because hamilton s patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen s resistance and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion the problem with hogeland s argument is his scholarship or lack there of he almost never offers a direct quote especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance instead hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote the reader is expected to accept on faith the author s interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end not all of this is hogeland s fault the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop even doris kearns goodwin a legitimate scholar is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze ultimately this is the main problem with william hogeland he is not a scholar he is a magazine writer with an agenda and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history because there is no basis in reality,negative
this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous lies my teacher told me could have been an amazing book but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor the only reason i didn t give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good but the book as a whole is just far too biased,negative
this book gives the reader a fascinating and personal look inside not just the foster care system but why they are very much so needed young dave s life was very likely saved by being taken from his mother s home and placed into foster care but this book makes it clear that despite this positive change in is life it certainly didn t mean everything was happily ever after dave then struggled with issues ranging from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years olds know by that age ranging from as simple as how to take a proper bath to how to behave with proper manners it also gives you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes and parents go through they deal day in and day out with children coming from troubled homes and these foster homes are in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim i think many of us myself included are unaware of just what a struggle it is for both the foster children and the foster parents as well as how much we need to support these people they are dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause thanks again dave for having the courage to share your beautiful story of heartache and triumph with us,positive

whether you re planning to read through crowley s book of thoth for the first time or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it this book is going to be equally useless to you several of crowley s diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly but sadly that s the only good thing about this book the book is filled with a lot of fluff duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley s and harris lives and constantly excuses and defends crowley s character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley s works so perhaps its some sort of atonement but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley s character through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid unfortunately duquette doesn t do this his background information is base and scarce he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this duquette doesn t give nearly enough information to understand crowley s works and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley s work duquette outright fails at times it seems as if duquette doesn t even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck i don t think the man even understands tarot in general \( and duquette s own tarot deck is evidence of this too \) at his best duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette s work a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level reading through the book of thoth there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better crowley s phonetic translation of the i ching doesn t follow the current standard and sometimes the differences are confusing especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching a key showing crowley s translation and the standard translation would ve been helpful likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth and what he did write is hard to find a chapter explaining crowley s views on astrology would ve been great if that wasn t possible then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful however duquette s solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read duquette s book isn t useful as a reference to crowley s work duquette doesn t seem to understand crowley most of the time and fails to adequatley explain crowley s ideas besides some new agey nonsense like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays duquette doesn t offer any new ideas or insights into crowley s work except for a few nice diagrams \( which are common enough and easy to find \) there isn t anything worthwhile contained in this book at least not anything you won t get out of reading crowley s book of thoth,negative

i respect the message of the unexpected legacy of divorce but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce unexpected those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time they fell apart due to abuse infidelity and just plain incompatibility what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority who constantly disappoints hurts and replaces the kids there will be damage no getting away from it however is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids seemingly with the other parent s approval i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married this is a major flaw in the research i didn t see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference i don t think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid s whether it s divorce or starting a new life afterward kids will suffer i don t like studies like this they re misleading and potentially damaging,negative

this book was so simplistic i was quite disappointed you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all a worthy goal but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit he really held back from delving into any dark territory his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit he always managed to put a happy positive spin on everything which is nice but life isn t that simple,negative

i had no prior experience with music playing \( other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica \) and yet i found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn from it smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing starting with one hand playing but quickly to two hands then chords etc and ending with sharp and flat notes it is well organized has well thought out exercises advices and a diverse collection of \( short \) attractive tunes of increasing complexity \( from jingle bells to waltzing matilda to silent night to green sleeves to we shall overcome to minuet in g minor \) i prefer it to other teach yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills such as the complete piano player or piano for dummies i particularly like that it gets to two hand playing almost right away which i feel is better preparation even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially it may have helped \( coordination wise \) that i have been typing for 20 years with both hands if you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way then i recommend this book if you perfer a slower pace then maybe look elsewhere for me this was the perfect book to learn from,positive

this is a wonderful book aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the all too often misunderstood post partum depression symptoms while i am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others i urge brooke shields to re consider a comment she made recently she indicated that while she knows now that post partum depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support she does not believe that adhd exists nor that it requires the same level of support it is essential that such public figures realize that what they have experienced is not the only form of reality thousands suffer with adhd in ways that interfere with their livlihood schooling relationships and self esteem issues studies have shown this challenge to be as real and as debilitating as post partum depression so please brooke don t deny the realities of other maladies simply because you haven t experienced them you of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others your voice is heard loudly your message must be correct thank you,positive

when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy and truthfully it s not a horrible book it is entertaining the style works etc on that note if you re looking for a fun read and don t plan on thinking about it too much then by all means get it my problem with the book is that it doesn t deserve all the acclaim it s getting if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio political situation of america this is not your book probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it s heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female packer has very little new to say and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers but have also have been said better by those authors drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you can t keep a good woman down a book that while having its own problems would probably be a better use of your time and money if you re really interested in the social commentary in the text even from the literary standpoint it s not terribly outstanding the characters are stereotypes the plots are predictable the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person an intelligent outsider who struggles with race religion and fitting in and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so the other protagonists are the same just not so irritable similar to this lack of variation in her characters packer varies little in her narrative style yes the language is pretty at times but there is no experimentation with language or structure all of the writing is in a highly generic voice finally the stories themselves contain scenes that aren t necessary and that detract from the actual narrative in short drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn t actual talent but how much your publisher backs you packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out,negative
the sub title of this book is very misleading it does not contain an action oriented approach to raising your self esteem unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page \( one of the things i dislike about myself is one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is \) and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper and there are a lot of them so be prepared to go through a lot of paper sure completing sentences technically counts as an action but if you re like me action oriented implies some sort of cognitive behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy but alas the practice helped me in no way your mileage may vary but i wouldn t recommend this book to anyone,negative

gerd ludemann writes historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead we must acknowledge a worldwide historical hoax \( 190 \) a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support three streams of thought permeate the resurrection of christ gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish invent or explain away peter and paul experienced hallucination and vision experiences proceeding from self deception belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter christian polemic in his chapter translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles purpose and tradition reworked \( re gospel writers \) and historical elements in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic or perhaps \( he intimates \) to cover up some element of embarrassment for example ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council \( which condemned jesus \) but that mark \( earliest gospel \) likely invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus but ludemann needs to discredit such notions for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb ludemann s case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances ludemann gets carried away with himself when he in tabloid fashion suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to disinfect a tradition of a dishonorable burial of jesus this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew mark and luke of being anti jewish \( refer to the ridiculous appendix 3 \) is christianity a history of self deception ludemann invests in the rather high risk prospect of hallucination for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus multiple appearances even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text \( vs 3 5 \) to the early 30 s ad the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection three physical events also the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination as well as being hugged ludemann though convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions introduces hallucination what accounts for these hallucinations peter s vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning \( 165 \) paul s event had a character of light and like the vision of john happened in the spirit i e in ecstasy \( 47 \) but paul does not report i was in the spirit as john does \( see revelation 1 \) john is deliberately conveying a non physical experience paul is not when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual in the spirit experience he does so in terms appropriate to that experience \( 2 corinthians 12 2 \) so we have record of paul s ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages modern depth psychology to explain paul s conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to apostle in chief of a new program of salvation \( 170 171 \) so we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul s subconscious state than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death burial empty tomb and appearances ludemann s examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural historians look for the best explanation of the evidence yet ludemann writes who decides at what point of historical study a theological explanation ought to begin \( 201 \) this is rife with misunderstanding one need only confirm that an event occurred in history regardless of theological implications also simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism \( thus supernaturalism \) is an entirely logical proposition yet ludemann quotes another author the disciples believed in phantoms imagined that they were surrounded by miracles took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time \( 175 \) this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection we should abandon christianity sadly he reaches the wrong conclusion self deluded by a proliferation of one can imagine seems to indicate likely enough and one thus suspects reasoning ludemann boasts accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision \( 210 \) may the reader decide

i loved the core knowledge curriculum the reason i switched my children to a charter school is that they started out teaching ck i also switched them back to the public school when the principal got away from ck and made it just like a public school i agree that a teacher should supplement what is in the ck books to give their students a better understanding of the material teaching the information exactly how it is presented in the books would be very dry however ck is a great outline of what should be taught it covers a tremendous amount of knowledge including the fight for civil rights all religious ideology multicultural literature and more if there is a problem with the books it is that many children would not be motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered for many it would be too much also weak teachers would be overwhelmed trying to cover everything hence anyone claiming that ck supports a racist philosophy has never read the books also i want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist misspelled the word it is not spelled rasist i also find it disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher when attending school maybe that teacher would have benefited from a core knowledge foundation,positive
my blood was boiling as i read other customers rave reviews of the prince of tides whoever considers this thesaurus scrubbing self indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature someone was even audacious enough to compare pat conroy to virginia woolf what a joke woolf s writing is brilliant original and real she cuts to the quick whereas conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions one can almost see conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is nor how unrealistic it makes the story i laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters mouths in the real world nobody is as self concious and self reflexive as the characters in this book they do not speak in reams of figurative language i cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are especially the children also conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them \( i make that claim as a southerner who lived in nyc for four years \) it s one of many many flaws in this ridiculous book read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal \( john irving etc \) but avoid it if you have any respect for the english language and for real american literature \( cheever plath hemingway cather etc \) don t be fooled by all the fools out there,negative
reviewed by joanne benham for reader views \( 2 06 \) it s an ordinary sunday afternoon for odelia grey an afternoon spent with her dysfunctional family means a stop at the grocery store on the way home to buy her favorite comfort food stouffer s macaroni and cheese to get the taste of her family \( and her rotten date on saturday night \) out of her mouth and then she gets the phone call her dear friend sophie a staunch supporter mentor and banner carrier for bbw big beautiful women has committed suicide as she struggles to cope with this heartbreaking news she has more disturbing news piled on not only did sophie commit suicide she did it in front of dozens of eyewitnesses on her adult website with the emergence of more hidden facets of sophie s life odelia finds it difficult to reconcile this new sophie to the sophie she knew and loved as odelia digs deeper into sophie s life both past and present she comes to the conclusion that sophie would not under any circumstances kill herself with backup help from a memorable cast of characters odelia sets out to clear her friend s name and in the process gains a new acceptance of herself as a fat woman in a thin society this book was enjoyable on so many levels first and foremost it is very well written second it confronts the prejudice that is openly shown to fat people in today s society and gives a gentle nudge toward developing tolerance and finally it leaves you impatiently awaiting the next installment in the life of odelia patience grey the best new heroine to spring from the pages of a book in years,positive
having read detective comics 471 479 in the 70s done by this same creative team i picked this up hoping for more of the same what a let down i have to ask what happened the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest most detailed art i d ever seen in a comic book i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin when he was working on x men he gave john bryne s pencils that fine detail as well has austin done a gil kane and given up his nib and ink to work with marker pen this dark detective series shows none of the fine ness of his previous work you only have to compare the flash backs of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong maybe austin or rogers are getting older but the artwork is very basic and lacks the sheen they used to produce the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane s early work the story also is a little unbelievable it portrays bruce as a love sick puppy and just doesn t ring true also the lettering is well it s been hand done by rogers i surmise and is quite uneven it should have been done by computer i m sorry i so wanted to like this but it s nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s,negative
i have read several of hiaasen s books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did,negative
while this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses i cannot recommend it to other readers the author unfortunately perpetuates the right wing republican only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical christianity she battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel indeed in reading some of the chapters it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a christian worldview that might veer in any part from republican platform positions this is really too bad because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions i would not have begrudged her political point of view at all had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position,negative

a singularly dull book the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung a south victorious with modern weapons seemed too trivial the author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not the character of robert e lee in the book is just too too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts i finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that i put it down halfway through i am not sure if it turns out the way i think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other,negative
am i the only one who didn t get a complete book at first i noticed there was some poor editing lots of typos but then after page 180 where page 181 should be \( sleep chapter \) it goes back to page 117 \( discipline chapter that i already read \) it continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 \( a whole 63 pages duplicated \) then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the school days chapter that i don t have the beginning of i m completely missing pages 181 245 \( 67 pages \) other than that good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas,negative

of all of willard s books this one was my favorite willard offers a systematic study of the nature of being and then proposes a pragmatic approach to setting the hear back on course to purity and submission to god a human being he says \( p 30 \) is composed of thought feeling choice body social context and soul he states plainly \( p 41 \) it is the central point of this book that spiritual transformation only happens as each essential dimension of the human being is transformed to christlikeness under the direction of a regenerate will interacting with the constant overtures of grace from god such transformation is not the result of mere human effort and cannot be accomplished by putting pressure on the will \( heart spirit \) alone fundamental to this project is first dying to self taking up the cross and living in self denial \( chapter 4 \) we must then go through a process like learning a new language the general steps he summarizes in the acronym vim vision intention means \( p 85 \) these are a vision for kingdom life the will to do it and the means to carry it out the rest of the book is structured around a look at the transformation of the mind \( chapters 6 7 \) will \( 8 \) body \( 9 \) social context \( 10 \) and the soul \( 11 \) the work of the mind involves being cognizant of the ideas and feelings that drive our society and our personal lives instead we should be renewed with love joy and peace in the inner life the work of the will involves surrendering our will to god s and then moving from abandonment to contentment here the spiritual disciplines bring to light our duplicity on these matters the work of the body means realizing the over emphasis we place on it and the need to cease idolizing and misusing our bodies the work of our social context involves noting the use of assault and withdrawal that characterizes our relationships \( p 181 \) lastly the work of the soul which willard defines as the unifying factor of them all is best summarized in psalm 1 we are to be renewed into new beings who happily fulfill the law of god again i said this was my favorite of willard s works i m not sure any of the rest of them so thoroughly transcend from the theological to the practical without missing a step the systematic study of human nature is all inclusive he lays out a blueprint of a kingdom vision of what the human being \( emphasis on being \) is the very nature of humanity from the state in which we find it to the place it is supposed to be is spelled out here the enormity of the work is amazing for such a readable text,positive
art is a young man fresh out of college and has a curious set of friends arthur an attractive gay man the enigmatic phlox with whom arthur works and the distinctly odd hedonist cleveland art is uncertain of his sexuality being torn between arthur and phlox cleveland is a threat to the stability of anyone with whom he comes into contact the mysteries of pittsburgh was a well received yet while at times i found it entertaining and witty in truth it s a very bumpy piece of work in which the characters don t really convince the plot is unconvincing from the first and descends into absurdity towards the end in summary it reads very much as a first effort perhaps an experiment but i found it baffling that anyone could consider it a mature piece of prose g rodgers,negative
yuck this book was totally boring well maybe you ll like it if you re like 7 or 8 years old or something not only is it totally boring but poorly written which surprised me because ann m martin is certainly not a bad writer i m really glad she left the bsc and started writing a new series about them the bsc books are soo boring and childish please a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds don t waste your time reading the bsc books they are all pretty dumb,negative

i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years i was born raised in the north i think evans should rename his book fiddler on the roof in the south his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history as it was in the past here it s very much the southern jews were all so happy they all fit in and were accepted etc he does cite a few instances where they had problems but these usually involved us yankee jews like the instances when a few \( yankee \) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights evans should realize that times have really changed here the evangelical christians in my town \( which is most people here \) harrass me like crazy i am praying for you have you read the words of jesus who was a jew like you when will you come to my church blah blah blah thank god for the minority of catholics methodists presbyterians and a few others who live here they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am and the way i will stay a jew i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences and that they cannot relate to what i am saying but i do want to ask evans a few questions 1 \) if things are so great for the jews in the south why have you lived in new york for decades now 2 \) why don t you at least write either a new forward to the book a magazine article etc contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time \( for some of us at least \) primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians i read evans books before i moved here and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here for a jew who really cares about her his religion living here is depressing it is practically jew less and at best the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me \( by the way i am planning to move to a city \) by the way don t bother writing to me to tell me that i am wrong or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church believe me with all the praying for me that is going on in this town and all the myriad attempts to convert me if it hasn t happened by now as they say in these parts it just ain t gonna happen,negative
i bought this book just recently and was really touched \( and cried \) by the whole experience that gus had went through he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance \( stephanie \) and without her he could ve been out there on the street again overall it s a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another this book is a genuine prove,positive
i think that the beginning of the book was the worst part he started by telling us that he was leaving and wasn t going to tell anyone he didn t even say goodbye to a lady friend so he tells us that he s leaving and then he goes back into the past back when he was a little kid he tells about different experiances how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years he tells about all the troubles that his family went through the end was the best part i usually hate the endings but this one was good this bool is meant for older people who like english books or is it ireland i think it was set in irelan,positive
carson mccullers one of america s greatest southern writers was often misunderstood as many people were put off by or unwilling to deal with her \( at the time \) controversial subject matter mccullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience the loneliness and isolation of her gothic like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have though magnified and intensified to the nth degree tennessee williams in his introduction to mccullers reflections in a golden eye posed the question \( in a mock dialogue \) most people asked about writers of the gothic school such as carson mccullers flannery o connor katherine anne porter and eudora welty why do they write about such dreadful things williams replies in my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society why have they got to use symbols of the grotesque and the violent because a book is short and a man s life is long the awfulness has to be compressed mccullers unlike any writer i have ever read pierces the heart of themes such as love isolation and loneliness with her lucid poetic prose tennessee williams in virginia spencer carr s biography of mccullers summed up mccullers writing as follows i have used the word heart but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of carson mccullers genius i believe in fact i know that there are many many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it and therefore carson mccullers is what i would call a necessary writer she owned the heart and the deep understanding of it but in addition she had that tongue of angels that gave her power to sing of it to make of it an anthem,positive

a commentary on a book of the bible will generally include the commentator s outline of the structure of that book a good outline can greatly enhance one s understanding of a biblical book so such outlines are important rarely though do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived this book which is based on professor lee s doctoral dissertation describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text this method called conceptual analysis is a modern version of form criticism developed by lee s advisor rolf knierim lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes one then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text finally the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed lee demonstrates the method on num 10 11 36 13 a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways he divides this section into 36 units discussing with each one the rationale for his choices he then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is num 13 1 14 45 the account of the exploration of the promised land by 12 scouts the largely negative report the scouts present to the people and israel s subsequent rejection of god s plan to bring them into the promised land the pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a scientific process with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text there is no way to completely mechanize such a process however some subjectivity is inevitable and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others in my opinion one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text by this criterion i believe that lee s outline of num 10 11 36 13 earns high marks his outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text as he explains in the latter stages of the book it is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists this book is a notable exception and i enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of numbers,positive
this series may be good for a laugh some of the writing is engaging but the premise is absurd why in this day and age should anyone accept the world view of the bible a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe s beliefs and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt sinai in a sense bible believers have been left behind since the 1700s enlightenment tom paine s the age of reason showed the god of the bible to be a cruel vindictive monster and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations the ravings of a madman read this series if you like enjoy parts of it but make no mistake to take any of this seriously you have to regress to a prehistoric world view before men learned to think to ask questions before logic or science a time when dazed superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth if they didn t grovel humbly enough to their supposed god do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one when the sheep are raptured up to heaven their clothes are left behind so heaven is a nudist colony the basic contradiction of course lies in using worldly action \( some of it exciting \) to proselytize for the unworldly the supernatural but why should we care whether any of the good guys gets killed and why should they mind won t they go straight up to heaven that s what they want isn t it why even lift a finger against the bad guys didn t christ say resist not evil worried about who will win god is infinitely powerful so jesus \( who is 1 3 of god or something like that \) is sure to win when armageddon rolls around in book 12 of the series and the sheep the believers will happily worship him looking just like the pictures of dim witted bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah s witnesses leave at your door the going price for a used copy of tribulation force is one cent does that tell you something actually the story telling is worth more the basic premise is worth less perhaps it averages out,negative
this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments although they were right about the obscurity this book still taught me alot you don t necessarily need it but if you want to be prepared this book will not hurt your bank account that much i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature \( 5 stars check out the reviews \) and the internet that is all you need,negative
i am ashamed to say i read this entire book i kept hoping it would get better but it didn t it is filled with typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics clarkson actually spells mel gibson s name wrong several times throughout the book and refers to lethal weapon director richard donner as dormer for several pages he jumps back and forth from one movie production to another making it difficult to follow lastly he relies on the accounts of people who had met mel gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional conflict with him in the retelling of these conflicts and what went down we hear one point of view only and generally that is the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment towards gibson so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy the best part of the book is the end for two reasons clarkson finally gets to gibson s most recent project the passion of the christ the subtitle and the picture on the back of the book gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the book but after 300 pages of reading i was still waiting for the subject to come up i have to say i felt that this was the only well written part of the whole book thoughtful and interesting the second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it was finally over i m sorry to be so blunt but i can t help it i highly recommend reading the book about the making of the passion of the christ you can learn a lot about gibson there but i cannot recommend this biography,negative

polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant radical and all too plausible theory in this book going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about polanyi s answer will not be pleasing to libertarians he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention and must be sustained through further intervention he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations usually economic relations were a result of social relations under the market it is the latter polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain his argument that government enclosures created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing however other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments polanyi s argument that there was no rent seeking \( he doesn t use that term \) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy \( proving that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect one 19th century investigators conclusions don t serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi doesn t do too much to back up his arguments he fortunately has a section called notes and sources where he lists his research material but i d wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later,positive

luc ferry raises some very important and pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an authoritarian social structure does deep ecology demand a level of political correctness which places its premises beyond question ferry is not the first to raise these questions the institute for social ecology led by murray bookchin has made the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter of course there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology but they do not make up the whole story particularly glaring is ferry s one sided depiction of eco feminism in fact some eco feminist work in the u s has been particularly sharp at questioning the orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism the questions which occupy ferry should be asked by every person who is involved in radical ecology and many of his criticisms are on target for a specific body of work but he doesn t bother to see the whole picture and readers should be careful to read beyond the quotes cited by ferry and to study deep ecology and ecofeminism on their own terms,positive
perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in english \( or at least it appears to have been there is no translator listed \) but this is by far the most lucid thing i ve read by latour in a way it s a radical break he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child actor network theory stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work,positive
eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work \( osd \) and academia \( naval war college and harvard \) i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well grounded work i was disappointed i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work the churchill chapter was the best cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done thought not rally tied to the focus of the book i learned the most from the ben gurion since i knew the least about him the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest,negative

seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that james frey fiasco anybody who now pens their auto bios have to first be as famous and beloved as billy crystal but then they can only put out the cotton candy coney island fluff as 700 sundays is granted the book is based on crystal s highly praised tony award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al but it s nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and or tide one over during the day and night kaddish yet in ripping a page out of billy s book it s not hard to imagine how that rapid fire exchange between him and his agent went it probably went something like hey bubby how about writing a book talking about your 700 sundays with your pop well i m not a writer per se i just jot down a few notes here and there and then go out and perform the material on stage so here s a few blank pages of paper write down what you have it ll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most and it sounds and looks much better than it reads don t worry bubby i know people who know people who you get the idea at the publishers here s their recipe they ll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread em

lot of white space toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album slap it all together between two hardcovers it ll be just fine yes but don t worry consider it like a vintage bottle of mogen david 20 20 wine aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout in this case the local bookstores oh and make sure you give em just enough to whet their taste buds leave em wanting more and thirsty for more people ll drink it up yes but don t worry face everybody loves ya just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about satchmo and

for it but that s what authors do they dig deep but you already knew that right can you dig it man i knew that you could yes but don t worry face everybody loves ya your books don t have to be earth shattering or thought provoking or anything like that but hey listen with a book deal a books on tape deal and who knows even a movie deal we ll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets mark my words we will and say since you haven t had a hit movie in awhile no offense we re going to get martin scorsese to produce and direct your life story yes it ll be something like pinch me i m still

this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front across the region known as flanders three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling bombing machine gun fire gas attacks and wretched weather conditions in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down it is a shame so many historians including such military writers as david glantz do not emulate groom s style,positive
amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization the corporation look moral only someone like al capone could sympathize with this group on the oregon how can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the oregon the us apparently is willing to finance the group but the us also financed sadam noriega unfortunately in this sense it is too much like real american policy which absolutely disgusts me \( the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind as long as they are not righteous americans \) the characters are clich there is no suspense since everything goes as planned and anyone in the crew can just about do anything including being a successful rock band it makes me look back on the dirk pitt books and wonder about dirk s morality,negative
i worked with the author in the narcotics section of the chicago police department please do not let the author s perception of the truth sway your opinion about the chicago police department and the men and women who serve proudly the author claims that the narcotics section and its policies were a leading contributor to his decline i think not he thrived on these practices and used them to his advantage all we saw was a selfish and immature young man who thought of himself first if the author thinks that only the commander of the narcotics section was disgusted with his drug usage and failing his urinalysis he is dead wrong we all were if you read this book please do not indict all of us because of one person s jaded stories,negative
for the english language reader wedgwood s book which has been in print for over sixty years is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of european history it gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations the principal antagonists at the outset ferdinand ii of austria and frederick v elector palatine the condottieri style generals spinola von mansfeld tilly wallenstein piccolomini christian of halberstadt bernhard of saxe weimar the duc d enghien \( conde \) the contentious minor rulers maximilian v of bavaria johann georg of saxony the northern monarchs christian iv of denmark and gustavus adophus of sweden \( and his daughter christina and prime minister oxenstierna \) the spoiler cardinal richelieu the new emperor ferdinand iii and his cousin the warlord cardinal infant ferdinand of spain and many others this book is written in a traditional english historian s prose style that is clear eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories while still covering these aspects of the period in spite of some reviewers claims of a protestant bias in her interpretation the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long running disaster of the war taking the position that it was the self serving political interests of the participants \( dynasties rulers generals and paymasters \) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of germany and bohemia although i am not familiar with this new edition \( and grafton s introduction \) i emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the holy roman empire during the sixteenth century with a special emphasis on the composition of the bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the habsburg king emperors the extent and internal organization of the bohemian crown lands should also be outlined a succinct review of the political status of lutheranism calvinism the bohemian brethren and other protestant confessions throughout all of europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in setting the stage for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious denomination consequences of the war the author supplies sufficient details on the major battles but this is not a work of military history as wedgwood knows battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences and it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war \( including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes \) that wedgwood excels in her analysis of the general european situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events each was a source of conflict and each might cross cut the others complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved in brief the forces were \( a \) religion with three major competing factions \( catholic lutheran calvinist she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the roman catholic church \) \( b \) nationalism \( french german czech etc \) which was a new force on the scene crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality \( which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language \) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests \( c \) monarchic constitutional issues which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the constitutional grouping of major and minor powers known as the holy roman empire \( hre \) the constitutional problem was twofold within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout europe \( duchies counties free city areas ruled by town councils and mayors \) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers powers and privileges were taking place aristocrats oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies \( estates \) reluctant to cede their own powers \( taxation the organization of military service \) to a central authority the same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the hly roman epire that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected emperor \( who had been a habsburg for several centuries \) and the smaller rulerships of central europe the religious reforms rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio eius religio \( whoever rules his religion is the religion of the ruled area \) in the year of the war s inception 1618 this new balance was very fragile comprising four catholic and three protestant imperial electors in germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the emperor \( resident in vienna or prague \) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals especially the protestant electors had been somewhat codified by the augsburg treaty of 1555 and were known as the german liberties these would prove to be especially important to the three protestant electors at the outset of the war in the developing continental war one could be pro or anti habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them for example a catholic ruler \( including the papacy \) might seek protestant allies in order to combat habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the empire which affected his position adversely or a protestant power might accept the habsburg program in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage \( this characterization is apt for saxony and brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war \) as wedgwood notes all three considerations \( religion nationality constitutional relations \) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions from the point of view of rationality or predictability political choices and commitments were often self contradictory \( e g a catholic power supporting a protestant venture a german liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power etc \) or temporary expedients that made the overall european situation more chaotic the war began locally in bohemia but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as spain and england \( even farther to the caribbean naval theater \) as far north as sweden and northeast to poland as far south as italy and southeast as transylvania in other words it was a european continental war with global impact when the war broke out in 1618 it was over the habsburg violation of a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom in bohemia \( the concessions stated in rudolf ii s letter of majesty \) and here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role ferdinand ii who had knowingly violated the terms of the letter soon after being selected by the bohemian diet as king \( and therefore the first in precedence of the hre electors \) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the habsburg dynasty in bohemia and elsewhere he was firmly committed to the goals of the catholic counter reformation \( i e re catholicizing all of the areas within the hre which had become protestant during the last one hundred years \) when he was deposed by a special convention of the bohemian estates \( the defenestration of his deputies in prague being the signal event of this deposition \) the crown of bohemia was offered to the elector of the \( rhineland \) palatinate frederick v who considered himself a champion of the protestant cause the religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war given the other major conflict hovering in the background the spanish habsburg determination to recover the now protestant area of the netherlands which had become the successful and defiant \( dutch \) united provinces the war soon became international while the entry of france and then denmark followed by sweden into the war during the 1620 s changed its nature and extended its duration wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two protestant electors johann georg of saxony and georg wilhelm of brandenburg and one catholic ruler maximilian of bavaria it is her contention throughout the book that johann georg and maximilian in particular could have prevented the war s spread and forced ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand despite their religious differences these two were always strong german liberties proponents and each had the same view of the austrian habsburg rulers they should be kept for the broader protections they offered but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers in the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals \( saxony switched sides and joined the swedes for several years while maximilian s position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies the french as their potential foot in the habsburg camp \) wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of germany wedgwood s gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great power politics and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists her summary of the changes emphasizes the following \( a \) religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war religion was becoming more interiorized and private and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science \( this was the era of galileo and kepler with descartes harvey hook newton huygens etc on the near horizon a time of laboratory science and scientific societies \) as the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about \( b \) for thinking men nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action this was very obvious in france but even true of ferdinand iii for whom the new main cause was the construction of an austrian based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the holy roman imperial protector of far flung german catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile in the minds of both germans and austrian habsburgs the holy roman empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in germany the elbe north german pomeranian ideal empire of wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program austria began to move south and east \( toward italy croatia and hungary \) in its expansionist aims \( c \) the control of immense polyglot multi religious mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent mobile states unto themselves cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad they changed sides the most successful mercenary generals had become mini sovereigns officers were all out for themselves and for their troops \( rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster \) since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement the most famous commanders ernst von mansfeld wallenstein bernhard of saxe weimar the swedish general wrangel all expected \( and some received \) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service the national armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem the pace of the war wound down during its last five years \( although there were several major battles fought even then \) which was a period of extended negotiatons in m nster and osnabr ck with the final treaty being signed late in 1648 for the next five years a series of conferences met at n rnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies many of the loans of this period which were raised to cover the demobilization costs were not paid off for a century individual rulers such as charles of lorraine and the duke of savoy \( who got nothing from the treaty \) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years but the war did not break out again france and spain continued at war with each other but not in germany numerous soldiers especially officers went into mercenary service all over europe others took to the hills as professional bandits for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of germany and bohemia in armed caravans wedgwood accepts the more recent \( 1900 1930 s \) historical estimate that the population of the imperial german lands \( excluding alsace and the netherlands \) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648 the number of dislocated people was also substantial while she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other infrastructural and economic losses were very large she feels that all contemporary sources \( e g the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years \) exaggerated local losses since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution the free peasantry benefited briefly since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates prices fell while wages rose for a number of years which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans but within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with imperial royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re create bonded serf like conditions for peasants town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants \( e g prohibitions against mobility domestic industry and household craft production a trend which later historians refer to as neo serfdom \) class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started there was a new large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court backed military and bureaucratic appointments at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers germany and the austrian based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing atlantic trade for a number of years the outlets of germany s major rivers \( rhine elbe oder and for brandenburg prussia vistula \) were controlled by foreign powers reducing germany s commercial strength hamburg was the exception becoming the major maritime merchant city of the north sea coast at the expense of the other hanseatic cities and the scandinavian powers the only medium sized german state to emerge with positive prospects was brandenburg soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful prussia the peace while ending the wars of religion set the stage for a long series of nationalistic wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict france replaced the habsburg spanish austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace austria turned to the south and east and spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater there was no politically or culturally unified germany within the boundaries of the old empire \( french culture began to reign supreme \) and the cosmopolitanism \( its openness to outside influences \) of this area during the 18th century instead of being a source of pride over its achievements became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived german nationalism author s judgment and conclusions in terms of responsibility for the overall disaster wedgwood points to the futility and self destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of ferdinand ii and the elector palatine but from the point of view of failures of practical \( and ethical \) politics she highlights the behavior of maximilian and johann georg who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a unified german program which would have forced imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it between these two she sees the saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances \( pressed by the swedish juggernaut \) and therefore less culpable for the mess while she judges the bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow germans thus identifying him as the more culpable beautiful in its style and concision wedgwood s final summary is also gloomy \( as one might expect of a work completed in 1939 on the verge of world war ii \) as there was no compulsion towards a conflict which in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame so no right was vindicated by its ragged end the war solved no problem its effects both immediate and indirect were either negative or disastrous morally subversive economically destructive socially degrading confused in its causes devious in its course futile in its result it is the outstanding example in european history of meaningless conflict,positive
i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times i got to around page 20 or so i ll probably try again however if you re an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you ll know what objectivism is about i wouldn t suggest it for teens that haven t had any prior readings though objectivism is about the self and about reason and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous i assume that s in my head but judge for yourself her caricatures of the witch doctor \( who controls others from a spiritual perspective \) and attila \( who controls by brute force \) are actually interesting wrong but interesting since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival \( or think they do anyway \) it s rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand \( she s not wrong on everything \) or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills judging by previous reviews it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers if you buy into it you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo intellectual way if you don t buy into it however you re evil \( either the witch doctor or attila \) and probably just too stupid to get it why i didn t finish it yet i just couldn t get past her ignorance of history frankly if you re writing a work of fiction the historical innacuracies don t matter but this isn t supposed to be fiction i like history and most people don t so it probably won t bother most people also while she denounces religion ms rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself like all other religions and cults the world is messed up basically because people don t think like she does,negative

at first i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story especially since i work as a mental health professional as i keep reading i discovered that it wasn t sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child and of the intrusive nature of the media i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict despite her past history of nervous breakdown and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man the secondary characters were all wonderful in particular mariah s mother and the lawyers on both side i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story as with all picoult books this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn t easily breezed through but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read,positive

if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u s as kurlansky attempts in this book the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year the reader is owed specifics yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent but prohibited it chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government however flawed resulting from open debate a bigger difference could hardly be imagined but kurlansky does see striking differences albeit only in the post 1968 world the soviet bloc began it s decent to oblivion while the capitalist west avoided the same his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean though what manner of revolution he envisions is never rendered to specifics likely for good reason but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do,negative

from what i gather edward abbey has somewhat of a cult following i had never read anything by the guy never even heard of him before i got this book i just thought i should point that out before going on this book kept me reading no doubt about that it has it s downsides but overall i d reccomend it not hey you gotta read this right now but it s good if you re looking for something a little different this book kind of made me think i m not the kind of guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every aspect of it but i couldn t help it with this story i thought a lot of it was psychological dealing with the main character his thoughts attitudes and what made him tick this is a fairly long book but the actual story of the guy going back to his hometown is short the plot alternates every chapter one about where he presently is and then a memory then where he is then another memory and so on although it was an interesting way to write the book i thought some of the memory sequences dragged a bit but don t get me wrong overall i did enjoy them if you re looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of thoughts about life this is a good bookt to pick up,positive

having read a few bosch books already \( the closers and lost light \) i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series however i was very disappointed with this book one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors \( mispellings and such \) i found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages \( before i stopped reading \) i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book also i found the book to be too gritty it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order connelly s writing seems to be getting better and better which should explain why i didn t enjoy this book and couldn t finish it i gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order,negative
this book does what it says it lists low or no cost campgrounds they may not be where you want to go or fit your mega motorhome that s what commercial parks are for i don t know if it is all inclusive but it certainly has most of the campgrounds that i know of in areas in which i am familiar,positive
the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948 i am not questioning mosley s portrayal of racism however i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948 and the answer is not very there may have been poverty racism alcholism but l a county seemed pretty safe the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find 1827 mosley may have been more familiar with l a of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way throw in speakeasies gangsters hijacking liquor trucks and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928 i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate but many many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life era place that had not been shown before from what i can tell he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s \( i guess those years average to be about 1948 \) mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation however i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic and i hope readers realize that it is not easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak but unfortunately large group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect that is interesting to read detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via confession easy does solve one of the murders on his own but just about everything he solves is simply confessed to him i find that extremely dissatisfying mosley has packed the book with violence but seems to know very little about violence himself none of the fights are well described easy for being a self professed killing machine can t actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them they are either big or they are small he does not come of as being hard boiled but rather a pathetic braggart mosley does show signs of being a very good writer but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional i imagine that his work must have improved but this effort is nothing to get exceited over and again i don t obsess over accuracy but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel,negative
cruel horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot the abuse of children evil ranger poising as a dead ranger freaky religious sect dead animals on the bed and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me i ve read many barr books and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters it s hard to keep them straight in this book that was the last of my worries i didn t even finish it i was so turned off,negative

normally i like the entire female power thing but frankly the this is wrong or evil part of that storyline is really old in an era where girls do try out for and get placed on boys teams these issues seem outdated likewise rules were recently changed in indiana \( not even slightly a liberal state \) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender i know this book is from 1999 but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening changes are happening overall i felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her magic is empowered through a pageant and her cooking how much more gender role enforcement can we have really with a strong female lead shouldn t a buffy universe story do better than this in general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding,negative

i have been slogging through this book for weeks now it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich s excellent book on byzantium the book lacks any narrative thrust often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author s obvious agenda to set the record straight and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its barbaric european contemporaries,negative
while previous guides for the serial drama lost have often left something to be desired the book finding lost the unofficial guide more than makes up for it nikki stafford s attention to detail \( and believe me all lost fans should have a great attention to detail \) is thus far unparalleled in any other guide book you name it this guide book has it in addition to the usual episode synopsis stafford provides readers with all the information they can handle including keeping track of the appearances of the numbers discussing theories pointing out bloopers and continuity errors illuminating connections and just generally proving that she has watched way more lost than any of us in addition to all that stafford gives the low down on each of the lost cast members before they became losties even if you have watched each episode of lost 4 or 5 times and think you have caught every little nuance and clue hidden within it i guarentee you ll read this book and discover things you didn t catch or never thought of one of my favorite features in this book is the essay that details and explains everything on the invisible map that locke briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode lock down when the blast door comes down on top of his legs and a black light switches on illuminating the secret map bottom line this book is a must have for serious lost fans it would also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get into lost,positive

walzer s historical approach to examining just war theory is i think the most useful way to understand morality in war that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying if not prescribing moral norms from which the rules have been extracted be forewarned he does not cut the reader any slack this book requires some serious attention to the author s train of thought just war theory has two categories the justice of going to war and the justice of fighting once in a war walzer s discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that all is fair in love and war that is the path of least moral resistance \( or as clausewitz would say friction \) yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age old notion something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected yet it remains a prevailing idea for many originally coined by the romans it seems \( walzer quotes them in war the laws are silent \) they themselves were self consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist far from it on the otherside some critics find his argument about supreme emergency a moral failure and a cop out the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency one where normal rules may be relaxed if ever so little because of the especially pernicious nature of state sponsored genocide the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan for instance as having represented a supreme emergency and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell s perspective in the essay thank god for the atom bomb significantly for current events readers interested in the distinction between pre emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre emptive that impulse on the part of the neo conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects i think a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of pre emption michael walzer s well thought distinction between pre emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start regardless of its practical success down the road if we are fortunate enough to see that the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco where one fails to recognize the moral high ground one is doomed to moral failure walzer was vocal about the run up to war in 2003 and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world s police force,positive
this book is a must for anyone who works with older adults it is a photographic essay of some very special people people who embrace the robustness of life and who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as possible our world is steeped in ageism that is believing that older people are only capable of doing things that are appropriate for their age this book shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who continue doing what they love to do physically i wish that etta clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year i have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures that people give about aging it is a book to be owned not borrowed,positive
ethan mordden s editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs his political ramblings \( often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense \) seep through the book dragging it down the french people are slammed a number of times along with the aclu burt lancaster \( apparently according to ethan a good friend of stalin \) and the left in general while the author defends bush \( and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre \) the author s train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target any target it is often hard to stomach the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that it can actually make one want to look at the work again an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public the author is capable of better work,negative
the ny times book review linked this novel to the aftermath of 9 11 but that may have more to do with the preoccupation of new yorkers than with the story powers wrote while he does refer to 9 11 early on this book concerns environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong headed economic development in the great plains at the western edge of the midwestern farming belt it is about the struggle not to loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of america in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to the changing scale of agricultural operations but since it is a richard powers novel it is also about much more neuro physiology brain function as reflected in behavior and personality the devotion of a 30ish sister to her less able younger brother her sexual relations with two very different men and a nationally known writer \( clearly modeled on oliver sachs \) who has a late mid life crisis it is about love devotion and doing as much of the right thing as one can do it involves escape and return clearly powers should not be considered a regional writer his books have been set entirely or partly in brooklyn manhattan philadelphia l a the pacific northwest and the continent of europe but several books by powers are set in the midwest where he is based readers who know something of the areas in which those stories are set will gain an extra measure of appreciation for the skillful way powers incorporates subtle regional characteristics into these novels as others have said this is probably not the best novel this writer has given us although it is quite carefully plotted and full of the marvelous insights we have come to expect from him i prefer the goldbug variations three farmers on their way to a dance and despite my own musical illiteracy in the time of our singing but even when powers is not quite at his best he writes a better book than most novelists ever manage ever to produce read enjoy learn,positive

being a lover of freedom when the nazi revolution came i looked to the universities to defend it knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth but no the universities were immediately silenced then i looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom but they like the universities were silenced in a few short weeks only the church stood squarely across the path of hitler s campaign for suppressing the truth i never had any special interest in the church before but now i feel a great affection and admiration for it because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom i am forced to confess that what i once despised i now praise unreservedly albert einstein what i m getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad that s easy when you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily you may want to consider the source i e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution or maybe israel zolli chief rabbi of rome whose conversion to catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church s reaction to the plight of the jewish people this book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized it is important to read a work like this however in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author s motive,negative

this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre christian origins of the marian cult other resources however cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so called bvm the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church,positive

this book appears on most of the best of science fiction lists that various pundits and critics have put out even though it is not a very commonly known work does it deserve such a placing i think the answer to that depends upon what your viewpoint is about what science fiction as a form of literature is supposed to accomplish the idea is simple enough a new drug developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis is found to have the property of greatly increasing a person s intelligence but with major side effect it kills the user in about nine months the story follows one louis sacchetti a conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war and who would already be considered to be a genius by most standards as he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given this drug the story is told through the means of a journal that louis is encouraged almost forced to keep as this idea is extremely similar to that of daniel keyes flowers for algernon \( which was later made into the movie charly \) comparison is invited flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero a man who struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just himself but all mankind up against an unbeatable problem that of his own retreat to sub normal intelligence again camp concentration follows a completely different path that of the essential selfishness of the individual of nihilism of the despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful way the inmates that louis initially documents are apparently using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy as a means of providing immortality not for humanity in general but for themselves and the warden of this prison humphrey haast louis meanwhile seems caught up in crafting new poems and a play entitled auswitch a comedy the title is indicative of something disch does throughout this book playing with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words and is fairly effective in doing so the tone is the primary thing here a very dark brooding atmosphere enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many references both buried and open to other works of literature \( most especially dante \) and scientific and psychological theories readers who are not familiar with these references may feel a little lost at places in this book at least i did as my breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than disch s but from this tone disch develops his themes of the corruption of man of his baser desires the absolute horrors of what man is capable of and where such capacity leads as such this book is almost the complete antithesis of flowers for algernon that is until the ending of this book the ending of this book i felt rather drastically detracted from its overall message as it doesn t seem to fit with the rest and has a little of a deus ex machina feel to it given the many layered discourse that disch presented in the rest of the book which while sometimes difficult to follow was certainly excellent writing this ending was a disappointment while this is certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science fiction literature whether it truly qualifies as a classic will be i m afraid very much a matter of opinion for a long time to come but it is certainly worth reading if for nothing else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented reviewed by patrick shepherd \( hyperpat,positive

i m gonna quote a paragraph from the book please note in no way can this paragraph tell you anything about the book or spoil it for those who havent read it a woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling pirates with pistol her man in the battle s fray with his sword and shield standing victorious among corpses her man in a desert whose sands were on fire amid mountain peaks drinking the driven snow so long as he lived she would follow his journey would feel his elation and his grief and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart it would be the same for him in the midst of desert s fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear live live that was what the stories said about love that was what human beings knew love to be shalimar the clown was about as good as i thought it would be it definitely isn t the best book i ve read this year but i must say salman rushdie s writing style captivates me nonetheless in between the most relevant paragraphs he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader s mindset in this book he mentions a quote twice which really caught my eye one doesn t know the questions of life until one is asked another thing i noticed about the book is that the central character shalimar is seldom mentioned the book seems to hover around other dozen characters only in prison and in that one letter sent back to kashmira does shalimar s true character really come out the second quarter of the book got immensely boring and i really despise how max s character was written about it was annoying difficult to read over detailed and excruciating to read boonyi was an outstanding character so was the old witch and boonyi s father when colonel tortoise was mentioned in the book i thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything one couldn t help but dislike max s lack of integrity mythology is rather well written about in this book every 50 pages a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words conclusion while reading time and again i would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer s grasp on the reader is the writer knows his words where to use them he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever maybe this book disappointed his core fans maybe it lacked a spark enough to obilerate doubt all in all i can say that salman rushdie has a wierd way of his own his vocabulary is truly astounding maybe he is the most learned writer i ve ever read if not the best respect h s anand 17th october 06 12 13p,positive

dark tort was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read but for a novel that s supposed to be part of a quirky light mystery series i found things a bit leaden the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered and when we finally do move beyond that scene a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further i do admit that it also doesn t help that i m one of those people who can t suspend disbelief and have to ask so she s an off site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified but that s just me oh well many of the recipes did sound good though i doubt i ll get around to making any of them this is one of those reviews where it s probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series \( which i personally haven t read but suspect aren t much different than this one \) you ll likely enjoy this installment too the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b parker spenser novel for our light mystery fix,negative

i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is non existent we re supposed to believe that the haunted passive timid character dave was an all star shortstop in high school the book had a great premise and good beginning but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave s character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book s most intriguing character,negative
let s face it if you want to get a non fiction self help type book published and sold today you better have a completely original idea or make it controversial and provacative i would hope that ms bennetts opinions are written for this purpose since they are so extreme i am a college educated stay at home mom of two small boys i am proud to be doing that and to be defering to my husband to support me us financially in this mutual decision i feel it s a personal decision to stay home and try not to be judgemental of others but to me there is no career worth giving up taking them and picking them up from school everyday helping in their class having simple chats after school and most important being very present in their young lives does that mean i m sitting back fat dumb and happy expecting 100 to live the fairy tale so i can turn stupid and dependent on him for my every need of course not our relationship is solid his job is as stable as one can be we have good life insurance and a lot of it here s an important one we live within our means we don t have two leased cars and a house we can t afford in addition while i have given up my career to raise my kids full time i have a lot of skills drive and no doubt that in that worst case scenario i could provide an income when and if i need to i certainly would hope no one would give up the opportunity to stay home because of these so called realistic fears look if you want to be a working mom by choice knock yourself out but don t look for excuses to justify it to yourself and others by saying you re doing it in case of the worst that would be a bigger feminine mistake,negative
thirty five years ago my high school \( thomas jefferson in federal way washington \) held annual competitions in mathematics they did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet just was a few pages long there weren t many questions perhaps a dozen or two \( usually in the form of story problems \) but they required deep thought and concentration \( at least for me \) i still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as i took the white book and opened it to the first problem several hours later i d consider myself accomplished if i d managed to completely answer more than half the questions ian stewart s book reminds me of those tests here s a sampling of what s inside 1 \) mrs anne lida worm decides she wants a new couch and tells mr worm to get it for her while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby wermintrude but anne lina doesn t want just any couch she wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house and around the 90 degree hall at the end what shape does the couch have and how big is it this is a truly riveting story will mr worm solve the couch problem in time 2 \) alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes evaluating the influence of different soils he wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine his land is on a hillside though which is narrow so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land how can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species where any two plots have exactly one variety in common and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot sixteen chapters make up this book though their titles are whimsical the mathematical problems aren t some are still unsolved even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions and developed insight along the way that are at once challenging and rewarding here s a sample of some of other topics discussed in stewart s book how might one transport a lion llama and head of lettuce in a boat across a lake without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker how can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve how can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place suppose that you need to tile a room and the tiles come in odd shapes is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution can mathematics tell us things about evolution such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts \( or both \) this is a fun lighthearted book but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think i enjoy reading as i exercise on my elliptical machine i get double the sense of accomplishment when i can read and workout at the same time ordinarily i can estimate how long i ve been on the machine by how many pages i ve read 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average but with stewart s book i had to be careful several times i found that i d worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half a dozen pages or so if you love mathematics particularly mathematical puzzles then this is a book you ll really enjoy it has many problems for the reader with answers at the back of each chapter if you do the problems and understand everything in the book in detail it will occupy many hours of your time all in deep thought and utter enjoyment,positive
you get a view into 60 s white america the only people of color in this book are a policeman and a caricature i don t have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe this is set in everyday life and i think its best left on the bookshelf it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair not to mention various shades of skin colour the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one dimensional white depiction of the world,negative
city of the dead can t really be called a zombie story it s really a cheesy action novel that just happens to have beings called zombies in it the zombie aren t really undead like in the romero movies but are corpses possessed by demons i really didn t find any part of the novel scary and it doesn t seem like the author was trying to make it scary he seemed to take the route so many hollywood scary flicks take and just tried to gross out his readers through descriptions of the decayed bodies of the demons the action is clunky and not very exciting his hero s are constantly stopping to argue about things like how jim s ex wife raised their son while being hotly pursued by hundreds of demons there are too many parts that require suspension of disbelief a military humvee could never catch an explorer suv the hero s escape a fire by climbing across a ladder to the neighbor s house with the demons somehow not noticing they re being chased by dozen s of demon vehicles on the road but second s later after crashing they have somehow lost them and i have to ask why keene included the descriptions of necrophilia in the novel in the end city of the dead reads more like a cheesy schwarzenegger stallone norris movie than a horror novel,negative
the essential histories series from osprey could easily be compared to the cliff notes series they ll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with but no real depth most volumns are under 100 pages therefore don t expect many man in the trenches stories this volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war and presented a bit better than most in the series,positive

i first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages the children were enthralled with the illustrations \( as were many adults \) but the message was deeply felt by the older child in all of us there it is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him and brought him pleasure he wished that he could influence others but never knew what his music did for the world maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for the message is true for children and adults alike i will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend and from the pulpit thank you david mcphail,positive

i m the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life i m still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet flushing my wife \( may she rest in peace \) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a wyoming nature preserve anyway life moves on much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything i should know how to do but fred you might be saying \( and i ll be saying fred isn t my name idiot \) how do you know what you should know if you don t know what it is to begin with ah well let me explain see if tchikavoslky taught me one thought it was this i know nothing so it is with this deep insight into my own mind that i came up with the following things i should know based on what i currently do not know 1 how to start a hurricane this is very important 2 how to kill a man with a toothpick what if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim scary 3 how to run a nuclear powerplant with a one man army i don t want to be the next homer simpson 4 how to raise children i ve raised ten and still haven t figured out what a diaper is 5 what a diaper is i don t know my wife used to talk about them a lot 6 how to drive sure technically we re supposed to learn how before we get our driver s licenses but like many people i just got a fake one when i was 12 and have been driving since then i ve been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter so i figured it might be good to learn how to drive 7 how to stalk a celebrity you just never know 8 how to put on underwear without leaving stain marks you fellas know what i m saying 9 how to make coffee people ask me to all the time and because i don t know how i just take some warm water and pour mud in thankfully no one s noticed my inadequacies yet but i m sure soon enough they will after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection 10 how to kill yourself i don t want the aliens to get anything out of me when i m taken hostage i saw it in that tom cruise movie and it was sure scary so with these things in mind i m severely disappointed by this book and feel it is mis marketed and stupid please barbet schroeder \( or whoever the author was \) write a better book next time,negative

oh dear this is another book like the horrible who moved my cheese that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children like the aforementioned who thinks my cheese stinks \( or whatever it is called \) i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days it s all about making work fun yep work can be fun tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases of course it s just great fun to deal with children who have just had their parents killed or folks who just lost their kids because that s what work is fun or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers of course in the examples i have listed above it doesn t really work too well because this is really about getting people in perceived lower end occupations like factories or call centres to believe their mind numbing daily tasks can be fun myself i do have some fun at work but probably like many people with more than one brain cell it is based on having a laugh with my co workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us you can call this cynicism which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb fish style work must be fun philosophy i d call it black humour but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable as to the title of my review this method of making the workplace fun in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise first immerse people in the cult like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as fun second let them know that they now choose their attitude if they are unhappy in any way \( regardless of them doing their work well or not \) they are letting the team down and not complying with the obligation to make work fun third while the majority of victims or workers however you choose to view your prey swallow the work is fun message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron style message that they just don t get it in this way the resistant individual can be said to be incompatible with our mission and values bad for morale or just out of step in this way the fun loving workers who have now taken on the costume of forced false fun can be set against them of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign this book is useful then if you wish to convince idiots that their work is fun just don t try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously they might tell you to stick your fish where the sun doesn t shine,negative

as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises it s language is quaint and cozy to modern ears having first been written in 1856 but it is practical clear and encouraging it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw and by focussing on drawing with pencil it provides the foundation for using any other media a wonderful find,positive

while peter jay fernandez and jay o sanders aren t the only actors to narrate the acclaimed cross series they certainly are among the finest with a host of television appearances to his credit \( law order cosby \) massachusetts born hernandez has also made his mark on broadway in jelly s last jam and the merchant of venice his voice has a tad of huskiness which makes it all the more appealing as cross in all fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the alex cross tales so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene to date jay o sanders has narrated over 50 audio books and he s a perfect voice partner for fernandez his experience includes off broadway roles in shakespearean plays which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone the voices of fernandez and sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling cross stories to life it s a painful attention getter when we listen again to how cross lost his beloved wife maria she was shot down before his eyes her killer was never found the case chalked off as another sick drive by shooting now cross has returned to being a psychologist his children are thriving and perhaps he may be able to love someone again however a telephone call from john sampson his old partner changes all that sampson wants cross s help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in georgetown of course cross can t say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie in to maria s death some years ago one more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of james patterson read by two consummate voice performers gail cook,positive

consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan calvino s fiction is sui generis a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory oriented if on a winter s night a traveler this is the kind of novel borges might have written a celebration of the unbridled imagination invisible cities is also i am convinced a secret love letter to a single city the imaginary dream city of venice a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea,positive
this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy a year after this book was published there were over a hundred reviews regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author finds the author right or wrong interesting or boring this book is one of the most influential books if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy in fact the current bush adminstration s policies george kenan s containment henry kissinger s policies as well as countless adminstration s policies are shaped or affected by this book my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations differing on extent \( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after \) it is a fascinating book and hard to put down the author writes in a european style \( beautiful long sentences etc \) which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co students makes it more difficut to read he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically ms rice and mr kissinger were heavily influenced by this book to understand them this is a must read in and of itself it is an excellent book a classic and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists,positive

i first purchased this book when i was a freshman in college seven years ago it is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing i have ever read i love the plastic tabs that mark each section this guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section so for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape etc using the mla style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab i have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother a freshman in college i really wish i had this book when i was in high school i highly recommend this book to any high school college graduate student or writer i especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities i myself have add and before i got this guide i could not understand how to write a paper in the mla style or in any style other than a book report i promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published,positive
i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes but i have to admit i m disappointed with the recipes and with what i ve baked from it so far i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn t deliver the flavor punch of pure butter so i was a little skeptical and then reading through the recipes although they are very clearly written there aren t a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes the book already assumes a level of competence i made three recipes from the book the essential chewy sugar cookie the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie and the fudgy brownies all three recipes tasted delicious so i can t complain there but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes and both the cookies spread too much way too much and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results so right now i m wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up i think it s okay for a base cookie recipe book but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients,negative

i will start this review by noting two things i greatly appreciated nussbaum s upheavals of thought and i am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society i live in \( but then i recognise things in myself that for good or bad change my perspective from that of the society i am embedded in \) but wedekind s play springtime awakening should raise alarm bells for most of us we are sexual beings \( most of us anyway \) and we have to deal with that learn to accept it within ourselves learn to share it with others \( it is of course the quintessential sharing experience \) learn to grow with it learn to let it go the easy path to take is to grasp a social norm and follow it regardless of the morality of that path societies do present many norms to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable if nussbaum s book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable norms and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service there are curious things in this book for me nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male aristotle seneca js mill dh lawrence to be fair the last chapter is about to the lighthouse by virginia woolf and other writers such as andrea dworkin are prominent however i was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored where is mary wolstonecraft where is emma goldman where is mary shelley why is maurice \( forster \) referred to but not the well of loneliness \( hall \) the chapter on female genital mutilation \( fgm \) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted \( so i read \) to judaism while i would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk nevertheless i think the motivations for both practices come from the same source if for cultural \( religious \) reasons it is appropriate for jewish boys to be circumcised i think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate if not mandatory the chapter on equity and mercy impressed me immensely it is so balanced i expect many feminists will hate it but for me her rare use of a christian quote \( forgive them for they know not what they do \) was a revelation never before had i seen how compromised that plea is \( compare with tolstoy it is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself \) the fact that often i have other feelings than nussbaum expresses does not concern me because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts in the chapter on prostitution and its illegality i had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality the morality issues are complex perhaps irresolvably complex just as there are men with dangerous sexuality so there are women perhaps it s only an issue for men because they demand or expect control for me all of nussbaum s discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced the problem i see with prostitution is that it panders to the man s need to have sex they can get it on demand this reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives including the need \( wise or not \) for a woman to have a faithful partner in australia we had an advisor on women s affairs to the federal government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view based on her own practice that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting so he could satisfy his need when she herself felt incapable for me this is an appalling suggestion as if men cannot have self control and should not be expected to but for all of that like nussbaum i would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal for me this was a thought provoking read it had some incredibly ugly things to describe to consider but it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity other recommendations springtime awakening wedekind the well of loneliness radclyffe hall \( i hated the outcome of this \) matilda mary shelley \( her biographical details are worth exploring too \) godwin on wollstonecraft william godwin \( mary shelley s father mary wollstonecraft was her mother \) upheavals to thought nussbaum living my life emma goldman let me alone anna kavan conditions of love john armstrong,positive

this is the sort of book for paranoid people addicted to conspiracy theories they would rather believe a fanciful lie than the mundane truth though i don t agree with most of what s written in this book i don t regret buying it it teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and conspiracy theories if people believe that amalgams or metal restorations are the cause of their headaches fatigue or whatever symptoms then removing them will definitely cure them that s how faith healing works the only reason why i don t use amalgam in my practice is because i do cosmetic dentistry if the patient does not mind the colour amalgam is definitely a superior direct filling material for class 2 and subgingival preps i have absolutely no qualms about having that done for myself toxicity sure some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody but let s not forget that these cases are extremely rare \( perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be chinese \) there are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years there are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are if dr breiner has been to asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90 year old asian men and women who have gold and amalgam filled teeth in their mouths are composites totally safe the incidence of allergic reactions to composites \( very low \) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity this is something the author failed to inform us all his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam mercury can be very toxic but after tituration and amalgamation the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body it s different from inhaling mercury vapour daily injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds at the end of the day propagating such beliefs will only spark panic paranoia and various psychosomatic illnesses following breiner s protocols for detox patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise very simple dental work gosh with so many gullible patients in america i should probably move my practice to america and start doing amalgam detox instead of honing my skills for cutting crowns bridges and sinking implants,negative

what should have been a fascinating book at the very least as a voyeuristic experience fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages the text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author s failure at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling,negative
18 jun 2005 as the book progressed it got more and more egoistic to the point where it becomes a turn off towards the end of the book i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem shaq s attitude seems to be that since he can score he does not respect centers who can t score whereas he respect bill russell but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq so this is a big improvement,negative

love letters has a very simple concept two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage they never look at each other but within these letters is so much humor love and truth that the play will carry you away with delight i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i d heard so much about it after page three i didn t want to put it down now i m buying it for a friend don t think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance novel fodder if you have ever been in love you will recognize parts of yourself in this it always stays true to its well drawn characters which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful,positive
the book is not really on christ in the etheric but more several unrelated lectures about etheric life sometimes christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture the book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of cosmic life if you like the spiritual life that is connected with and influences life as seen only from with physical senses in the book is recorded about several ages \( golden age silver age iron age and dark age \) and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities or really spiritual consciousness diminished with each age and that the dark age has ended in 1899ac and that in this current age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a damascus experience \( experience of saul later paul in which he saw christ in etheric form \) people who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the earth consciousness sphere and could cause disturbances in the earth in this light rudolf steiner communicated about the brotherhoods in western and eastern countries and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet christ in the etheric \( 2nd coming of christ \( coming in the etheric \) and in future times coming of christ \( i e manifestation presence of christ in the astral \) \) in the book is also recorded about the sermon on the mount with the beautitudes \( recorded in matthew 5 \) where jesus communicated about the development of the soul \( as recorded in other books by rudolf steiner \( sentient soul intellectual soul etc \) \) in the book is also recorded about the afterlife if you like life of souls who have passed away and are still earthbound and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in earth in the book is communicated about different levels in the afterlife and how feelings and will are active it is recorded about astral plane lower devachan and higher devachan in etherization of the blood and later on again in three realms between death and rebirth where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the earth and how christ is also present there and can be experienced in earthly life as destiny and how people are so focused on what is or has happened but don t pay attention to what is result of it not happening \( e g getting delayed for an appointment or coming \( unexpectedly \) too early etc \) destiny is at work with christ having its workings present in it according to rudolf steiner in the book is also located about the double and how forces from within the earth influence it geo biology ireland was a place where those influences where most healthy for spiritual development cognition and ireland was the place where christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to europe by irish monks,positive
this book was on a very interseting topic the author took time in studying this topic it was about the impending world oil shortage that is the time when we the world will run out of oil it tells you about hubbert s analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from then they talk about where oil is they also talk about drilling for oil they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil sometimes it will take even more time then that then they talk about the size of oil fields they also reexamine hubbert s analysis later on in the book rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have hubbert was a brilliant man some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn t want to he told everybody the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about i wouldn t recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book,negative

i just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought and i found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me i had no idea where to start when i stumbled across the philosophy gym nothing could have been more appropriate it dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint it introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bite sized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter i couldn t be more pleased with this intro to philosophy,positive

i d never read berry before but as far as i can tell this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory however it s probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm there are two related problems with the book one of presentation and one of tone the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there s no room for specifics so while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry s vision there s no detail to back it all up the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at of course some of the pieces are lectures but there s a certain condescension that runs throughout the book it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of appropriate authentic and adequate when these are used \( as they often are \) there he s obviously made some kind of value judgment but the reader is never let in on it the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir which is unfortunate since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things \( though not his anti abortion stance \) small farms are good agribusiness is bad stewardship of the land is good extraction industries are bad treating the body as an organic whole is good and things of that nature alas he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed and communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people country life and country places berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses for example in one essay he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine untouched state and that s all while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry s views on stewardship and land use it certainly doesn t help matters that his view of small scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose colored glasses his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition however it ignores the fact that historically small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins was subject to all kind of external instability \( weather vermin etc \) and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level in farming cash is scarce that s why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself such as in wwii when all those defense industry factories were opened in california \( of course in berry s vision you don t really need cash because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors \) berry s exhortations to create small scale communities is worthy stuff and even in cities people are creating this the growth of csas farmers markets and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this however to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection,negative
great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity though edited by bob blaisdell who presumably provides the single paragraph introductions the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day their messages speak for themselves a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections one is their brevity the speakers get to the point and make it clearly few inclusions run longer than five pages there is also a level of genuine \( and often sad \) honesty many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation if such a thing was possible at the time the tone is often one of resignation but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed rightly or wrongly the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts the style could almost be considered anti oratorical though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english nonetheless the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people separated by years language and geography who retain a clear headed means of addressing their listeners,positive
reading late james particularly the golden bowl often strikes me as being similar to reading a novel in a foreign language whose vocabulary you have mastered but whose grammar remains partially a mystery anyone who has attempted this will recognise the sensation of understanding all the words yet not understanding how they fit together you read a sentence two three or five times and it is only then that you understand if at all the meaning of all the words combined sometimes the meaning never becomes clear late james is a foreign language but one in which i have become more fluent over the years when i first read the golden bowl some years ago i understood very little and did not enjoy it the long convoluted sentences with so many things only half spoken and often never spoken at all seemed a vast and elaborate machine which never seemed to produce enough to justify its own existence yet now having read most of james over the intervening years i have become more fluent in his language and find the circumlocutions complexities and ellipses of the late style if not exactly crystal clear then certainly much clearer and even rather comforting and enjoyable the subtle discriminations the way james holds up to the light tenuous motives and turns them slowly very slowly so that their hidden facets become fleetingly visible the very real portrayal of interesting characters that james reveals as well as the languorous unpredictable turns of a jamesian sentence all offer the kinds of pleasures that no other writer \( possibly excepting proust \) is able to produce the golden bowl consists largely of conversations some continuing over many many pages the content of those conversations would for most writers comprise the details between the main actions of the plot and for most writers those conversations would occupy at most a few pages but for james it is the interstices between big events the dramas not so much of everyday events but of the subtle daily manipulations the unspoken victories and losses of personal relationships which interest him and which comprise the novel the subject of the golden bowl is the reciprocal marriages of father and daughter to a pair of former lovers the novel is about the tensions and deceptions and the manipulations that arise as a result who knows what about whom who is responsible for what actions who is deceiving whom and who has the moral authority as a consequence ultimately who if anyone triumphs and is their victory a hollow one these are the sorts of questions james is concerned with the golden bowl rates as a great novel one of the greatest of the twentieth century because of these qualities as well as its ambiguities it is also an enjoyable novel but to enjoy it you must first be sympathetic to the sorts of concerns james is interested in and you also need to be conversant in his distinctive language both of these require or at least i would recommend first reading james earlier and middle period works for most of us late james can be a struggle but one which is justified by its rewards i don t regard reading the golden bowl as an exercise only for academics pretentious aesthetes or literary masochists but i sympathise with those who do giving stars to a james novel seems a little inappropriate \( he is beyond these kinds of simplistic judgements \) but i have given the golden bowl four stars because there are times when it strains the patience even of those who admire the writing style and enjoy the late james novels and i prefer the ambassadors or the wings of the dove nevertheless the golden bowl is one of the great novels in english and is highly recommended to anyone who has read and enjoyed james other novels,positive

this book contains reproducible mini books bingo cards flash cards some word search puzzles and fill in activities in my opinion the fill ins are a bit too challenging i even had trouble with them the only thing in this book really worth it that i couldn t make as well myself are the mini books the mini books each contain several different sight words so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them,negative
this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time it could be categorised as belonging to the same genre of action fantasy as a number of hollywood films examples of the rules of reality being abandoned the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter and the author even notes at one point how it s pitch dark outside yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other people spend minutes in freezing water yet pop out none the worse for the wear two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a spaceship has been found there shouted once through the radio a 12 year old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically nor apparently mentally a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it the stupidity goes on and on but that s perhaps enough to give a taste there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this but i don t enjoy books whose author doesn t have one bit of interest in any sort of realism,negative

i got this as both a book and an audio file i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts \( e g i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell what bible passage evidences this \) i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations where were his editors when this was being written why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those conservatives frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on i did appreciate his story about daniel and the delayed angel but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well the bible well so far i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself i wonder if i can get a refund,negative

what is remarkable about this onetime best selling book which could well be described as a coming of age without coming of age novel is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24 nope the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced the great gatsby a mere five years later this side of paradise is a mess it is as uneven affected feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero the tiresomely self conscious young minnesotan gone to princeton amory blaine \( one suspects in fact that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory s diary the result would have been considerably more readable or the book s structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable at least \) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 it was to prove the most popular book in terms of sales ever produced by its author presumably speaks to the public s recognition of something new and revealing in it okay amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype and the drinking and shameless smooching \( etc \) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably one can accept a revelation to see in print \( and likely a titillating one \) for an american audience raised on mcguffy s readers and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war welp here it comes on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon the petting party none of the victorian mothers and most of the mothers were victorian had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed to the reader at a remove of some 80 plus years this is of course very small beer what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now in the best cases of the paradise narrative as unalarming quaintness while this is not exactly fitzgerald s fault so to speak it is also true that the use of shocking revelations of this type scandals specific to a place and time represents a risk a writer takes the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and or universal in such episodes in any event the price the reader pays here in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory s adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties is very very high for payoffs of such modest proportions i mean come on for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it eleanor was say the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes yikes i don t care what new generation you re talking about can a flake pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody \( can it represent anything to anybody \) there are things to like even admire here and there in paradise fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark \( e g they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered sometimes i wish i d been an englishman american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy it s better to leave the blustering and tremulo heroism to the middle classes they do it so much better \) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator s observations is in its now curious way refreshingly bracingly funny slowly and inevitably yet with a sudden surge at the last while amory talked and dreamed which is about all amory ever does mht war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings when amory went to washington the next weekend he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens greeks he guessed or russians nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there s a war on i always say anyway most of the novel consists of young amory s elaborate ponderings romantic philosophical and egotistical which are as forgivable as they are forgettable i ve forgotten them already at some level in any case fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character who was of course a not very disguised version of himself for how else if not as commendably self deprecating irony are we to take this observation amory was in full stride confident nervous and jubilant scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty six hours in the end in any event one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder in paradise almost nothing works form content narrative stance dialogue character development pacing you name it it s a problem yet in gatsby five years later everything works everything if there is to be a great american novel it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b the fact is that he did and without point a the journey could not have begun so while this side of paradise hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon it surely deserves our respect and indeed our gratitude for what it led to,negative

richard fortney s earth is a survey in mostly layman s terms of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth selecting a series of locations where the earth s geology is apparent and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy preceeds to the hawaiian islands hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the supercontinent of gondwana for each location fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location along the way fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences it turns out for example that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates \( north america ocean bottom and northern europe \) the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney s historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages and fortney s explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader nevertheless this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history,positive

wow i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book luckily i got it out of the library didn t buy it i liked it at first but then the situations got more more implausible then i was reading it just to laugh at it some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too if i had the book here at work with me maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes not a well written book at all in my humble opinion glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway,negative

as a librarian and a lover of all things relating to arts crafts style i recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture s history and design evolution with clear color photographs and just the right amount of text this book illustrates the origins of arts crafts furniture in england and its progression first to our east coast and eventually westward across america in fact my only complaint about this book is that the photographs are good enough that they leave you wanting for more because of the depth of information presented here i would not say that this is a general interest read rather this book is geared toward those seriously interested in the history of the arts crafts movement and its recent revival,positive
i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything \( that would have been impossible anyway \) i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader \( civil rights \) and unsuccessful leader \( vietnam \) his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on line book study at the work and worship institute website i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society,positive
gibbon s decline and fall is without a doubt one of the most well written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the roman empire from the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the imperial court gibbon showcases the history of rome as it unfolded often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time there are a few minute problems or rather gaps in gibbon s work but given that he originally published in the late 1700 s we can excuse his lack of complete information overall an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject,positive

very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5 8 of the story i add 1 8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained but too often this reference becomes a one sided sermon for free trade these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton repubs kept the song going without missing a beat most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies the rich get richer in both parties feel free to read to learn about terms just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path,negative
explodes upon the crime detective scene the hundreth man his first book was excellent and the death collectors is as good and even better can t wait for the next one why this is an amazon sale item befuddles me but since it is grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel the psit team of lapd carson ryder and harry nautilus are faced with a dual time mystery more than 30 years in the past a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced and now starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of carson and harry the touch of subtle humor adds bas relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time perfect the murders are freakish disgusting brutal but the two psit detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old new mystery will knock you out of your chair a truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic partners against crime a series to follow and enjoy get both of kerley s books and double your pleasure try them you ll like them and you ll love jack kerley i promise,positive

i saw the movie in a theater when it first came out i was a teenager and although i believed it to be primarily a girl s movie i did enjoy it i ve seen it several times since then and it still has not lost its charm when i finally did read the book i was disappointed that the movie didn t follow it more closely to me these are two different stories the holly in the movie is likeable the novella s holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else \( when my wife saw the movie she remarked that holly was an idiot \) however the book s storyline is more interesting more haunting and the book s ending is more intriguing the movie ends as a love story the book is much more and oh yes whatever you may think of capote as an individual the guy was a damn good writer,positive

i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction apparently oprah s as well,negative
for the most part the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book s printing but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms be warned there are several places where the book goes awry for example the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal occasionally hunting in pairs problem no tracks of a t rex have been discovered to date a decade and a half after the writing aside from that and a few other points though the book is good reading,negative

pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics providing examples of practical application of each this helps the reader develop a critical mind capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws such as cultural and ethical relativism the reader will find that pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular but rather calls for reason and judgment based on strong moral principles in every situation some situtations call for a utilitarian approach some for a virtue ethical approach whatever approach he takes however will be based in thorough and sound reasoning this book makes its readers want to be better people,positive

i picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of dr king apart from the obligatory images we re force fed each new year instead i was disappointed to find that eric dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten one such example includes dyson conveying the idea that dr king may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right hand man ralph abernathy he then goes on to infer that there was talk of king and abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other the author had no commentary to either support or dispel this theory making dyson s retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous he just dropped the information true or untrue in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased to that end it is my opinion that dyson s intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth seeking rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen i m reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me an empty wagon makes the loudest noise eric dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance this was an expensive tabloid,negative
i didn t expect to like this book after reading the first 30 of 196 pages the graphic detail used to describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies made me wonder where in the heck this story could go and more importantly why would i want to read it where does the story go it s a wandering timetable we know the two main characters joseph and celice both professors of zoology married for 30 years are dead and the forward movement not only includes their ongoing decay but also their eventual discovery by police dogs and the introduction of their grown daughter syl as she copes with her knowledge of their death it also goes back to when they first met as students sharing a study house at the shore they are an unlikely pair and yet they come together through mutual attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience and live at least according to their estranged daughter an unremarkable life the timetable further allows the reader to relive the last day of their lives hour by hour from the murder back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day together at the very shore where they d met some 30 years earlier the layout of the story was brilliant and not in the least bit confusing the language \( british english \) is both lofty and gritty probably not unlike joseph and celice some of the thoughtful insights about life and death are very very poignant for example when syl contemplates the loss of her parents her gene supplies had closed shop their daughter was the next in line she could not duck out of the queue so she should not waste her time in this black universe the world s small breathing denizens its quaking congregations and its stargazers were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in hopes of paradise or fears of hell no one transcends there is no future and no past there is no remedy for death or birth except to hug the spaces in between live loud live wide live tall i thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating both the fact that life always goes marching on and the importance of our obligation to the dead \( and dying \) that we live life well the title and thesis of the book are one and the same being dead highly recommend from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group,positive

other reviewers have taken pains to outline the plot of this baby boomer bodice ripper suffice it to say author kathryn harrison scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that more is better offers estrangement between identical twins loss of a child incest paternity confusion mid life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink this reader was aching for the hero will to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like it s just it s what is it will doesn t have a word for what he feels \( perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader the author however should not in any case those are lousy lazy sentences among so many examples \) in addition to being insufferably cartoonishly silly the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure bad things happen to will the shrink will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened what he thinks happened and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks as for ms harrsion s famous sex scenes they practically lie on their backs fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval she s unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly almost unnaturally slippery envy by the way is ms harrison s 11th book and she should by now be getting things more right than wrong,negative

going to barsetshire is a delightful book and a much needed accompaniment to the thirkell novels ms snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29 novels in thirkell s barsetshire series and has produced a companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of the characters places and cultural references especially for an american who is not well versed in mid 20th century english esoterica i also enjoyed the writing style and the well chosen quotes in addition to the book s comprehensive content is its straightforward layout and user friendly format this exemplary reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production but instead keeps with the simple charm of barsetshire in its quality and overall appearance the original cover art showing an idyllic barsetshire scene is lovely i heartily recomend the book to all thirkell fans,positive

lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist ready if needs be to question cherished assumptions one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory where he initially states as he sees it the five big problems in physics in this context he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970 s there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and in particular he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics but then he builds up his case against the theory he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model probably the most successful theory in physics but even predicts particles not seen in nature it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed but notes that this theory m theory still remains a tantalizing conjecture he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says we are missing something big there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the murk into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature the clues are there to do this lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not and whether it is lateral thinking or a breakthrough revolution in conceptual thinking new thinking is definitely required lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation a good choice perhaps i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book if they have not already done so,positive
this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook \( certainly by european standards \) but the physical packaging is a total disaster it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins it is difficult to read text near the spine and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page the most unuseable book i ve ever experienced,negative
having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie antoinette but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual she depicts marie antoinette s mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married but arranged marriages were the norm the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen of which there is little concrete evidence but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant it seems to me that marie antoinette loved children so much she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france if marie antoinette had been caught in adultery it would have been considered treason she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her with all of her enemies at court that was not a risk she would have taken if she had been so inclined on a smaller scale fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie antoinette dyeing her hair in all the pictures that i have seen of her her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it not that that is a big deal but it makes me wonder where lady fraser s life ends and where marie antoinette s life begins i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie antoinette s death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king especially since marie antoinette s murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor sadly there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language one can only hope that the works of bertieres chalon and delorme will soon be translated and published in english fraser s book does have some interesting details \( aside from those which flow from her imagination \) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever s travesty,negative
i admittedly have not completed the full book as it is thick however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss for example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn t seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss barry,negative

i was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment one would think that a scholar such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the hebraic roots of judeo christianity it was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known messianic signs spoken of in the gospels he is also clueless to the pharisidical judaism of the time not comprehending that all of christ s teachings were completely in keeping with true judaism all of which can be found in contemporary rabbinical teachings of his time this book which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels like it or not the new testament writings are hebraic and explain what fulfilled judaism is those who need to divorce judaism from christianity are offering a church which is already confused just more confusion it is through studying the hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the difficult sayings of our lord fullfillment of the law binding and loosing \( the law \) etc as well as the parables the delivering of the deaf mute was a messianic sign because the rabbi s knew that they had to ask the said demon its name but he did not lazerus s resurrection was a messianic sign because the rabbi s believed that anyone could come back to life during the first three days after death cleansing of a leper was messainic sign because the rabbi s understood that it was a divine punishment that only god could lift how else can we link isa 53 with the stripes he was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the law required for transgression and yet minus one had our lord transgressed the law then the jews themselves could have legally killed him remember paul \( saul \) he also does not understand john and his huge part in the whole picture in that the kingdom began with john he was the breachmaker as fortold in prophecy this is hebraic roots 101 people please study the hebraic roots of christianity and do not waste your time with this book the fact that he keeps defending his position as not anti semetic should give you a clue,negative

being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a hard industry i personally believe that it s in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that s the foundation of real wealth not legal services or newswires so this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is and suggest ways to improve it oh how very very wrong i was this book started off strong for about four pages after that a litany of tortured logic un sourced assertions facts taken completely out of context except for the author s subjectively added adjectives orwellian double speak sleight of hand arguments flat out ridiculuos statements contradictory assessments and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left george soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century even a broken watch is correct twice a day though so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating these include manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs provided it s run right \( a big if \) high wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates there is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain \( i e enron \) a scholarly fair and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful this is not what you ll get in this book though instead you ll get a begining section about postindustrialism things like the internet information technology financial services etc the things that make the services based economy in three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men set them on fire and piss on the smoldering remains this is where vitriol even comes out where he equates the post industrialists to people incapable of even thinking if someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument they probably don t have one most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist to me this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to oh i don t know let s say a fish a middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing this is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there s no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large this is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data charts of gdp growth over time pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services manufacture agriculture etc you will get none of that there s little value except in reassuring the obvious high wage nations can do manufacturing many of these cherry picked anectdotal examples still don t quite dove tail with all his claims about manufacturing though you also know you re being left in the dark with a plethora of cya disclaimer statments like while industry x has certainly had its share of problems recently at the begining of a section a final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez faire free markets and the concept of free trade george soros and a bunch of other lefties with pat buchanan thrown in for balance should be listened to instead the worst part of this book is the author s lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument examples of twisted thinking abound a post industrial industry grows five times over in a certain period the author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60 self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise the author s challenge to the reader seems to be who are you going to believe me or your lying eyes he rips into american post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world later he talks about how great german manufacturing is because germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world s workers the only facts he presents and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context when describing service industries paltry 50 million revenues only 60 000 jobs disappointing 24 of revenues from foreign sources is common but when describing manufacturing a very high 6 million revenues a good mix of 1 500 jobs and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow a number in and of itself means nothing the fact the author leaves out any head on direct comparison between industries is telling official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes when the official figures don t agree with him he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong when attacking his straw men though he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner gems of orwellian double speak sentences include examples like solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity \( pg 184 \) i e it s competitive where there is no competition and even in singapore one of the freest societies in the east the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings \( pg 229 \) that s not very free if it s forced is it \( his defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages i ve ever read and really is worth the price of the book he capstones it with the most encouraging observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out wow what an achievement any actual power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it s internal workings wear out but whatever \) americans are dumb and the only successful american companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards the american economy despite the statistics is in bad shape the japanese instead are eight feet tall can read people s minds and see through lead the japanese economy despite the statistics is in really great shape this type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments the author basically can t get out of his own way he always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don t put numbers into context are using twisted logic making mere assertions instead of quoting facts etc apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses he claims boeing is no longer a good company because 30 of components in a boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs 2 in the 1960 s this is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper america isn t doing that badly in aerospace by the way the author fails to mention that 50 of the european airbus is made in america this is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient the list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions you d have to buy the book to see them all because there s at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page all in all this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity it s really a mercantilist argument and the only common thread that i could see in all the author s cloudy reasoning is that nation s should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what it s not unfortunately a book about how to revitalize american manufacturing in a globalized world,negative
this book is the same as teach yourself origami and origami the art of paper folding just with another cover to make you think it is new also in the webside they describe it as a book of david brill it does not contain nothing of him not even his name mention if you have no origami book it could be good for you other wise beware,negative
i can not put into words what this journal of the truth has done for me as a african american male living in the united states of america i was introduced to this book by a man of guyanese decent who knew i needed to read this book i have to admit it was a difficult read because my primary education only spoke of american history and there was no mentioning of any african caribbean contributors from the middle passage period now at thirty nine many things are clearer to me roots and beloved are historic well documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race creed or color to make sure what i read had some semblance of truth while in puerto rico i visited a sugar mill in guanica and my heart just melted if you read the book you will understand my feelings i became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of american children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from africa south america the caribbean asia united states and europe eric williams i know i can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken thank you for everyone else read the book it will cleanse your soul and feed your mind once you finish this read how europe underdeveloped africa by the same author,positive

this is an excellent book its academic sociological approach may put off some lay readers but that would be too bad the subject and the message are both very important in many ways this book is similar to the appearance of impropriety how the ethics wars have undermined american government business and society but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social science standpoint an excellent book well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed \( at best \) results,positive

i read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me that s why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again oh boy am i glad i bought it since last time i read it i have read many romance novels many great one and many bad ones too i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong this book still made my heart race made me smile at joe s attempts to make ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them joe s character was just amazing and most endearing was his insecurities here was a navy seal one of the toughest possible guys and he was insecure about his upbringing and background he felt veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him he was sooooo sweet he was so cocky stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from veronica just goes to show how a person s outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them i can t find any more book of this series i am still searching for them i know i have to read all of them,positive

if you want to believe an illusion go for it some readers say he is well informed whoa this guy talks about science without any credentials to do so if it makes you feel good to believe that the us is bad the environment is collapsing and we need socialism to survive then this is the book for you if you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion find another source waste of money,negative
the author had a great idea but he cherry picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense for example superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2 two jewish guys right at the end of ww2 write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b c it s destroyed etc etc i m not critiscizing this book b c it has a religious message i m critiscizing it b c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement otherwise i disagree with anybody that says it is just a comic superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america,negative

this book ranks along side will durant s story of philosophy as the best book on western philosophy the key difference is that whereas durant deals only with some selected individuals russell gives a comprehensive history topics that get the short shrift in most histories \( pre socratics medieval philosophy etc \) are given the full treatment here howp has an authority that few can match russell was a great philosopher himself no history of western philosophy is complete without a chapter on him the book is strewn with gems of wisdom 1 the union of idealism and love of power has led men astray throughout history and continues to do so even today \( on sparta \) 2 religions that condemn the pleasures of the senses drive men towards the pleasures of power throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic \( on the clergy in the middle ages \) 3 contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people s happiness and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race \( on continental idealists \) at times the book does get a little dense there is only so far russell is willing to go to make the subject accessible to the lay reader i would especially recommend this book for history buffs russell dovetails the development of western philosophy beautifully with european history there is no better way to develop interest in a subject than to read a book that connects it with a subject you are already passionate about,positive
the humor is definitely not in the book reviews and summaries use the word hilarity however i did not come across any situation that i would classify as even funny not to mention hilarious i thoroughly enjoyed her first novel pink slip however this one seemed depressing the two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story the plot seemed to be very slow the whole story took place in a matter of days but really nothing took place in the book all in all they bought a house i would pass on this for better reads elsewhere,negative
i didn t have especailly high hopes for this book i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years and this one brings it to a new low basically it s waaaaaay too long at 850 pages it s a monster read and a slow one that s not always a bad thing sometimes if you like the characters it s nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page but not here why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language for several paragraphs more than once why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services i think i d be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book though i can t quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it s been out of use here for decades maybe it was easy to cut and paste and got the word count up and then there s the space combat a strength of the series especially the first three or four but there s the rub there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up by the 11th book in the series i can t be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences but the big problem spoiler alert is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with honor loves hamish emily loves hamish hamish loves honor and emily what to do it turns out that there s an easy solution after about 400 pages of agonising \( not to mention most of the previous book \) it seems that honor can marry them both a bit outre seemingly not apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom \( although we ve never had a whiff of this before \) but what really gets me is that the reason it didn t happen about halfway through the last book is that \( get this \) gosh no one thought of it it seems that no one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i all in all i can only say please mr weber it is time to bring the series to an end please do it soon,negative
i m very disappointed in this book although some information in it is valuable it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need although broken into sections they are not readily found or visible one must search the information needed as in a research assignment the reproducibles are mainly for elementary grades this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it s contents on line although the price was reasonable i m not pleased with the way the book is organized printed,negative
i was referred to this book by my midwife \( debra o conner \) as a book that i had to read as it s content was so right on and was she ever right i know alot about my body i am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a 3 year old that i had at home i spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process that was great knowledge to add to the physiology i learned during my massage training this book though is something that every woman in our culture today should read i now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken i hope to give this to everyone i know who has a daughter i hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message it is women s reality and needs to be shared of course it is written by a midwife thank you elizabeth,positive
do you like romance novels do you call your dogs your babies this is the book for you the thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge this was my first johansen novel and it most certainly will be my last two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends,negative
surely i m not the only one who found this book totally bad the only thing it made me wonder about is how it s possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women the writing is just dull and full of the author s biases and prejudices which just aren t nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves it s written in that old school feminism \( negative no fun \) tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond my advice find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder s lens,negative
i forced myself to finish this book though it was touch and go in several places just so i could feel able to review it fairly it seems i liked it even less than reviewer ms trieste cf below but i am in general agreement with her points there are just so many things wrong with this book that even the grating famous names don t really stand out for me let s see where to begin the naive political ranting the unspeakable dialogue the corny love interest the wholly implausible technology the absurd coincidences the distractingly disjointed structure the proliferation of minor characters the talky explanations of the detective s thought processes the total incompetence and corruption of the police i can t go on it s hackneyed and poorly written and that s all there is to it,negative
the text is ok and the way the story is cut up in frames and assembled is competent but the drawings are the work of a hack often tacky and always styleless and garishly colored the costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight the attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book an affront to connoisseurs of either opera or comics or both only valuable as a kitschy curiosity,negative
if you re in the bathroom with time on your hands i must admit that i did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over puzo \( like leon uris \) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception in just a few hundred pages president kennedy ii is shown as a tyrant a socialist a reactionary a humanitarian a political bumbler a visionary of usa utopia a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector a dear and loving husband father etc how many characters must one man be and what s this odd sub plot of a former mormon hollywood oddball who on a whim \( in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself \) decides to kill the president of the united states once again another character with fourteen different personalities puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the mormons \( he should have stuck with the catholic church \) i would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me i would go crazy reading it again,negative

although i have only read a few specific subjects in this book i am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life threatening disease for anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum \( hg \) reading that a spa day would be beneficial is not only absurd but also insulting many women with hg cannot get to another room of the house without help much less drive a car to a spa hg is a disease and not a psychological condition women cannot stop the disease at will this myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children some women have life long effects \(,negative

someone gave me this book as a gift why i have no idea this book is about as intelligent as a tv sitcom about as funny as a tv sitcom and generally at the level of a tv sitcom i found it neither funny inspiring nor interesting it is in the final analysis proof that any book that purports to be about strong or outrageous women will immediately sell thousands of copies regardless of the piffle between the covers and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything probably best for teenaged girls who don t read much it s no worse than tv i guess,negative

i am not going to go over the contents of the book or much about charles bukowski because if you are considering this book you must know something about the man and his work i will just give you my impression of this collection of work no collection can ever really be complete there are always new things to add new commentary newly discovered works transcripts of records and unpublished letters but this book does an excellent job in its attempt to me charles bukowski will always be one of the greatest american writers of the twentieth century because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates it is funny sad sadistic cruel scathing enlightening and thought provoking everything i like to read this is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers trees and greek mythology this is raw human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper it is not perfect and it is not trying to be it doesn t always work but there in lies the subtle beauty of bukowski s efforts the guts to try the attempts at honesty clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything and his cynicism of man this book has one of the most moving amazing and insightful poems or anything else ever written it is called the genius of the crowd if you read that work of art and are not moved nothing will this collection is shocking in its beauty and inspiring by its simplicity enjoy,positive

this book has a lot of insights about various ways in which the pace of life and learning have since the scientific revolution accelerated in other words it is a book which gives one much to think about the problem is that it also suggests that given the vast increase of information available to us the vast increase in possible alternatives for our attention that we will probably have our minds moved away from the insights so rapidly as to not even absorb them the obvious reply to such an intense barrage upon our consciousness is to withdraw and when we withdraw and close out all that is accelerating around us we begin to try and make a pace and story of our own within ourselves the faster we are forced to go the slower we may need to go i think a companion volume or perhaps a contradictory volume should be written on all those human activities which might be aided by our going slower in them and along with this volume should be advice and recommendation of how to keep out of our life these seemingly endless intrusions which disrupt our living by our own rhythm run slowly slowly horses of the night,positive

true there are many controversies raging about copying dvds and copyrights i suspect we are in a transition zone with all this and the industry will figure out how to help people love and cherish their dvds rather than simply calling everyone a pirate having said that i can also understand why an author of such a book wouldn t want to say too much about this controversy especially if he his looking over his shoulder at the lawyers i was trying to think of an analogy to express my disapointment in this book \( and this isn t a good one \) but it goes like this you want to go to israel and you buy a book on israel for dummies and you search for something anything on the controversy of the wall they are building but instead of finding a discussion of the controversy you find a few off handed quips about there s a wall going up and it s causing some controversy nuff said nuff said hel lo were dummies out here that s why we bought the dumb book there might be some useful information for some people but i was sorely disappointed,negative

this book is offensive to at least one of the two genders though it s hard to say which it suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot more or less whether that s more insulting to the male brain or the female body i m not sure but the book portrays neither gender realistically i like heinlein and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass and it s not even particularly good at being that the gender swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so but heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo enlightened erotica instead of literature more s the pity,negative

firstly i have not seen the film adaptation of single white female and so this review isn t tainted one way or the other this book about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate is written is very easy style characterizations prose and dialogue are all straightforward i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel and the book s feel is anything but original sliver by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life \( and danger \) in manhattan for a single white female still single white female is an entertaining read bottom line a very enjoyable suspenseful read that doesn t tax the brain recommended,positive
arrogance by bernard goldberg is a truly enjoyable read goldberg doesn t waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to islam or communism he just presents the facts as he sees them as a former insider he s got the dirt on media bigwigs and he s not afraid to dish the liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions \( some tongue in cheek \) for correcting this slant he also includes surprisingly frank interviews with tim russert and bob costas goldberg s other books bias and 100 people who are screwing up america are also excellent reads he doesn t attack people on a personal level \( although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against dan rather \) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country but goldberg s books don t have that effect you can tell he not only loves the country he lives in but also the profession that he s chosen and he has hope for the future,positive
rewind to 1992 it s the dawn of the so called information knowledge age back then i wrote a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the creativity of all employees in an organization the rationale to create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition with pressing needs for superior innovation and improved productivity amid ever leaner budgets \( sound familiar \) flash forward a dozen years to today and ideas are free \( a title echoing phil crosby s classic quality is free \) this new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a decade ago failed to eradicate idea stifling organizational cultures way too many work places it seems still quell expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees and middle managers so the case for turning on the innovation spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor in answering that call professors robinson schroeder offer some worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever ideas are free presents an articulate case that organizations and individual managers need to unleash the still largely untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately held back by employees three elements make ideas are free especially worthy of your time and money 1 the authors aim their advice at regular workaday managers sure they rightfully point out how organizational systems are often dysfunctional and they make the case that many corporate practices actually discourage creative contributions by individuals even as they try to incent those very behaviors but robinson schroeder don t aim their prescriptions at policy making top executives only many chapters conclude with what the authors term guerilla tactics clear directives for simple actions that even frontline supervisors can put to work without the boss s permission 2 the book dramatically makes the case that paying for ideas as part of an organization s formal suggestion systems is fraught with potential negative side effects my own corporate experience as an executive championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the startling reality that this well intentioned process can turn into a self destructive minefield \( and let the record show i largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back in my 92 work \) 3 many interesting well developed \( albeit occasionally dated \) anecdotes illustrate the book s sound principles they help make ideas are free a grounded engaging and palatable read back in 92 i suggested in my book mavericks that managers should be asking questions like what is the value of a useful new idea if one good idea leads to another where could thousands and thousands lead us what is the cost to the organization for not tapping the endlessly renewable resource of ideas in our employees heads getting to the root of the problem i asked isn t the job of a manager to recognize and choose from lots of great ideas generated by fellow work associates and answered unfortunately most managers even those who claim they invite suggestions from their people subscribe to the time honored myth that a manager s job is to have the ideas in 2004 robinson schroeder again plow many of these very same themes \( and cite data that also have been around for a long time \) still this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise from drawing out the best thinking of every employee and it presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to effectively deal with these still critical issues wherever you sit in the hierarchy read ideas are free to seize powerful ideas about potential gains for your organization s progress and prosperity don blohowiak lead well institut,positive

noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his yours and mine the united states of america he has made millions of dollars teaching lecturing selling his books and investing his world wide fame in psycholinguistics is well deserved his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u s in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism when he always ranks the u s and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now and even in history his distrust of any authority benign or otherwise is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the underdog even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah yet since 1955 hypocrite chomsky has worked for the overdog massachusetts institute of technology which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction and continues to this very day chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money earning the adulation of the american left and freedom to express himself he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea iran or syria let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much the united states of america god bless america which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak teach and make lots of money raybo,negative

i read an interview with mr vollman i think a couple years ago i can t quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people they save marriages they provide comfort to the loneliest most desperate among us in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman s writing on the surface whores for gloria is one desperate delusional man so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes it isn t fully clear if gloria herself was ever real but regardless it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples such as hair clippings as well as emotional artifacts the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories the prostitute complies as best she can but story after story the narratives veer into disturbing material the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time the more intelligent and observant one is the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius such as a thelonius monk solo or in this case vollman s writing i ve never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness and no better forum than gutter sex which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling and he doesn t do it by being overly clever he does it through the chaos of brute honesty whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing the end product is very readable and deceptively simple,positive
native tongue by carl hiaasen this book is fast paced has a lot of energy and a zany weirdness no doubt it is a page turner and it is better than the other book of hiaasen s i have read double whammy but all that does not a good read make a strength of hiaasen s books are his characters well defined and numerous most are straightforward stereotypes from the out of luck journalist turned publicist the vapid sex phone girlfriend a steroid doped strongman the crude and sleazy millionaire bad guy a muscular but clear minded black good guy cop to the dumb but intrinsically good guy burglars and loads of redneck florida crackers hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops and by casting two characters that are quite original an environmentally militant 70 aged woman and an environmentally crazed former governor gone wildman and we meet psychotic whales and sex starved dolphins etc etc so what s wrong mainly it s that the book stays at a level of tv sitcom gone book it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject one might think that the exception is the environment but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment if you like brainless action gratuitous violence gross humor and zany fun native tongue might satisfy i have one additional problem with hiassen and it s similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton these books stink of hypocrisy crichton makes a \( seriously good \) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science hiassen s heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society but hiaasen s writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent,negative
i know a lot of people liked this book but i felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds i didn t realise so much of the book was focused on diet it says you should plan on gaining a pound a week and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be well the first 13 weeks i managed to gain nothing and i felt horrible about it but food made me so sick the last thing i could do was eat more food to try to gain weight the book said that according to my starting weight i should try to gain 50 60 pounds during my pregnancy i decided to stop reading the book and so far just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when i ve managed to put on 20 pounds my twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy this book isn t horrible but i would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used don t spend the on a new one and be prepared to put it down if it doesn t sound right to you,negative

more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn t make that connection having read a few of faulkner s works sturgeon uses many of faulkner s narrative trademarks \( i e streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative \) but i didn t feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others so the idea might of been original in the 50 s but topics like telekenesis esp computer brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before \( asimov \) and since this book rarely set off that wow button in my head or kept me turning pages this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book \( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 \) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting \( in this example \) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can t really be ignored besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood s end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci fi needless to say more than human did not win \( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so \) bottom line i wanted to like this book and it doesn t surprise me that others give it such high praise these are probably people that don t read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests,negative
i am a huge thomas hardy fan and i was not disappointed with this book at first all the technical astronomical information was slow but the love story started and that was forgotten my only complaint about two on a tower is the ending it seems very rushed everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages it wasn t realistic for viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later considering she was only 33 at the end of the story sir constantine was possessive jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him the bishop was full of himself how is that worse a few years with him and all of a sudden she s an old woman with a heart condition swithin comes back and says he ll marry her she s overcome with joy and boom she dies in his arms i also find it strange that neither swithin or viviette acknowledged that the boy was his didn t people in the village realize who he looked like since people were already suspicious of the lovers what will happen next swithin takes his son in and marries tabitha lark a very good sad complicated romance,positive

this book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules which is of course of fundamental importance to the chemist bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book this is a book that i often use as a reference this book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas it is not a particularly advanced book but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when i need it,positive
i read this book with an open mind i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status in a few cases i think this criticism may be legitimate in other cases not so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community \( note i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction \) i didn t find anything in this book to convince me of that what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports \( audits etc \) to which the author refers but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to play the victim card and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author s allegations to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage and to the extent that this book detracts from this i think it is unfortunate,negative

every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading and look for a surprise or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out it is with this mindset i picked up wouldn t take nothing for my journey now and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration ehh ms angelou may not take anything for her journey but based on the cover price she will take 17 00 to tell you a bit about it and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided whatever the cause this book is dreadful if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble gook i e about boundaries respect finding ones direction learning what it means to be a women etc then this journey is for you but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere,negative

i dont take neither stance on religion nor science with these comments i have read the book and i have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly it has one goal sell sell sell if you are after useful quality informative knowledge to gain well you wont find it here im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says non fiction the author is a talented story teller add a few statistics here and there a dash of scientific key figures mix it with life s controversial unsolved mysteries a few more dash of historic events and famous people add and link a few references here and there and wala you have a best seller isnt that ironic it is a new york times number 1 best seller it was an interesting read though,negative
when i was in the sixth grade we moved twice and in all three of the schools from new jersey to connecticut to japan i got to study ancient greece in the history part of the class i also got a lot of mileage out of having read edith hamilton s mythology \( i still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations \) but in all the times i got to study ancient greece before during and after the sixth grade i never got to do any of the fun stuff that avery hart paul mantell come up with for ancient greece 40 hands on activities to experience this wondrous age this kaleidoscope kids volume for kids ages 7 12 not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the ancient greeks so this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands on experiences it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used throughout the book there are great greeks and things to think about after reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from ancient greece hart and mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when then the book looks at key periods of greek history meet the minoans the pre greeks of crete looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of greece with activities to make a greek yo yo a great mother figure a hamster labyrinth \( without the minotaur \) and a fantastic fresco that gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to greece itself other chapters are devoted to the age of heroes where you get a super short version of the iliad and can build a trojan horse language unites \( including speaking pig greek \) the dawn of a golden age where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath and ye gods greek religion and mythology where you can design your own constellation in the last part of the book chapters cover classical athens the flower of ancient civilization where you get to build a greek temple with ionic columns \( or even build the entire parthenon \) think for yourself philosophy where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium and the amazing arts which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a greek play in the second part the final chapter covers a wider world alexander the great and the hellenistic age where you can start a library at the end students can appreciate how being a greek meant standing in the center of the world \( as least as far as the ancient greeks were concerned \) again there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity understand why every vote counts in a democracy and decide what makes somebody beautiful learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when throughout the book hart and mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions which remains the biggest legacy of the ancient greeks i teach classical greek roman mythology \( not to be confused with modern greek roman mythology apparently \) but i teach it online so i do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands on activities but that does not mean i cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on ancient greece although i am suddenly reminded of coming up with the sparthens \( a k a the warriors with the brains \) in elementary school but that is another story,positive
this book was so badly written that i just couldn t help writing my first review on amazon i never bothered writting reviews while i fully respect the authors decision in providing the book online under the creative commons license and while i do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions the book is a total f ck up and f ck up is an understatement the book 1 \) is unorganized i felt i was being bombarded by information from all directions one moment i was getting ready to test a simple hello world module and the other i m suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter how the hell did i get here it just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated 2 \) is upside down i read chapter 3 \( char drivers \) and i compare it to real device drivers and some things just don t match the book seems very theoretical because the real device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all after digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet i realize that in the real world there is a whole driver model and generic objects and what not reading the source code documentation and some online material i actually understand how the real drivers work i still don t understand the stuff in the book i start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver model and i find it in chapter 14 the driver model seems in my opinion the first step to understanding how real drivers work and i find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce not only that the authors decide that many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely and the complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high level view surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book 3 \) is sadistic one thing i really hated was the carrot and stick approach the authors chose first they give you a small tiny taste of a topic which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you re about to reach somewhere they do a complete u turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off the topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better you end up confused annoyed and duped like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the hello world module ok fine seems easy enough you naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself haha wroong the book suddenly does a make hello c without showing you the content of the makefile it leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable hello c and goes on describing in detail seemingly random stuff you are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter as is i chose the former hahaha wroong agaaiin i ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later \( at least they mentioned it \) in summary i d suggest you buy the book and \( as documentation managementstyle for another book says \) not read it burn it it s a great symbolic gesture i don t think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book if you come across any online material that recommends this book quickly discard that material too without thinking this is a 5 stars book it has affected me personally,negative
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara s pulitzer prize winning killer angels and because i m a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it s a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just isn t quite there any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear the hawks apparently are from atlanta but an atlanta team braves or hawks whichever would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season finally when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game he does so in the semi hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium not on the mound on the field this book was published posthumously and mr shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose prose that was excellent in killer angels it s unfortunate there are glimmers of interest in the book but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author s other book,negative

my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people s conceptions about going to the moon at that early time he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn t make much sense well from a layman s perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic physics and astronomy even from my scientifically deprived perspective a lot of things in the book didn t make much sense such as the actual method of getting to the moon but this doesn t really take away from the book it adds greatly to its appeal the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work and what these poor souls were going to come up with next compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality and much unlike his other works doesn t stray far from the earthly some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read if you drop at the sight of f \( x \) y then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today if you like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time,positive

harvey e goldberg is one of the pioneering sociologists in the study of the jewish communities of north africa especially the libyan jewish community in this present work he brings to bear the experience and knowledge of a lifetime of study and practice as a jew to provide an overall historical anthropological view of the jewish life cycle he opens with a chapter on being jewish then considers birth circumcision naming he goes on to discuss rituals of education and then has a central chapter on marriage an especially innovative section is on pilgrimage and creating identities in this one he opens one of the central themes of the book the way the increased importance of the individual in jewish life and thought has led to more varied religious practice his chapter on death mourning and remembering also includes a consideration of communal remembrance this is not as might be expected his closing chapter as he adopts the traditional teaching which he is reminded of by one of his many interviewees and ends with something good his final chapter is on bonds of community and individual lives this book is extremely well written and a delight to read i especially enjoyed the instances where he brings in personal anecdote to illustrate and deepen a set of observations goldberg has a true command of traditional jewish religious sources and these texts form one real basis of his life but what is especially exciting is his reading the communal variations across time in response the religious and communal demands as one long familiar with much jewish tradition and ritual i was surprised again and again by new observations and insights anyone who loves jewish learning will love this work tremendously i cannot recommend it more highly,positive

well after i received the book i have to say i was quite disappointed because i am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books after i read the reviews i thought i was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables it turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures if you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed dont buy it the other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented,negative

this book shows in detail how much of the media has gone out of its way to attack the president and how many facts have been distorted in the process it also provides a rare look at what the president really does with his time and how much effort he puts into his work if you are looking for a book that labels president bush as a liar or a dummy this is not the book for you but it is a superb look at the events of the last year and a half including the election of 2004 don t be narrow minded i highly recommend it,positive

no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his experimental school who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of progressivism i would dewey s conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child s self posed questions the problems in dewey s model begin with his science fair meets museum meets playground meets lecture hall school design the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive classes are small and require several specialists and non reusable materials as if kids didn t have enough problems with the basic skills set already dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics even more outrageous in dewey s model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind how could dewey s recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child s intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance deweyism of course like many other off the wall theories of education denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted particularly project follow through the great skeleton in the student centered advocates closet i d personally like to see dewey s updated plan for seamlessly moving kids who come into class with their natural inquisitiveness programmed by tv rap music and other pop media into colonial american history calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes tennessee williams and the plus que parfait tense but of course such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old fashioned academic corpus along with the old fashioned school system 90 of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged maybe the answer doesn t lie in yielding to children s lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice dewey s progressivism relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education from the absurdity of it i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop out rates lowered standards and social discord but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one,negative
i have read baldacci s first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them this one however is just awful not only the character s dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows with lame lines like the gun was loaded and so was i that is exactly what this book is like except it goes on for 400 pages there isn t a single interesting character in this book in my opinion you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end it s the bataan death march of novels i hope this is an aberration i ll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good but one more stinker like this one and i ll drop his name from my reading list,negative

like most of the reviewers i went into this book expecting the humor and absurdity of the website and it s all there in it s ridiculous glory however this book is almost like two books in one upon reading the footnotes a much deeper tale begins to unfold beyond the nonsensical ramblings of robert the book tells a tale of a lonely kid using ninjas as an escape from his sad life his parents hate him he has no friends and nobody else listens to him except his babysitter and faithful dog the further you read the more you begin to see the deeper story unfold however even while the story gets darker the humor remains creating an experience that is both hilarious and touching check this book out,positive

i loved the first carole matthews novel i read for better or worse and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight but only because i didnt have anything else to do i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning to me matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her i think this is a horrible unrealistic messgage if you want to read something good pick up a jane green novel instead,negative
when i purchased this book i expected it would be life from a particular bacteria s perspective by this i mean well today our host started a new antibacterial therapy the last round of therapy was tough but we managed to make it through unscathed i m confident we ll survive unfortunately what i read was a scientific book written in non scientific language as a biology major in college and a medical student now i ve read many scientific books written in scientific language so many that they are pretty much all i can relate to anymore ha actually that statement has more truth in it than i care to admit but i thought this book would be a nice change of pace instead it s a listing of information about a certain bacterial species that i could have extracted from bergey s the book is undramatic and uninteresting i wouldn t recommend it to anyone,negative
reading through john irving s the cider house rules i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity in obtaining a bachelor s degree in english i had to read a lot of books among them were many books that i did not like but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along people become pregnant have abortions and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing the book doesn t flow naturally you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows playing the puppet master there are just so many coincidences so many old friends just happening to run into eachother so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly all of the characters vaguely distantly connected to eachother i don t want to spoil the plot but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames \( rhymes with screams \) family is just too much coincidence to bear it s as though the author is god and the characters completely lack free will and then there s the protagonist homer wells i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story homer wells barely does anything in the story he barely even speaks during the story he is virtually a non character devoid of personality or will around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all and they make up the majority of the book are without fail the most interesting scenes i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr larch but even melony seems more real than homer does the story is very long and rambling subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on minor characters keep popping into the story then disappearing only to pop back into the story exactly when they re needed conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten \( like the situation with debra pettigrew \) after such a rambling at times rather boring plot the ending feels rather rushed it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything tie up every loose end in the last 25 pages \( and tying up loose ends in this case means a lot of people conveniently dying \) to spoil the plot just a little homer wells who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion i personally am pro choice as well but i found that homer s sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily ever afters,negative
no doubt about it this book covers the history of the border patrol however it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a fluff piece than anything else as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent \( 13 years \) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job \( many say a necessity \) pacheco as an active agent \( when he wrote the book at least \) appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line \( i apologize for the pun \) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed if so then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security simply put the border patrol as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating remember the incompetence of fema \( a homeland security subcomponent \) well multiply that incompetence times ten heard about the poor morale of fema employees multiply that problem by one hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety percent of their time trying to get out those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs the bottom line is that as a former agent i lose sleep at night knowing what i know pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u s border patrol agent the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits read the book for enjoyment and homage just don t expect critical analysis in fact this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge \( for you ib agents in san diego \),negative
perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others lacking even the slightest trace of shame he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses as a result there s nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages even more pitiably like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to sanitize his clandestinely acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed one wearies quickly of the manichaean results and like any ideologically driven but technically inept would be nuclear \( or social \) engineer he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was why even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home s 1977 underground classic a savage war of peace considering that home s tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot s this is irony most profound it is scarcely surprising then that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear splittingly trumpeted in boot s book thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot s espoused belief system recently reprinted and highly recommended,negative

drummer hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of drummer hoff the man who fired it off in this story a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon each man brings something different one man brings the barrel one man brings the carriage and at the every end of each stanza it says but drummer hoff fired it off this story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story the colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal the story itself doesn t have any significant moral element to it it is just a fun book the rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous by the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud a good holiday gift,positive
i am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion i am not religious and i strive to take a learner s stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that i present to my students betsy and guilio maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics books that i have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias this particular work unfortunately is neither their gesture was genuine and gracious an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote no deity need take offense all were included in the pantheon of possibilities it is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors though written as an overview of many of the world religions this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other one point ought to be obvious though everything can t be true the religions mentioned are like oil and water they can t mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts an appeal to their similarities doesn t help we would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form it s the differences that are critical that s true in all areas of life especially the spiritual if god exists he s either personal or not personal he can t be both if god is merely a cosmic energy why ask his blessing he can t hear or respond if he s a person then he s someone not everyone this book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew,negative

if you are familiar with the work of strobel this book will continue to impress you if you are not however and would like to know where the author is coming from i encourage you to read his previous works the case for christ and the case for faith so that you might better understand strobel some people have condemned this book because strobel doesn t present the evolutionary side well i have a few quick observations to make first of all he s a journalist he asks tough questions and for the most part gets good responses second everyone has an agenda without exception strobel and those who he interviews analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern darwinian scientific views finally it is clear from the outset that strobel wants to make a compelling case for id this is not an unreasonable goal the fact that he doesn t interview evolutionists shouldn t bother anyone based on his obvious objectives if you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a point counter point series book if you want to understand the current id debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator this book is for you,positive
this text was assigned reading in a psych101 back in 1970 but its themes have stayed with me so strongly i am now ordering it for my personal library i was born with a club foot and experienced the power of being different even though my personal defect was so minor as to be rarely noticed by others stigma gave me an appreciation of the force behind my own shame and the reaction to my difference of others more importantly i learned about the degrees of identity which differences make the most difference \( sex race disabilities \) and the increasing intensity that comes with breaking the most closely held norms a classic study,positive

i didn t like the only other dean koontz book i ve ever read watchers but i enjoy reading kevin anderson s stuff so i thought i d give koontz another try because i m a reasonable person and i understand that not everyone can like everything by an author on to the review i realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but i think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through the dialog is mind numbing and predictable every time there was a car scene i could guess what kind of conversation would be held you drive too fast are you my mother over and over and over the idea was good a modern day frankenstein or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day \( yes i know frankenstein was the doctor not his monster but you get what i m saying \) but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would or like a play this book had so much potential but the authors laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn t made cost it dearly,negative
i couldn t finish this book after readng fairytale misfit insecure caucasian male falls for asian stripper prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets i thought possibly this story reveals a lot about olen butler he wrote about this relationship with such relish he sounds to me like a p c caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the otherness of asian people and doesn t see them for what they are just wants them to appreciate big strong white man i thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother so she was not honest with him but olen butler wrote about her as if this stripper pros was wonderful the kind of wife any man would want i shook my head and thought you have issues probably if she were caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something after this the other stories just did not appeal to me,negative

perhaps the long shadow of francis parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the french and indian war \( seven year s war \) whatever the reason it s good to see from the publication of several books that americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre revolutionary period when the british were triumphant and the indians still counted as a political force it s past time for a thorough revision of parkman who was ungenerous with the indians although i thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity for example the insensate fury of the iroquois actually the iroquois were less insensate than they were astute calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the english victory over the french in north america in particular he focuses on the frontier and the built in conflict of american settlers british policy and the indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the french or were betrayed by perfidious albion they made their point however in pontiac s war and by clearing white settlers from the frontier but their numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed this is a good book about the issues of the frontier between whites and indians in addition there s a good account of the french movement from canada to louisiana and the spanish rule in florida and the trans mississippi smallchief,positive

herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not the trial against paul merker in the east which had as its background east germany s reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance moreover they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia,negative

i am in the planning stages of a new business venture i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself this book reads like a list of useful one liner marketing tips and examples of how the author s friends have used them it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12 week commitment mailing list that the author has created he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks hello mcfly didn t i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights yes so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career my price of admission stops at the price of this book and it should not seem like i m only getting half of the story that i paid for,negative

the scientific method applied to this book 1 \) form a hypothesis great managers do something differently than mediocre managers 2 \) conduct an experiment interview 80 000 managers 3 \) analyze data this step is missing 4 \) draw conclusions write this book with the exception of the 12 questions the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study they make several insightful statements such as many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes however they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement did 90 of the managers interviewed state this did 60 of the great managers state this while only 10 of the mediocre managers did does many managers mean 100 managers 100 managers seems like many managers at first but considering 80 000 were interviewed i 100 managers is a negligible amount the entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study it seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently the authors found almost no common trends however since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study they needed something to show for it and wrote this book if buckingham and coffman didn t claim this book was a result of the largest study of its kind i would say it offers some decent advice however since it does make this claim i wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are,negative

in his last command gaunt s ghosts have returned from their mission on gereon a chaos controlled planet to ancreon sextus where war is also raging in a continuation of the story of gaunt s ghosts they have been changed which is frightening to those around them they changed in order to survive on gereon but others think the transformation may be more sinister therefore they are put in internment camps and questioned finally they are allowed back into battle as the forces attack sparshad mons a step city ruin on ancreon sextus which appears to be filled with the enemy not many people want to listen to gaunt even though he is an expert warrior with sharpened senses nothing is as it seems as the battle progresses and gaunt must find a way to get his superiors to understand what he knows will gaunt ever convince them that what they are seeing is not really what they are seeing dan abnett has written a sequel to a story that i think you would need to read before tackling this one after a spell things did become clearer and i was able to pick up the storyline the characters were well flesh out and the writing was smooth but the story did move a bit slow in places when some of the battles were taking place there were many battles and a lot of dying on the battlefields strange monsters inhabited the land and only gaunt knew where they came from the monsters were fascinating in that they could not be killed in a normal way only gaunt s ghosts knew how to get rid of them reviewed by alice holman of the rawsistaz reviewers,positive

be aware that the reviews for a book are displayed not only for one edition but for all editions under the same title the oxford philosophical texts edition of hume s treatise should be the standard student edition the prometheus books edition is cheap but it does not include a modern introduction or any study notes i recommend the oxford philosophical texts version if you want or need more than just the raw text,positive
now i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person in fact probably more than the next person since the average next person hasn t ever read any tales of derring do adventures to unexplored distant lands lost civilizations great artifacts etc that s all good stuff what s not good is this book which is tedious in the extreme on the surface of it haggard s followup to his hugely successful \( and infinitely better \) king solomon s mines has all the elements a dynamic duo of scholar adventurers \( one of whom is descended from pharaohs \) a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man an expedition to africa and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life however despite this promising laundry list haggard s execution leaves a great deal to be desired a friend described it rather aptly as a book with a lot of story but not a lot of plot which is to say that in my edition some 320 pages are filled without much happening there is the initial mysterious set up the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations the heroes conveyance to the lost city and then and then things kind of grind to a halt lengthy descriptive details lengthy internal ruminations lengthy rambling speeches lengthy everything but very little of consequence occurs until the very end when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh everlasting life i suspect much of the problem stems from the book s origin as a long running serial in the gazette as i understand it serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment and thus it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words judicious editing could reduce the book to 1 3 of its size without any loss of note of course as another friend pointed out it s probably best to read the book is small chunks just as one would have done with installments spreading out one s reading of it over a period of time he suggests may serve to conceal the book s rambling nature in any event there are some nice scenes here and there such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches but those are about all i m likely to recall from this book in a year of course as is noted in the introduction to my edition haggard lifted the main elements of the plot and even the the true name of she who must not be named from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer lytton so one can t even give him much credit for imagination i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen racism anti semeticism misogyny fear of miscegenation etc but as entertainment for the modern reader it falls woefully short of the mark,negative

talk about taking the joy out of an experience i read this book prior to a week long trip to venice this book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives it is a poor guidebook and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue the history and art of venice are covered better in books from those genres the only upside is that it is short yuck what a waste of time my advice is get a novel about venice if you like novels a guidebook if you want that an art book or a history book at least you ll get something out of those this one tries all of these and fails actually in terms of a travelogue vendela in venice far surpassess any other venice book i have seen although i originally bought it because it is considered a children s book it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it,negative

it s easy to realize once again what makes garth ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading this one throughout the story i was unable to predict what was going to happen on the next page and despite ennis making this into a rollercoaster ride he still keeps it all believable mind you this story is not on par with the preacher series not much is but it still is a story that rises far above the average comic book story the characters are all interesting often funny and they ll hold your attention with ease not once was the story faltering and in the case of you being a smoker maybe at the end you ll be cured of that habit as another reviewer pointed out this is one hell of an anti smokers add so if you feel like picking up a well told story with constantine in the lead you ll do best to pick up this one if however you are not yet acquainted with ennis s preacher than you better turn to that one,positive
look the fact is feminism is about choice no more no less i have the highest respect for stay at home moms it is the hardest darn job on earth but this woman is way off base to say that feminism sold us a lie feminism gave us a choice it told us we did not have to pretend to believe we were june cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls personally i could not have children and only feminists have not made me feel like an alien species i work with troubled teens my skills do not go to waste i spoil my nieces and nephews i am fulfilled and happy my sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys she is fulfilled and happy feminism gave us those choices ladies we were not sold anything we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us if you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world s most important job i think that is your issue and not now s stop blaming feminism for your insecurities if you are feminist stop blaming your mother for your insecurities you have choices because of feminism not despite it,negative
i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling while reh was first and foremost a story teller pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather s remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades this as previous reviewers have mentioned creates a large gap between reader and story but why do this why use such a crappy method of story telling i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue all in all it s a slow uninspired day dream story so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews i want my money back,negative
i was very excited when i got my copy of this book i am a big fan of medical thrillers i started with robin cook and michael palmer and from then on i was hooked unfortunately for me i selected the wrong book it was very slow and he didn t pick up the pace until i was about 60 pages from the end then all hell broke loose i have a feeling that josh got a little help from people telling him to spice it up all in all i was disappointed and still don t know what perv means hope he does better on his second i will give it a try but only the first 50 pages if he hasn t hooked me by then i ll give up,negative

bailie draws on rene girard s theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence i found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory producing a hard hitting indictment of all forms of violence whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act increasingly i find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice i have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading violence unveiled nor do i react to photojournalism with my previous detachment the impact stays with me despite the fact that i read the work initially two years ago when i borrowed it from a friend i now have my own copy heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by bailie s excellent analyses provocative and insightful,positive
i expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts too technical proofs homework questions irrelevant to the material insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are this book really surprised me because it wasn t mathy at all it doesn t just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts which means you only need common sense not an intensive mathematical background to get everything the examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts each easily and naturally leads to the next if there s anything not thoroughly elaborated they were sure to cover it in the homework questions by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them not just how to plug numbers into some formula if anything i d say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little but then again you could always just skip the easier parts,positive
although everything is shown in silhouette there is plenty of color and action and my kids \( boy and girl now 3 and 5 \) have always like it there are herds of elephants steaming machines flowers critters and more as the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find i won t say more but in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they didn t like them but i think they miss the point the book is about shapes and how much you can identify without the advantage of a detailed picture and looking at the silhouette and identifying the item creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story if you used pictures you d hardly learn anything about shapes would you no the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds for reaching for that aristotelian abstract \( lol \) of what is skunk and it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with seuss odd artwork five stars 19 pages of fun for boys and girls this sturdy boardbook is a good read aloud that stretches the imagination,positive
rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in cross creek florida in the early 1900s it is often assigned reading for teens but i doubt that most of them can appreciate it her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior the lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies she turned those into a cookbook which i ll have to try out modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the n word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible drunken immoral etc it is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written so recognize it as a snapshot of the times then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book \( i deducted 1 star for this \) the reader becomes absorbed in rawlings love of the land and the creation of a home it gives much the same feelings as a year in provence or under a tuscan sun,positive
i ll put my opinion first so there won t be any doubt in your mind i don t believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as national character people are just too different too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you how well can you predict what people in your own country will do would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as mr barzini i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man s views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the inside view the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history socio economic patterns religion family etc but the specific results are just that specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last the tragedy of italy s long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian character is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page myself i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy read another book if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you,negative

moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas s writings on discourse ethics written in the early eighties this translation which was published in 1990 provides a developmental perspective the focus of the essays moves from habermas s statements about the role of philosophy today in philosophy as stand in and interpeter to his writing on reconstructive social science in general to his program for a discourse ethics in particular the final papers address criticisms of this program the volume suffers a bit from the fact that thomas mccarthy s introduction is keen to locate habermas s position vis a vis various contemporary moral philosophical standpoints but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of habermas s overarching social theoretic project,positive
to learn some italian before visiting italy i tried multiple language learning programs borrowed from my local library some were ridiculous many required using a workbook then i stumbled on the pimsleur program which is totally audio allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work due to the pedagogically sound method pimsleur developed for language learning i actually did learn some basic italian as a result i bought conversational italian though i ve never considered myself adept at language learning i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds i ve raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language,positive
this is a charming little book it s very concise profusely illustrated and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids it delightfully summarizes the work of plato theaetetus archimedes euclid kepler and euler in only 57 pages half of which contain only illustrations as a model builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra i was a little concerned when i looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about sacred geometry fortunately \( at least from my point of view \) it does not contain a word about it except for a cursory reference to the elements plato associated with each of the platonic solids a table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids all the info a model builder needs this book won t impress anyone with a mathematics background but for a layman like me it s a perfect introduction kudos to sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format,positive

though i usually go in for tough police thrillers i sometimes mix things up by reading a light funny mystery or like this book a quiet thoughtful mystery set in a small town \( a cozy i believe this type of mystery novel is called \) still life nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a cozy mystery quirky eccentric characters a small town setting pretty much no violence with a little modernity in the form of occasional well placed profanity \( though not much \) and modern demographics \( a gay couple is included among the main characters \) the main detective character intelligent and interesting owes a little to christie s hercule poirot but not everything the mystery itself is pretty interesting too though some aspects of its solution are a little broad and clunky as are some of the explanations of why ultimately cleared characters were acting suspicious for a time any shortcomings are quibbles however and shouldn t deter one from trying out this nicely done mystery story set in a quiet little corner of quebec,positive

this book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys exalted the book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows the book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses that is the only way i can discribe it there is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat and then others that are there is a section on warstriders basicly single man death machines that basicly look like large metal robots most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like i don t like saying that is what they look like because well this is rping people things change by a player gm s perception anyway enough of my ramblings this book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to royal class warstriders this book is about gear in the world of exalted p s it looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books my best guess is that one will be for sorcery but that is just one book if you think of anything else post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones,positive
in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details witty asides and \( especially \) luxuriously reproduced introductions hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages he hopes to provide brief non intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science there is astonishingly little text and at times the pithiness compactness and occasional cuteness may work against readers understanding there s perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader \( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time event horizons and brane world models \) the text is aided greatly however by the beautifully rendered four color illustrations even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design s artwork will attract engage and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation overall then the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated yet it s certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further if you re looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here i strongly recommend \( as does hawking \) alan guth s the inflationary universe or brian greene s the elegant universe,positive

i thoroughly enjoyed the author s earlier work on how the irish saved civilization but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book taken in its subparts many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight where s the big picture the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks variety of human response lightening quick transmutations resourcefulness and inexhaustible creativity a subtitle like a greek treasury of personal vignettes might have been more descriptive and merited another star but it falls short as a hinge of history with impoverished and even maladaptive connections \( fdr as solon really \) to the modern world i am sorry to not recommend it,negative
there are just too many errors of interpretation omission and commission in this book to justify purchasing it in this review we will concentrate on rima s \( r \) handling of the work of j m keynes on p 84 r s claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is surprisingly suggestive of j m keynes s idea has no supporting evidence to back it up on p 133 r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand a la keynes what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and or intuition that ricardo s deductive analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking \( or assuming away \) the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo in chapter 20 of r s book she attempts to deal with keynes s theory of effective demand and keynes s discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20 titled the employment function r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book replacing her chapter 20 with keynes s chapter 20 r s figure 20 1 discussed on pages451 454 directly contradicts keynes s analysis,negative
this book unlike morris s work on hillary is actually worth reading because its perspective and analysis of our 42nd president is fascinating though the title is a little tiresome \( and becomes especially so when morris continues to say throughout the book why because he could \) the book is a fast page turner i particularly enjoyed morris s portrayal of clinton as one who only came to life around other people if they were happy he was if they were in distress he felt their pain a master of reading people and changing according to their feelings clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president who ruled by polls enter dick morris as clinton s chief poller he also became at one time his chief political advisor and clinton needed one as my life by clinton shows the president had no overall strategy and failed to see events as interconnected for him each issue needed to be examined individually and with clinton that was a laborious endeavor the prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with equal weight and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious to take action result fiasco s like waco somalia bosnia and health care reform more seriously for the future the loss of the congress to the republicans \( over ten years now and counting \) and the failure to stop bin laden morris gives credit where credit is due though clinton s work on welfare reform cut the roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction allowed the economic boom of the 1990s to take place also interesting was clinton s use of the presidency as a bully pulpit for families and education an issue that was local politics and therefore cost clinton nothing in the budget but brought in massive political capital read this book before reading clinton s my life why because morris points out the inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein also morris says that the president s autobiography is the rosetta stone that decodes clinton if that is the case then morris is certainly the interpreter,positive
reinventing the bazaar used real life examples to make markets understandable to any reader from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers eyes he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets and in my opinion he succeeds each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points while the book has an economic undertone the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student all terminology is explained not only with words but with examples as well the book was enjoyable especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings however i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book,positive

i read the good doctor s book eat to live and then bought china study which he talks a lot about in this book then i bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though i do feel he s being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own being a vegetarian for more than 37 years i became an almost 100 vegan after reading eat to live and have to say that i feel great with more energy and even started reducing anti depression med i ve been taking for severe depression yesterday i took my last pill all week i ve been emptying my refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow and reducing my one cup of coffee in the norning to none because i remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache i m going to do 10 days and hoping for 14 i ve done 3 day fast before and one 5 day and that was great yes there are some flaws in both books and i wish the good doctor would have made use of a good editor as it s not as professionally written as it could be and the recipes in eat to live are atrocious with too much canned foods and not healthy organic foods but i ll forgive him because he got me on the china study which changed my life and his studies and own experience helping people get well are good and inspiring why am i going on a 10 day detox water diet i read randall fitxgerald s one hundred year lie and that was the catalyst that pulled it all together for me a detox fast absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many years on anti depressants i m keeping dr fuhrman s fasting book close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and encouragement i did make the mistake of telling my coworkers that i was starting a 10 day fast though the good doctor warned me not to the comments from them were typical i suppose knowing their health or lack of but i held my tongue those comments are just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of dr fuhnman s books make along with other nutrituion books but i thinkof the wisest words you are responsible for your own health and think about my not being able to remember the last time i had a cold and the last flu i had in 1964 and smile i don t intend to support the ill begotten medical pharmecutical industry the last time i went to the dr i promptly firedhim after his continued to badger me into getting manograms and other tests i repeated that i eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do with breast cancer and i just walked out of his office forever i d rather read a book,positive

cajun cuisine is without a doubt the best cajun cookbook that i ve ever used i was born and reared in southern louisiana and the recipes detailed within closely mirror the exact techniques seasonings and spices that i had learned by watching both my grandmothers in their kitchens and how i was personally taught by my grandfather at his hunting camp you cannot go wrong with this book jacque,positive

i admit i haven t finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women s health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn t alternative enough for her,negative
dr hawkins first book power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology however he began to venture into misapplication of this method and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity concept or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement there are serious logical philosophical and practical flaws in his work and his attempt to quantify matters that aren t quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques the actual technique is worthwhile but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate valid answers hawkins explores issues about media politics religion spirituality history philosophies healing arts entertainment and more and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters liars and two faced sociopaths he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don t resort to hawkins misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful responsible work in those areas for now i d encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world,negative
i m amazed that people didn t like this book more i am also a land arch student who had it as an assigned book that was rarely actually assigned i was thumbing through it in hopes of generating ideas for another class and was amazed at the amount of usable information it contained perhaps it is better digested in chunks instead of the whole i found it great as a reference book,positive
first let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail he does not he hikes less than a third you dont find this out until 2 3 through the book which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad to an ill effort to fulfill a contract my conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher could not and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics as others have said in this review forum this book can be snide highschoolish and down right mean i fail to see the wit in his endless negitivity and bashing this book has a few funny parts but i cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments it is so unbelievible in places that you know you are on an imagined tangent dont waste your money or time i am so happy i bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale,negative
i only glanced through this book yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied i can however write about one of the editors mike shaw who made no attempt whatsoever to find the evidence when assessing us as parents he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an expert witness and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were at risk of neglect mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched under cross examination he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations luckily for us he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist i don t know about his co editors but if his work is anything to go by the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously evidence gathering on 9 8 02 i interviewed mr mrs orman 2 hours on 21 8 02 i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone 40 mins witnessed contact 1 hour and spoke to the children without their parents 20 mins and i interviewed the foster carer 2 hours observations mr mrs orman were friendly and co operative throughout mr orman showed insight but wasn t concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children the couple were very robust in refuting the welfare s account which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation contact took place in the park the parents and children seemed happy to see each other they chatted in animated style i wasn t aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children s presence interviewing the children the children seemed attentive but answered don t know fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions erin related a simpsons episode where homer had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman s temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed note this is submitted in court as an evidence based legal document conclusions recommendations i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact i think there is some insecurity in the children s attachment to their parents note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs asked whether he had any regrets mr orman didn t take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care erin who was 8 at the time needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper and support and advise socially i suspect mr orman would find this difficult my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging sic children the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed sic and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home returning home is likely to further retard the children s social and emotional development these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause i also find very plausible ms charlotte curran s suggestion \( in her written statement \) that mr orman dominates his wife the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible i believe the children need a long term placement away from home with experienced foster carers contact should be gradually reduced mike shaw s answers under cross examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6 hour investigation yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed so that the children could lead a normal and happy life he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70 of all children placed in long term foster care end up as delinquents our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt and the case was eventually closed so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions,negative

i picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands on science activities that are essential to good teaching and effective learning unfortunately i discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific establishment with credulity for numerous fringe ideas the first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you ll be home for dinner sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as evidence the do it yourself promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn t intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or doesn t happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants \( such as the speed of light \) to nine significant figures far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given \( in chapters about the feeling of being stared at or feeling the touch of a severed limb \) despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book i liked a part of its message that important science can still be done by amateurs that s about the only aspect of this book that is commendable,negative

the chocolate war the chocolate war was one of the best books i have ever read not the chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene the boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot i would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate i don t think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level this story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out i think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of archie archie is a suspicious character that knows every one i wish this book was more school appropriate but it isn t and was a horrid book therefore this book would be great if the author published a book with the sam story but more school appropriate situations and words,negative

anyone with intelligence can see that ann coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective analysis of politics she is using inflammatory marketing to stir up the emotions of the most die hard flag waving conservatives until this attention seeking labeling of other americans as good or bad stops there will never be true understanding of the complexties of american politics or foreign policy by the general public i don t agree with bush s war and i didnt vote for him but he s not a bad person he did not invade iraq because he is evil or stupid i can appreciate both sides of an argument i can avoid generic categorizations i would never watch any news liberal or conservative that had a clear political bias why can t ann coulter arrive at this same level of common sense well she wouldnt sell as many books she wouldnt be on tv it has to be liberals hate america or the conservative nazi agenda we have the duty as thinking americans in the most advanced free country in the world in these modern times of massive amounts of free information to stop paying attention to this garbage get the facts and stop relying on a figurehead to spoon feed you your opinions,negative
the author is reusing a similar plot device than in twisted a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything that is a poor strategy for a mystery novel because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes the narrative in general is not kellerman at his best either the characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do a small part of the book talks about brazil and kellerman simply invents a couple of portuguese words making them sound spanish \( favilla favillitos \) one wonders how much of the author s research is similarly fictional in sum a book carelessly executed,negative
the savory way is an early \( 1990 \) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author deborah madison so as ms madison has a new book on the way i thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so i can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books ms madison is a former colleague of alice waters and lindsey shere at chez panisse who specializes in a very general way like mollie katzen and madhur jaffrey on dishes that fit into a vegetarian lifestyle note that the term vegetarian especially as used by these three authors is extremely misleading as it is much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of everything under the sun except meat fowl fin fish and shell fish both madison and jaffrey make extensive use of milk cheese yoghurt and eggs madison s objective in this book is in fact to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be done without using animal flesh the book s title may be a bit misleading to some foodies in that savory is often one of the words used to divide dishes in two great groups of savory and sweet this book in fact includes two rather long chapters on sweets a first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the many recipes the first thing you need to know if you are put off by chatty recipe books is that these notes are almost exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved with the recipe and how to get the best results from your ingredients while little stories about the historical provenance of a recipe may interest many including myself that is not what this book is about on top of this i firmly agree with the blurbed opinion from mollie katzen who compliments both her cuisine and her writing almost all professional culinary writers are pretty good or have an excellent copy editor at work on their prose but ms madison is a food service professional who writes very well i often wish the soon to be beknighted jamie oliver had a bit more talent with words as i find his books so comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors the very first attraction of the book is its table of contents which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book this is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes suitable for just about any time of the day including a good selection of recipes very good for breakfast the eleven recipe chapters are quick bites with 40 pages of recipes for sandwiches toasts and spreads salads to start or make a meal with 42 pages soups and stews with 50 pages of thick thin and pureed soups including a new one with my favorite fall ingredient chestnuts eighteen quick pasta dishes for five and company 32 pages stovetop vegetables 27 pages of sautes and braises baked and roasted vegetables 25 pages with ratatouille gratins tians and other goodies grilled vegetables and their sauces 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish down to earth 26 pages on rice potatoes and beans \( although beans appear throughout all chapters \) morning foods for day and night 26 pages of eggs and cheese and cereals and breads finishing touches 31 pages of sauces salsas condiments dressings pastes and you name it desserts 45 pages on fruit dishes cream cheeses pastries and custards sweetmeats 12 pages on sweet pastes peels syrups dried fruits and other dessert dressings every recipe i examined is relatively simple to prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may find with jaffrey or jack bishop and great tips on understanding the recipes and the ingredients the appendix is just right for the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the second floor at zabars ms madison puts it all in perspective by highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots the mortar and pestle a few good knives the food mill and the pizza stone and peel the chapter on the pantry has lots for the novice and a few good tips for the foodie such as the fact that mexican olive oils can be very spicy possibly the best items in the appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as entertaining feeding large groups and fitting into a low fat diet \( note that for the number of recipes in this book this low fat list is surprisingly short \) the list of sources is short with no internet sites provided but i recognize that virtually all of these vendors are still in business the bibliography is also brief but hits all the right titles especially joy larkcom s excellent the salad garden this book is a great resource for liberal vegetarians who simply eschew meat i would add this to madhur jaffrey s world vegetarian peter berley s the modern vegetarian kitchen and jack bishop s the complete italian vegetarian to create a great core vegetarian library i cannot at this time compare this to ms madison s other books as this is the first i have read although i sense many of her more recent books have a narrower scope focusing on vegetable dishes i plan to review her other books in the next few days highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in general,positive

this book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all you could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did book doesnt show you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them it also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn t even bother to read it before sending it to the presses it is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used,negative

i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it and being through with it now i feel as though i ve learned very little i had so many problems with this book or rather the way of writing mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author that this was a difficult read in his defense he is in most things very thorough my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was \( or as he sometimes put it must have been \) thinking or feeling while i give mr bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject in my opinion that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views since he himself stresses that leonardo s famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo s life the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter but only puts forward his own opinion and his reasons why he believes what he does without explaining the opposite side of the matter in this manner he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter sentences beginning with i think or in my view are not uncommon he also makes certain assumptions about the reader referring often to other artists works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them also he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo s often drawing attention to coloring or texture without ever showing it though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout the author is an undoubtedly intelligent well learned man very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned but entirely overbearing in his writing overall unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and don t mind being pulled out of a book by the author s views then i would highly suggest staying away from this one,negative
i clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here who will all have to forgive me for thinking that susan cooper s the dark is rising is plain awful this book was recommended to harry potter fans who have run out of hp books to read i must say it was a waste of my time to read dark never have i read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero in this case we are told that on his 11th birthday an english boy named will stanton discovers he is the last of the old ones unlike jk rowling who in the first pages of harry potter the philosopher s \( or sorcerer s \) stone provides the reader with a vivid description of harry as skinny with an unruly mop of black hair startlingly green eyes and of course a lightning bolt scar on his forehead cooper does not describe will stanton at all the result is that the reader after having read 244 pages still cannot visualize what will looks like i also find quite annoying cooper s approach to this good vs evil tale she is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are the old ones and who or what exactly is the dark as for the dark being evil all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that the dark means cold snow and of course darkness excuse me but is this the best cooper can do is this what this book is about the druid pagan worldview of light vs dark summer vs winter warmth vs cold what happened to the conception of evil as moral evil,negative

i am leading a christian study group using popular films i was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some scriptural truth unfortunately the author was much less interested in a christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the church i know that churches have problems and hurt people but it is not as common as this author seems to assert he seems very angry at the church \( and for some reason all of western culture especially america \) living in n ireland could make one suspicious of religion i assume but despite his claims to be a chrisitan so concerned about commmunity he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up it is a good study of film \( not movies he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person \) but not very useful in the context of the church that s my take anyway god bless,negative

i m on page 110 of this book the book has 220 pages i m half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person i am angry with i bought this book because i have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me but it is having the opposite affect i feel i was duped into buying it \( because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews \) part 1 tells us what a grievance is it tells us and tells us again and again and again the thing is i already know what a grievance is i know i m angry at someone and i know it s not healthy i know to forgive would help me i didn t need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages all that reading did was make me dwell and think more about the problem and increased my anger because of the book itself when i reached part 2 entitles forgiveness i thought finally but all part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction how great the study was and how much it will help me there are some great reviews of this book here at amazon and if this book helped some people that is great but so far i can t agree with any of the positive comments i have a great degree of respect for stanford university i went to high school across the street from stanford and have taken classes there but it pains me to have such a great school s name attached to this book is it fair of me to write a review of a book i have not finished no but i m afraid to continue reading it i m already angry and to buy a book that i thought would help me only to find it frustrating me i don t feel is not all that fair either,negative

a mind opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy and a degree in psychology \( although i m not giving up the meds just yet \) i m amazed by how clearly yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have the case histories he describes are priceless on the negative side yapko can be just a bit condescending at times it s clear he thinks his way is the only way and although he mentions other theories of depression he favors the nurture theory of ineffective learned thought patterns claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature \( maybe next lifetime he ll be a woman and get to experience menopause \) yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people depressives which is the kind of labeling we could do without the most serious criticism i have is that his learn by doing exercises are sometimes impractical if not downright silly for example to learn about perceived control yapko writes spend a few days asking a partner for permission to do everything such as can i go to the bathroom \( can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day \) other exercises tell you to interview at least a dozen people or sometime when you feel playful experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things like flying what depressed person feels playful many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person s capabilities especially those of us who are older and have physical disabilities however i do plan to complete the written exercises having outlined these minor drawbacks i have to say it s an excellent book after all these years i finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression,positive

i am a big fan of the missing manual series previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient i therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm office is such a gargantuan program with tons of bells and whistles that microsoft itself estimates that most users take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities however the book is a major disappointment because of its many mistakes and poor organization most of the mistakes are ones you can work around for example on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes a and b are reversed but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction every few pages i find myself going to the missing manuals web site to report yet more errata such as incomplete or wrong instructions figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions incomprehensible writing seeming confusion between the mac and pc versions of the program etc and i agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index it looks as though o reilly publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book but instead rushed it out as soon as possible that is too bad because i will now be much more hesitant to purchase another missing manuals title,negative
the book is obviously well researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting however the author included a lot of details that just really didn t matter as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book my professor was able to bring dr schrag to talk to our class he was a good lecturer keeping the class interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style i think he would have much more success as an author,negative

despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is not a computer crime novel in fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal in the first few pages we re introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she s gone and the book spirals into japanese gangs corrupt police horribly bland and indistinguishable characters and it just sucks from then on out the story is good albeit incorrectly marketed the characters however have no identity they all sound the same with the exception of the japanese characters sadly the book lacks serious writing talent very little character development on what could ve been a good story one positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of japanese culture etc are really good perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from england to japan my advice spend some time abroad again,negative

i did a course on quantum theory in the 1970s with john ward who was recommended for the nobel prize in 1965 \( feynman schwinger and tomogana shared it \) those close to the action will know of ward s identity john \( died in 2002 from memory \) used feynman s lectures as his course notes i must confess a soft spot for feynman i would have loved to have been in his lectures \( buy his audio tapes and you will get the feel for his delivery \) he was truly a great physics communicator and often understated his mathematical abilities \( after all he had won the putnam prize at some stage so he was no mathematical slouch \) his development of qed is simple to understand and that says it all about his genius he took the view that if he couldn t give a simple explanation then he really didn t understand the topic the current crop of tool polishers should heed this anyone who is really serious about physics \( and maths \) should read the original papers and this is a classic example i suggest that you fill in the gaps in the derivations if you can t do that then you haven t really understood it it is fascinating to compare feynman s approach with schwinger s more abstract approach i prefer feynman s but schwinger does a hugely impressive job in stripping qed down to its logical \( almost truth functional \) essentials buy this book and see how a first class mind works peter haggstrom bondi beach australia,positive
ironweed by william j kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i ve recently joined the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie \( at the group meeting \) that was based on the novel as i expected the movie paled in comparison to the book despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself jack nicholson plays the main character \( francis \) and meryl streep is his wanna be socialite girlfriend \( helen \) but this star power doesn t elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel set during the great depression ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society drunks homeless impoverished and in that regard the story is timeless i enjoyed the characters quirkiness and the loosely connected plots but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption forgiveness and love the love aspect may be hard to spot but it is there unconventionally in many of the character s interactions this favorable recommendation comes with a warning it can be a depressing read definitely not a happy one and while i found it inspirational it will not conjure any blithe emotions ironweed is definitely not a june beach read being more apropos to a long winter night indoor by a warm fire,positive

i got the impression that rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor it was superficial with such helpful hints as people come in all sizes and shapes and people with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly i didn t need to read her book to figure those out her logic is also flawed she states that doctors touch patients not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them not because of any power status using the book to promote her feminist beliefs numerous typographical errors and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer,negative
definitely a wonderful book for those following the teachings of the other books this book provides more useful information the path that castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views \( read the other reviews \) i found it useful to read and judge for myself what castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon thus the angry reviews of those calling castaneda a fraud due to their own failure its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own specialness jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book i believe castaneda s genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated i am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom,positive

all throughtout this book alex delaware and his police friend milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover they have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture the reader longs for the pair to actually do something in the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings that is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking i read and enjoyed several of the early alex delaware books and then quit looking for new ones now i know why,negative
i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years i was born raised in the north i think evans should rename his book fiddler on the roof in the south his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history as it was in the past here it s very much the southern jews were all so happy they all fit in and were accepted etc he does cite a few instances where they had problems but these usually involved us yankee jews like the instances when a few \( yankee \) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights evans should realize that times have really changed here the evangelical christians in my town \( which is most people here \) harrass me like crazy i am praying for you have you read the words of jesus who was a jew like you when will you come to my church blah blah blah thank god for the minority of catholics methodists presbyterians and a few others who live here they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am and the way i will stay a jew i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences and that they cannot relate to what i am saying but i do want to ask evans a few questions 1 \) if things are so great for the jews in the south why have you lived in new york for decades now 2 \) why don t you at least write either a new forward to the book a magazine article etc contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time \( for some of us at least \) primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians i read evans books before i moved here and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here for a jew who really cares about her his religion living here is depressing it is practically jew less and at best the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me \( by the way i am planning to move to a city \) by the way don t bother writing to me to tell me that i am wrong or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church believe me with all the praying for me that is going on in this town and all the myriad attempts to convert me if it hasn t happened by now as they say in these parts it just ain t gonna happen,negative
as always the latest compilation in this annual science fiction anthology remains one of the great anthologies as the current entries are top rate for the most part the thirty contributions are superb tales from a who s who of the genre especially fascinating is paul mcauley s creative entry the two dicks in which philip k dick writes mainstream fiction until he meets richard nixon other stories are well written as gardner dozier scores again with selections that run the gamut from alternative realties to artificial intelligence to animal intelligence that worms its way into the reader s mind the introduction by mr dozier provides a summation of the trends in the year which can be summarized as stable science fiction fans who appreciate shorts will devour this must reading that once again lives up to its title harriet klausner,positive
this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m a work i decided to read it i thought the book was excellent but maybe unnecessarily long the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job this book is a must for everyone else that just likes good non fiction this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era,positive

after reading all the author s books so far i realized he is repeating himself in all his books \( including the ones which myron bolitar isn t present \) there are the same elements in the plot disappeared person who might or not be dead mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot the hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved in the last minute someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot but no one knows for sure as the plots became being built upon the same structure the suprise is getting less and less after each book being someone who started liking mistery books after reading all agatha christie s ones and because each book of hers is completely diferent from the other i look for the same originality in other mistery books of course the book is good for a first time harlan coben reader i just didn t like it that much because of the repetitions which make very easy to guess the final spoiling the suspense of the reading,negative

this book is pitched at least in part to linux beginners but it fails in small maddening ways when speaking to this audience after a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install page 65 tells you to run the man command in a shell session it offers no clue that the only way to terminate a man command is the letter q a completely unintuitive action so a new user can flounder forever or at least until they get frustrated and reboot but i don t mean to slam just this book that same problem exists in most other beginning linux books even o reilly s pocket guide all these knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow magically gain access to information that the authors have in their heads but haven t committed to paper except for that it s a very good book,positive

i found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents i flipped though it and it looked dated but interesting so i decided to get it as other reviewers mention it is dated but you gotta know that up front when you get it it s published in 1986 when there were no \( well almost no \) home computers so you have to accept up front that it s talking about organizing papers using more papers but that s something we still all got to do occasionally so it s a system of notepads file folders etc it does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers etc and what you can do about it however it does get overly complex and really doesn t seem applicable in today s world where there are far fewer homemakers who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files as this book seems to be focused on finally i have to mention that it was the continual religion related references that put me off to the book in the end others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it but for me i felt i was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable just my personal taste i m sure some others will disagree with this judgement but i have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text i gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin,negative

the boston based author dennis lehane wrote a great detective story with a social background so great it is almost more important than the plot mystic river differs from lehane s other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer mystic river is set in the fictional boston suburb called east buckingham \( the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester \) home mostly to white working class with plenty of crime i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it knowing the area the first part which is the base and explanation for later events takes place in 1975 when one of the three eleven year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple smelling car and although he comes back after four days his life as well as his friends is changed forever the ways of the boys soon part dave \( the boy taken by the men \) lives a quiet life has a wife and a son and likes his memories of being a football player in high school jimmy the bad boy after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen year old daughter from his first marriage second wife and their two daughters the third boy college educated sean becomes a policeman when jimmy s beautiful daughter katie is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood sean gets assigned to the case there are many leads to different people but the case is difficult meanwhile jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own the plot is very good until the end and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate the characters are very real especially jimmy and sean who are central to the plot their trauma after dave s abduction made a lasting effect on their lives in very different ways they are complicated multifaceted people very well developed as literary characters some side protagonists depicting perhaps types rather than individuals \( bobby roman the savage brothers sergeant whitey \) are very good i was in the grasp of this book until the end it is not only great entertainment but also food for thought the movie based on mystic river with sean penn is equally moving recommended for those with little time,positive
though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology it s the dryest most aesthetically difficult to read textbook especially if you happen to be studying the material online through independent study the publisher needs to redesign the book and or you need to have a better online course professor it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material \( which is interesting in itself \) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction,negative
the venona secrets is a deceptive book it tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of soviet spying in the us but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing liberals than in painting a true portrait of their subject although the information the authors provide is interesting the biased and heavy handed way it s presented negates whatever scientific value it might have for example the authors insist that j robert oppenheimer was working for the soviets \( they call this a fact \) yet they present absolutely no proof that oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic naive man who couldn t keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of communism in america was money to the cpusa the book is full of these so called facts with little to nothing to back them up the authors praise joe mccarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti communist hysteria of the 1940 s and 1950 s ignoring the fact that mccarthy capitalized on fears of communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal mccarthy s methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by stalin are completely overlooked as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign the authors also praise senator henry jackson as some sort of all american crusader against communism not even mentioning that all of jackson s anti communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti semistism and hatred of blacks overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of liberal ideology one can simply hear the disdain for liberals dripping from the authors prose and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right wing propaganda who want an objective account of venona the authors have sacrificed their credibility for their conservative agenda they deserve not to be taken seriously,negative

first off i d like it better if we had 1 2 star options judas unchained really doesn t deserve a 2 more a 2 1 2 or 2 3 4 i have a love hate relationship with peter hamilton s books he s very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster than light society plausible but as with a lot of these hard science libertarian sf authors he badly needs an editor i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel pandora s star he also has far too many main characters who \( despite 800 pages \) never seem to come alive they all speak with essentially the same voice and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped 60s era hippies come on does anyone seriously say dude in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young \( or rejuvenated \) women hamilton s treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best on the one hand the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed represented and believable on the other hand the dynamics of the relationship between old timers and first lifers is unsatisfactory in four centuries for example no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty perhaps the commonwealth s continual expansion is the safety valve but even here the government \( controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties \) controls it another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn t change i mean the characters of a novel \( almost by definition \) are dynamic go get em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime the aliens are ok the problem with them \( and this is true of nearly every sf story \) is that they tend to be one dimensional they re all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up \( this is a problem in fantasy stories too \) on the plus side i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien deus ex machina ozzie s adventures in wonderland \( i e the silfen paths \) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn t really help anyone defeat the primes overall if you started with pandora s star you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained if you haven t started down this silfen path i recommend alistair reynolds tony daniel or iain banks they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date,negative

one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot s unfurtunate preducices but how come you don t say something like that about o henry we can t just stop reading authers because you we don t like their views someone calls hemingway looking forward if that s looking forward i de rather look backward hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past but towards what we have made out of the present in name of progress we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous the first draft according to one of eliot s biographers was absolutly a expression of relavtism one critic accused him being a nihilist on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe so it doesn t have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism we could use more of that yet what he doesn t right he evoces through mode and tone giving us truly one of the best poems of this or any other century,positive

i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also this book is filled with suspense from page one the book never drags in my opinion this book though is not for the faint of heart if you don t enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter but if you don t mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes the ending is by far the most suspenseful part i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn t i can t choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end keep up the good work king,positive

i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years however this book is misleading and dangerous almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem \( except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries \) writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust mr crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references to support this premise tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust i hope that someday mr crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people s thoughts and actions through his books there is a quote with great power comes great responsibility but in this case it would seem with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet,negative

i will not try to say that i asserted the painstaking analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of heidegger more than that i have no interest in doing so it is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being \( existence \) and my reading didn t lead me to any other conclusions so as i said i have no interest in reading this a second time further deeper or slower being and time is chock full of invented terminology to the extent that michael inwood was able to profit from his publication of a heidegger dictionary whatever you might think the word world means for instance is not what heidegger means and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so this is the case with his entire vocabulary if there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by heidegger i would not bring this up as a crticism beyond the unventilated severely sober and utterly uninspiring character of being in time i also call attention to the futility of it s project if heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him that there is no question of being why is the question of being so problematic because it is unanswerable maybe or if it is answerable we re not in any position to answer it being implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn t make sense and if you posit an idea that is so concrete so constant you can t just bend it to make it fit reality you ve already betrayed your questioning truth including the truth of being is a local phenomenon truth is not always and forever true it s true when it s true but heidegger wanted an everlasting truth a dogmatic anthropology worse than the general uselessness of his project and the toxic dregs left in his wake heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought provoking way,negative
this book should get 0 stars speaking as an artist myself the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics etc to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse admittedly i could not even finish this book after reading for the nth time a line of shaky circumstantial evidence like all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw but there are no correction marks therefore optics must have been used i could not even stand to keep reading on the contrary all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction that is just one example the book is filled with flaky examples such as those hockney claiming this is too good to have been done without optics or this was too difficult to have been done without optics and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art if that is indeed what he thinks and modern artists must remember this nowadays the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists for many reasons superior art education is very hard to find and there are many distractions in the modern world \( tv computers having to hold a day job lack of patrons etc \) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did therefore most will never attain the skill of the old masters but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology some of the other examples used as evidence refer to odd proportion perspective etc in otherwise masterful work i am surprised that this author \( and those readers who are artists \) apparently does not realize that throughout history great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism even nowadays photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists because after all we are artists not cameras the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality not to copy it therefore many inconsistencies in proportion perspective etc evident in old masters work are not oddities or mistakes but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition all that being said i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of trickery or technology of some sort instead an art student should be encouraged to build skill discipline and self reliance because that is the true secret of the great masters,negative
homesick my own story by jean fritz is a story about an american girl who grows up in china she spends a good part of her life wishing she could be in america where she belongs when she s not doing that she s corresponding with her grandmother trying to make friends with some young chinese children and learning british culture in school as you can see jean fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up however this story is an autobiography and is in almost no way fictional jean fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway though jean fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane ticket her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot or even understand the full story the autobiography is punctuated by emotions all in all this is a fine educational history text but is not in my opinion a fitting storybook,negative

this book is a personal re examination of food what we eat and why we eat it in this book prentice examines food customs and traditions searching for their physiological and environmental rationale her primary observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied to the seasons and thus the continual year round availability of our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge about what is good for us and what isn t in recognition of the essential seasonality of foods prentice organizes this book into the thirteen moons that make up the year from the famine moon to the sap moon from the egg moon to the corn moon from the blood moon to the wolf moon each chapter describes the ecology that led to the association between a particular food item and a specific time of the year in the chapters prentice discusses the nutritional contributions of the featured food items and how her relationship with that food has changed over the years for example she explains how she used to avoid milk and other dairy products but now relishes them as a gift of love from mother earth each chapter also includes recipes of the season ranging from exotic dishes of non western food cultures like cardamom and jaggery pudding to simple directions for lost arts such as rendering pork or making homemade yogurt and sauerkraut prentice was once a strict vegan who for health reasons eventually found herself drawn to a diet which includes animal products but not the products of industrial agriculture there is much that vegetarians and vegans would not like in prentice s essays since she explains how her 10 years of vegetarianism were not healthy for her having had the same experience myself after being a vegetarian for 20 years i can appreciate the wisdom in what she writes while vegetarian diets work well for some they are not appropriate for everybody but at the same time diets that include the consumption of industrially produced and processed animal products do nobody any good we need to be willing to recognize our relation and responsibilities to the animals that we consume i first heard of this book when i attended a vermont localvore potluck at which prentice was the invited guest chef i was deeply offended then at her attitude when she announced she was going to make a salad using a recipe from her book but lamented the lack of local artichokes or olive oil how could such a person be associated with local cooking i wondered if she doesn t even have the sense to find out what the best local ingredients are and celebrate them instead of parading the products of another region in front of us i figured that a seasonal local cookbook written by a national author would be a worthless concept fortunately that s not what this book attempts instead the book is much more about rediscovering our connection to food than about specific local recipes although she has become famous for leading the concept of eating foods only from one s local region what she urges here is really an appreciation for the products of small farms thus instead of simply cheering on local food prentice argues in this book that our industrial agriculture system has torn us away from one of the most essential of human traits our relationship to the food that nourishes us instead of following diets of avoidance prentice advocates recognizing the meaning that each item of food brings to our lives and using food to re establish our connection to the land indeed the only foods that prentice avoids are those heavily processed products of industrial agriculture refined sugar white flour and pre packaged extruded junk although the book contains a few recipes it is not a cookbook but rather a wake up call our poor diet is at least partly a physical manifestation of a spiritual decay together with some suggestions of how we can begin the journey back to healthy eating,positive

elaine pagels is a wonderful writer her explanation into early christianity is wonderful it is definitely worth the time to read this she delves into the politics of the early church the passion the resurrection as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking too often we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were read this,positive
those who condemn this book for not being a long boring list of name origins and meanings or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today s children are missing the point baby names now is a fun readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s including famous namesakes \( saints popes presidents royalty music and movie stars \) and what some celebrities have named their children it s also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style for example lisa amy susan and dawn were very popular for babies born in the 60s \( and thus my classmates \) but are rarely used today the book s major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire not just the first names at one point it reads harrison ford is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison s popularity excuse me ever hear of the beatles the entries for the name jordan don t mention michael jordan certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area the entry for jackson doesn t mention michael janet or samuel l the entry for landon doesn t mention michael the entries for cassidy don t mention david and shaun so popular in the 70s when many of today s moms were growing up the entry for lucas do i have to say it fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children and come on how can you mention the name wayne without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne still this is a lot of fun and i give the authors credit for recognizing that althea is from a grateful dead song i look forward to the next edition,positive
with someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome why dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of shakespeare s most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me it s not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it literally if you are looking to learn the solid fundementals of chemistry you should pass this one by and go with something like wiley s chemistry concepts and problems in which you begin learning immediately in a simple straightforward manner for anyone to suggest that a book like this should be part of any school s curriculum is just absurd,negative
i should first confess my bias i have often been tickled and sometimes awed by mortimer s way with english prose for 20 years so in picking up this book i had the high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or beloved teacher no disappointment even if some of these essays are slightly less effervescent than others all are at least wonderful and several are both brilliant and touching mortimer has given us a collection of short essays conversational and often wryly funny which he intends as a kind of spiritual bequeathal to his family and other heirs the chapters range across a broad range of subjects some perhaps outwardly frivolous like the cooking of eggs but in the main mortimer touches on matters of great substance the nature of beauty how to be happy surprising ways in which our world has managed to be unjust places and times for sex how to dine sociably the love of children faith and reason the terrors of the writer facing blank paper and many more i found these essays to be wise and absolutely delicious i suspect that readers who have enjoyed rumpole or mortimer s other biographical essays like summer of a doormouse or clinging to the wreckage will be quite pleased with these sketches mortimer may sadly be nearing the end of his life but at present he seems to be on a literary tear i for one wish him many more prolific years,positive
i ran into this book accidentally while doing some research instead of glancing through it i ended up reading the whole book i just couldn t put it off content wise the book doesn t bring me many light bumb moments however i find it extremely well written rhetorically while the book is easy to read it is literarily graceful i d suggest everyone to read it just to enjoy the beauty of language,positive

this is an excellent fascinating and insightful read dr guarneri knows her stuff and has writen this book well she wrote it because obviously we need to think about nutrition cholesterol and excercise but there are deeper issues too like peoples emotions she believes that heart problems can be caused by the stress s in our lives and our emotions we could litterally die of a broken heart emotional events can weaken heart muscles you produce stress hormones when you are upset which raise blood sugars and blood pressure etc which ultimately weaken or can destroy the heart she talks about this in the book and on the flip side talks about happy people too and how positive emotions and feelings do good for our hearts when we are happy our hearts beat in a coherent rythym she says we have to look at our hearts in various ways we need to look at it as a pump to keep us alive but to also look at the emotional heart the mental heart and the spiritual heart in order to keep us healthy i believe she knows her stuff and she wrote this well and has made it totally interesting and it s looking at our hearts in a different way from other books on the same subject if you have a healthy and happy outlook on life you will also have a happy and healthy heart,positive

i was interested in dante s thoughts on hell religion and the afterlife as taught by the catholic church at the time of its writing what i got was a detailed political history of medieval italy this book is great for the first few chapters but then it becomes a repetitive saga synopsis of the each chapter of the inferno go to next layer of hell describe in 20 words or less the torture found there make fun of some political opponents catholic church officials and so forth prepare for further descent in my opinion this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell canto three pretty much has it right leave all hope ye that enter,negative

i actually know where trieste was before i read this book unfortunately i have never visited the city i wanted to read this travel book about this famous city but after a few chapters i wondered where the book was going to after the final chapter i still do not know what the author s intentions was with this book perhaps i don t read too many travel books obviously the city means a lot to the author but she did not express it clearly in her writing i was scratching my head at the end and wondering what i read i learned a little about the city but not in relation to the amount of time i spent reading this short book the city of james joyce and maximillian the imperial port of the austo hungarian empire the meeting point of slav german and latin empires one of the ending points of the iron curtain this city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader i am sure the author s other books are good her last one was not the greatest,negative

i read this book on a suggestion from a friend before i read reviving ophelia because she wanted to see if i would be as dissapointed with it as she was i was more so while there are some outstanding essays in this collection the bias of the editor clearly stands out there is no one for the outcasts to relate to there was no musician nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion there were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had the sections are poorly named and divided all in all it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original some girls it may make feel less alone but for me it only accentuated the differences definately take out from the library before you buy it,negative
it is almost like dream comes true when i saw the revised new second edition out at the bookstore the imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor but has graciously added new updated materials in synthesis you may see it as an equivalent to jerry march s advanced organic chemistry but a whole different approach the sections on oxidations reductions and organoboranes are excellent since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like nicholaou s classics in total synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry,positive
just wanted to quickly say i haven t finished it yet i am only on page 20 but already this book seems very overrated the author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views instead he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate conclusive authority on spirituality and it s very aloof and actually not an enlightened approach at all i ve just started the chapter on karma and it s really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people s opinions clothed as quasi originality it looks like i m going to continue reading with a very cautious vetting attitude toward the text the fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness and how easily authors such as zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears hey that s the material world for you,negative
our attention is the most precious resource we have says shenk well i m not sure everyone would agree but this is the way he would like to slice the whole matter of information technology the media etc etc and that s fine shenk s standpoint is amazingly isolated and will make sense only to an elite ensconced in the same high fallutin mix of punditry technology leisure time he is information overload or data smog as the author terms it is certainly a relevant and important area to explore but shenk in is privileged world really can t nail down what might be so detrimental about it his examples illustrate just how removed his is from the vast majority of american society minute by minute news reports diluting the quality of info and the ability to sort it not feeling so apt to respond to your friends email because you get too much the end of patience as he represents it in the end of patience data smog really ain t no big woop it s just some tacks on the erogomic seats of a pampered minority into which shenk seems to fit where s the politics i wonder how does this trivia fit into the lives of middle americans or working people to the point shenk might benefit from a step or two away from his computer rubbing shoulders with the common folk might hip him to serious problems like acne or monday night football,negative
i love mysteries set in ww ii and like old time radio so i couldn t wait to begin this one the hero is a junior varsity tom joad but ok i was game the cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable baddies and goodies they were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and i pushed on then when we got to the jersey shore i found out that in 1942 with america fighting for it s life against fascism and losing our hero knew why all the servicemen were bullies \( a drafted station employee \) or morons \( the coast guard beach patrol \) the 4f hero was the real mccoy however although not actually mentioned i bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn t kept him from joining the abraham lincoln brigade he was moderate enought to think marxism had some problems the murder of 10s of millions of ukrainians and the nazi ussr pact probably and i say probably didn t elude our observant literary genius he was also a 1975 era feminist all those plucky ww ii women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support most big businessmen probably wearing spats and silk high hats were the bad guys needless to say i wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book i couldn t finish it and it s a point of honor for me to finish all books then in the bio it all became clear the author was a flack for former congresswoman pat schroeder of colorado i m still haunted by her rictus grin and constipated quaker schoolmarm expression that said somebody somewhere is having fun and i want it to stop now anyone who could stand to work for pat could write this book with ease,negative

this classic chronicle of presidential campaigns from the get go to contemporary times has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride or as a reference source reading this in the wake of monicagate and the florida recount it s instructive to read the history of grover cleveland who seems to have features of both past democratic candidates like clinton he had his scandals fathering an illegitimate child like gore his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost in a hotly contested knife edge electoral college tally,positive

i was rather disappointed in mr peterson s work he dwells much too long on trying to convince us of the problem nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload even after wading through the numbers and graphs i am still skeptical of his conclusions and would caution readers to do further research certainly the baby boomers are an aging bulge in the population of the us and will create some challenges however the author fails to mention the echo boom \( baby boomer s children which are equal in number \) and he glosses over the impact of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every year both of these facts will soften the impact of the gray doom that mr peterson tries to create i just don t anticipate the tremendous problem of which he tries to make us aware but i did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth control will have on our future another disappointment was very little discussion of aging trends and buying habits despite these shortcomings i enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and the impact of aging populations,negative
since i received this book i have been carting it around using it for reference ever since i wish that i had been introduced to this book sooner in my college career it sets a good foundation for the basics it is also good for sparking ideas if you are stuck robin williams also writes well making it a fun easy read \( like all her books \) i highly recommend this title,positive

i recently re read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival s performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder drawn from sir thomas north s 1579 english version of plutarch s lives william shakespeare \( 1552 1616 \) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career around 1607 and published it in the first folio in 1623 it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers roman military leader marc antony and the captivating queen of egypt \( and former mistress of julius caesar \) cleopatra when his wife fulvia unexpectedly dies antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister octavia of course this news enrages passionate cleopatra she vents her anger on the messenger but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty however antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra s arms abandoning his new wife in athens this leads to war when octavius declares war on egypt after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide which prompts antony to wound himself mortally antony dies in his lover s arms and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar \( octavius \) the heart broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs in the end antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next g merritt,positive
i was so disappointed in this book i don t find a closeness to god in the pages instead it seems intellectual it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek and though the author s prayers are included too i feel the same about them i expected more from richard j foster,negative
having read most of grisham s books i ve saved a few of his best for last while it wasn t a 5 star book like i d hoped it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one having saw the movie years ago i had a good idea of what the book was about two supreme court justices are killed a law school student along with many other people become curious and try to figure out who dun it only she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head and when the wrong people find out she s on the run for her life i enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast paced and had a lot of detail so much detail and characters i had a bit of a struggle to keep up of course it was suspenseful and the characters especially of darby the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth good read,positive

i m a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven but practices eclectically within my private practice i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian purportedly wicca s charm was written by an impartial writer immediately you realize that this isn t true catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders arguments instead i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched she relies on the writings of margot adler carol christ starhawk and phyllis curott \( with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton \) to draw many of her conclusions yet missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars merlin stone raymond buckland isaac bonewits patricia crowley and the matthews to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism s base of knowledge too often sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive in another case she bases her thesis that women s spirituality \( e g goddess worship \) is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9 11 sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind a fair request but as you re reading closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul,negative

first off i d like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i ve ever read jedi search being the first i actually liked the first book it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read however this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it \( be warned this may contain a few spoilers \) thusly how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions it reminds me of a little britain sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space i don t mind the story being 20 odd pages shorter if it comes to the point for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to ground the story by constantly relating to the star wars films for example when wedge and the scientist go to that forest resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there he says something along the lines of i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca little did i know the brush i had with history there gahhhhhhh why how did he know it didn t need it bangs head on desk he does this throughout the two books i ve read so far how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without proving that it s true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films then there s admiral daala made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking so what is she doing in this she s reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing it s only the end of the second book and she s down to 1 star destroyer she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens \( i e the rebellion win \) he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea that of having a jedi academy \( the point of the trilogy \) there s so much that could have been done here new and original training for the jedi but no he has the jedi go two by two into the forest \( holding hands \) to sense things it s meant to be a sci fi series something could have been done to make this so much better i was incensed to find that luke was actually made boring in this book part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown it all started very promisingly in the first book having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever \( cool i thought \) it got to the stage where i d dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull the other trainee jedi needed serious character development \( they were 1 dimensional \) entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn t good enough as other reviewers have said one of his students goes rogue somehow gains the knowledge of building a super lightsabre \( great idea btw we need more of that \) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters and luke just meditates about it grr okay all that being said it was okay and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book \( it s like a car accident you ve just got to look \),negative
a well crafted comprehensive look at the role of islam in turkey the book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that turkey has experienced since the 1980s specifically the author mentions the role of opportunity spaces in the evolution of islamic movements and ideas as a result of economic and political liberalization i think anyone who is interested in turkey islamic movements and the relationship between islam and modernity would get a great deal out of this book,positive
this author has written kitchen table wisdom which was recommended to me a year ago by my doctor ms remen remembers her zayde who died whe she was 7 and tells us all the wonderful things he taught her she is a physician and therapist and combines the lessons she learned at age 7 with her professional knowledge i love this book and find myself returning to it time and time again to re read the stories of strength refuge and belonging this book is much more than chicken soup it is chicken soup with matzo balls,positive
this is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860 s narrated by a civil war deserter within the first few pages our hero enlists pilfers letters off battlefield corpses deserts is injured in nyc draft riots ends up in new bedford ma and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going the book was downhill from there page after page described ice and the crew s interminable struggles to get through getting through the book was nearly as interminable the reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him or really understand him at all thus his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles there are elements of fantasy in the book not enough to make it a fantasy but enough to steer a reader off course the scientist on the mission is after a warm garden of eden in the middle of the arctic he is mad or it s fantasy it is hard to know until the end there is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands \( the most likeable character in the book \) describes how he got his third hand from that yarn comes the title rope eater the title really has nothing to do with the book other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain besides the tedious turning of the plot the characters lack any development only the three handed man and the captain both tangential characters had any depth whatsoever this book seemed to be an attempt at adventure but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension it never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters mentally and physically it just happened although the reader knew the characters must be suffering it never came through the over writing as one might expect the crew s mission to find the warm garden of eden in the arctic was pointless so was this book it was a disappointment,negative
i must say i enjoyed the book but the ending was so sudden with so many things left hanging that i was disappointed i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up how did manderly catch fire what did they do when they got to the burning house and how did they pick up their lives all we had at the ending was ashes also the narrator who never gives her name was sometimes very odd hiding behind doors in her own home sneaking food hiding behind chairs the book is worth reading but i wish that instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea du maurier had written a better ending,negative

i am at the mid point of the book and will likely post another review when i am done the authors give the history and motivation and design decisions behind hla they also give many good examples allow you to get a really good feel for the important concepts of hla by running an actual federation one thing i will be looking for is the impact of the architecture on simulation performance scalability in practice \( as opposed to in theory \) and how is hla likely to evolve over the next couple decades i don t know yet whether the book is enough for you to create your first federation if you really have no background at all in simulation you will still get a lot out of the first couple of chapters plus the many references to articles written on the subject but don t expect to find the other chapters easy using my background in simulation systems i can say that hla seems to have been very well thought out based on real life simulation systems and is therefore not trivial but that s what makes it interesting and the book so far lives up to that,positive
practical sage advice from stanley not as good as his follow up the millionaire mind this book is somewhat pedantic it also suffers from the fact it s extremely dry the author s writing is much more engaging in his followup and that s a much faster read in addition to offering some practical tips the millionaire next door also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry s money secrets a book called maybe life s just not that into you and something from andy borowitz the name of which escapes me if you have to choose between the millionaire next door and the millionaire mind go with the latter,positive
this book provides excellent information about what rheumatoid arthritis is how to distinguish it from osteoarthritis etc however i don t want to live with ra i want to recover from it as such this book offers no help in this regard it tells me about drugs that i can take and splints that i can wear to help me from becoming completely disabled but offers me no hope of recovery in contrast the book conquering arthritis by barbara allan is the well researched account of someone who took charge of their health and fought to recover from the disease to get their life back and succeeded i m well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book now that s a book well worth spending your money on,negative
i am a fan of tanya huff and the series of books with henry and victoria but this one is not it while henry is there he is such a minor character the main character is tony foster a homosexual street kid who tanya should have left on the street i was totally bored and read the book through because i was hoping it would get better then i was happy when it was over the plot idea was great but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more i was expecting henry to be a major player like he was with victoria but no he is relegated to tony s homosexual vampire lover who helps tony out disappointing dull i won t read the rest of this series the tony foster series hey tanya how about a series of henry fitzroy i would read that,negative
the theory behind this important collection of essays is that the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms these essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well each essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and thirteenth century europe at issue in each are the questions of what or who held the power to command or punish and how that power was obtained kept and manifested this is a truly enlightening book of particular interest are the essays on holding power over the truth as well as those dealing the formation of the nobility into a self consciously chivalric warrior class however all the essays are intelligent and useful explorations into the very nature and meaning of power ultimately this book must be considered essential for any serious student of history casual or academic,positive
this was the first vi warshawski book i ever read and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more i think paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into vi s world which is rich with unique characters vi comes across as individualistic and principled and i like how paretsky resisted clich temptation on several counts the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book and there is no obligatory sex scene not that sex scenes don t have their places but i just hate it when i m reading along and i can almost hear the agent say okay author you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book in this story vi is all business which is a delightful change of pace,positive
it took two people to write this book i was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40 something reader but this book really was a waste of my time you can see the ending a mile away for one but that didn t really bother me it was the writing the main character suffers from a syndrome that s unfortunately common to chick lit heroines which is to speak in an overly quippy aren t i clever with my snappy dialog way nearly every one of her sentences included a quip joke \( or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke \) real people just don t talk that way and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her by the way my copy had the first chapter of these authors next book attached at the end and they ve basically created the same two main characters the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend i won t bother with it,negative

it s a bad idea to create a character driven sci fi when your characters are this annoying the majority of children of the mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about the characters are so one dimensional and predictable that you already know what they ll say before they say it peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person novinha is as crazy and hard headed as she s been for the last two books and ender spouts off a bunch of trite up with people garbage every chance he gets somehow card even managed to make jane more irritating than my ex girlfriend during pms the only decent characters in this book are miro and wang mu and they aren t nearly enough to save the story i admit it i only made it a little over half way through children of the mind i couldn t take the dialogue anymore that s not to mention the ridiculous plot which centers on two children warping around the universe engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of japanese and polynesian culture in an attempt to avert a war between species if you re that curious to learn how the ender quartet concludes do what i should ve done from the beginning find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage,negative

with relations between the west and the islamic world worsening rapidly a better understanding of islam and its roots is badly needed in the west one major barrier between understanding islamic culture is the key sacred text the q uran has been little studied in the west and until recently good translations were unavailable many qurans were translated into the same sort of english as the king james bible and not a glint of the quran s revevered poetic beauty was reflected in such translations thankfully better translations in modern english are being made by leading islamic scholars who have a more sensitive ear to the poetry of the quran as well as a better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has for believing muslims like all great works of literature especially a poetic one like the quran its power and beauty can only be appreciated in its original language this is why muslims often say the quran is untranslateable but when one hears a verse of the quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of arabic the beauty \( while unfortunately not fully understandable \) does start to become apparent but even in translation when read carefully the quran still has great beauty from a literary viewpoint the most beautiful part of the quran in my view is the light surah which compares god to a light whose glory fills the entire cosmos this surah has been a favourite with sufis islamic theologians like al ghazzali and also muslim philosophers as well while the quran does contain descriptions of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the westerner it is important to study this work with patience and try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented jumble of poems it is in this sense the deep underlying unity of the quran and its theology \( which reflects the unity of allah the divinity in islam \) becomes apparent especially in the names of god a good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming indispensible in a world where islam is becoming more important to understand from a global perspective,positive

addressing as it does issues of cognition language usage and acquisition evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time it is very readable for the most part although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going more illustrations would have helped here there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage pinker s lively humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting then list a few more then add i could not resist some more and so on i sometimes wished he would just get on with it a major problem with his nativist approach which other reviewers have commented on is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book linguists have been busy recording them in the field the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter where he argues that you and i and you and me are equally correct in all circumstances because the pronoun is free to have any case it wants but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about if between you and i sounds instinctively wrong to me and between you and me sounds instinctively wrong to someone else does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene i doubt it the title itself is problematic instinct is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense early in the book pinker admits as much but determines to use the word anyway a use that owes more to marketing than to science still this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available if you are new to linguistics start here rather than with chomsky but please go on to read geoffrey sampson s work perhaps starting with his website to get an alternative view as with most academic disputes the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle since chomsky s early work the nativists have toned down their claims considerably while their opponents have made concessions on page 34 of this book pinker says no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene but the search is on more than a decade later the search is still on good luck with that,positive
this commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of romans romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the bible and john stoot does a good job of unpacking it the book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the scriptures it is probably not considered a highly scholarly work but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either,positive

another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species or perhaps a more apt ocean related metaphor would be comparing malkin s work to that of the brainless bivalves that cluster around sewer outflows or the mindless jellyfish who flow with the ocean currents but like the ocean neo cons writings should be taken with more than a grain of salt by the way the reviewer below who wants someone named mccracken reported to amazon i m sure you can take it instead why don t you campaign for a zero star feature for reviews or perhaps a fact checking service for publishers of political vitriol like this work of fiction i sure hope no public money has been spent on stuff like this,negative
murky in his book 1984 orwell described a contrived language he called newspeak designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible but before orwell there were russell and whitehead who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence as whitehead wrote in his foreword to quine s ph d dissertation titled a system of logic logic shapes metaphysical thought thus in his on universals quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as entities and he co authored with goodman steps toward a constructive nominalism a nominalist manifesto in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or platonists depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities i believe that anyone who says that universals are referenced or who uses the phrase abstract entities fully deserves to be labeled a platonist but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak in the search inside this book screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting \( p 20 \) that realists say universals are shared entities and are referents of predicates i ask loux what happened to signification the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense \( i e signification \) as well as denotation \( i e reference \) in the functional \( i e predicate \) calculus i ask loux what happened to supposition which distinguishes reference from signification in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions \( i e significations \) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization \( i e reference \) and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects i ask loux since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric i see murky writing muddled loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine the pragmatic realist who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing ontological relativity started as an analogy quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton s absolute time and he rejected lorentz s making relativistic time apparent time likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory s positing of duality and indeterminacy today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition nonlocality and calabi yau spaces in eleven dimensions quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs realism is a natural primordial irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity anti realism in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change i do not find this book contemporary loux s realism anti realism locution is a false dichotomy i see muddled thinking marginalized while a student i found notre dame s philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site thomas j hicke,negative
the advice in this book is solid and appropriate for most kids however the writer s attitude is judgmental if you are buying this book it s probably because your child s eating has not gone as smoothly as you d like for most of us a lot of our parental self esteem is wrapped up in this issue so it just makes no sense to act as if it s usually the parent s fault why alienate and beat up your target audience plus while i m sure that some parents contribute to kids eating issues plenty of kids are just born more sensitive if you can read between the lines and get to the take home message without letting her attitude get to you more power to you otherwise go elsewhere,negative
from a sociological perspective hustlers beats and others serves what it set out to do explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time however with the recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society many of his observations and conclusions are dated if not false te book just goes to many places crime pornography etc and fails what it set out to originally acomplish furthermore i find it quite unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards is this not a sociological perspective or an historical editorial as a college student and a sociology major the author fails to win my support from his argument all in all quite disapointing as i found it at my local bookstore and the cover looked interesting i was left with a feeling of disappointment when i finished this book as it completely crushed many of the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture of billiards stick with the sociology cut the editoria,negative

paul ehrlich may understand butterflies more than most of us do but he definitely does not understand how the real world in general and the human society in particular works he just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells to think realistically about the world this book starts with the bold statement that he had understood the population explosion for quite some time nevertheless the whole book proves that it s not the case all his reasoning is based on the worst possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable short term trend his assumptions therefore include the intelligent assumption that there won t ever be any technological progress in the future the climate will evolve in the worst possible way and so forth it s not surprising that he predicted that there would be mass starvation in the u s in the 1980s and even when this was shown to be complete nonsense he repeated the same prediction for the 1990s why does he and people like him continue to produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by the actual course of history it s because of their religion maybe they don t call it a religion but it is a religion nevertheless jehovah s witnesses typically believe that there is going to be a judgement day because it did not occur in 1918 and other years for which it was predicted they are a bit more careful and vague in their predictions nowadays malthus had done very similar errors as ehrlich but you may think that in the 20th century people could know more than malthus knew many years ago but ehrlich does not know more in some sense even karl marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic predictions marx predicted that something wrong would occur with capitalism as such and it would be globally replaced by communism \( this is what i call a truly catastrophic prediction \) marx was wrong of course because he completely misunderstood the magic power of the society and of the market to improve things that need to be improved and its ability to self regulate and accomodate to new conditions ehrlich is repeating all errors of marx and many other errors too but other people who have a different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be approaching a judgement day can t learn from jehovah s witnesses mistakes of course that paul ehrlich s reasoning has nothing to do with rational approach to important questions \( bjorn lomborg may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar questions namely these speculative questions about the long term food problems rationally \) ehrlich confuses the total amount of food available today and the total production of food he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can increase much like the population or even more he does not understand that the growth of the population in the developed world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed children and so forth he just does not understand the invisible hand of free markets and the visible hand of scientific and technologica progress and the power of human decisions his reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he simply tried to make similar predictions about the past but it was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the future his goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress many people who are not exactly smart the similarity between ehrlich s predictions of mass starvation and the recent predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a superficial coincidence find the book boiling point by ross gelbspan at this website one of the silly recent books about the climate change disasters that expect us among the 15 mostly positive reviews of the book you will also find a 5 star review by paul ehrlich of stanford himself the global warming alarmists continue with the traditions of paul ehrlich it is still the same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things the universe and human stupidity and i am not sure about the universe,negative
this is the best invertebrate zoology textbook on the market perhaps the best ever written the authors are not content to merely present in fine detail the classification anatomy physiology behavior and ecology of invertebrates they present alternative interpretations and controversial opinions where these topics are concerned in that way invertebrate zoology comes alive as an active important and relevant field of study for understanding the ecology and evolutionary relationships of these organisms in a global setting i highly recommend this book for a course of study or as a reference for earth science instructors who wish to solidify and deepend their knowledge and understanding of invertebrates,positive

what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes but no one seems to believe you that is the concept facing dr thomas more distant relation to the famous infamous saint thomas more in walker percy s novel love in the ruins the united states is at a time of crisis but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them it is up to dr more who knows how to diagnose the problem but not necessarily treat it to try to prevent the chaos from happening the story begins on a hot fourth of july with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days tracing doc s journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer a sort of stethoscope of the human spirit through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person s soul and finally discovers how to treat it meanwhile there is a revolution brewing the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed if a major catastrophe doesn t befall everyone before that can happen love in the ruins is a truly southern novel crafted through percy s intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o connor the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding even though they are frighteningly realistic and not so far fetched in this present day percy s hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway flawed prone to drink forever chasing after women who are wrong for him this novel is his coming of age in a sense because doc learns what it is he wants out of life and how to best achieve that subtitled the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world love in the ruins is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near apocalyptic america,positive

these mysteries are cozy and interesting and good they are perfect i could not ask for a better mystery not only is the setting and atmosphere cozy but the clues story line and pacing are perfect this author definitely has talent the clues are perfectly and cleverly crafted and lead to the mystery solving and the characters you feel like you know them i love this small town and all the characters not just the main characters but the other characters have purpose and meaning in this book hannah opened up a cookie shop with the encouragement of her sister andrea hannah finds the milk truck delivery driver dead in his truck she is determined to find out why he was murdered i also loved the cookies and coffee and cold weather and i enjoyed the sisters relationship,positive
i enjoyed the parts regarding the s s valiant but the later part of the book simply didn t work for me except for picard who we of course know quite well from the series the other characters were flat and uninteresting we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy of the week boring the whole adversarial situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard,negative
i read this book even before it was assigned to my undergrad psychology class and then i read it again and enjoyed it both times de wall does protest too much he s clearly answering his critics throughout but i found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing more importantly de wall s arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive \( not that i needed much persuading \) and his use of anecdotes keep the book entertaining i m looking at my pet pooches in a whole new way these days,positive
i wish i could give this book four and a half stars instead of four i can t quite justify five stars in my mind two of the stories were definitely good the first masked riders by parhelion and the third ricochet by ba tortuga i enjoyed both but was not particularly snowed by the intensity of the conflict plot line or the main characters and their relationships not so the second story hung up by cat kane was a powerful intense and moving story about two delightful yet flawed characters who had secrets that tore their relationship up until they were able to work their ways \( separately \) around the issues that story deserved a five stars plus rating and i wish kane would turn it into a full length novel and develop the characters and their backgrounds more this book is an excellent read both for the plot line and the erotic substance enjoy,positive
i love heinlein i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction i find that his plots and ideas are inventive even this story was inventive in many ways like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters however i found this book as a whole to be very boring much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters the main characters of each section of the book aren t fully realized at all i wouldn t recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really really bored,negative
this is a terrific cookbook even for people like me who are not trained bakers i have succeeded in making three recipes already they work great have a long way to go to try a lot of other really inviting recipes her book also serves as a great reference for anything chocolate i was quite impressed with the fact that ms lonbotham pays an historical homage to chocolate decadence \( page 42 \) as being a seminal contribution to chocolate lovers worldwide living in berkeley at the time i well remember what a sensatation it caused,positive
has there ever been anyone like richard nixon for sheer resiliency he stands alone in american history no one won bigger than richard nixon and no one lost bigger than richard nixon and then won again and then lost and won again he just kept punching and planning and working to eventually become one of the dominant figures of the 20th century the author of 9 books 8 of them best sellers this is his first and covers six major crises of his political life to 1962 this is serious history but so well written that it reads like an exciting novel in it you can see the raw steel of the man emerging through his discipline beginnig with his first crisis as a 35 year old freshman congressman the prosecution of alger hiss the darling of east coast liberals and the state department as a soviet spy the other crises have been well described by other reviewers but all were thrilling examples of courage \( backed by preparation \) under fire highly experienced washington veteran david gergen who worked closely with four presidents in his excellent book eyewitness to history described richard nixon as the toughest man i ever knew in this book you can see why interestingly his overwhelming love of country shines through as well for example the 1960 election was unbelievably close a swing of only 11 000 votes properly distributed and the election results would have been reversed and there was verifiable vote fraud by the democrats especially in texas and illinois nixon was repeatedly urged to demand an investigation and recount he refused first it would have greatly delayed the transference of responsiblity to a new administration but secondly as he wrote then too the bitterness that would be engendered by such a maneuver on my part would in my opinion have done incalculable and lasting damage throughout the country there speaks a patriot and a man also recommnended nixon in winter by monica crowley,positive
i ve been following the alex cross series from its beginning and after reading cat mouse i m wondering if patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more cross books written subsequently to this one i can only hope that the series gets better my complains are similar to those of other reviewers 1 i m getting sick of the perfection of alex cross the man s a saintly father saintly grandson saintly lover saintly charity worker and saintly detective these traits hooked the reader and made cross an intriguing character but he s fast becoming too one dimensional 2 the cross sampson relationship as if we weren t sick enough of this already every few chapters we re reminded of the man crush cross and sampson have on each other sampson is so perfect in cross s eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time sampson enters a scene 3 the cross christine johnson relationship moves way too fast one moment christine is still mourning the loss of her husband \( who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in jack jill \) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date and the next she and cross are madly in love no development whatsoever no line from point a to point b 4 i m not sure patterson could have written the dialogue between cross and his children any more unrealistically aren t these 7 and 9 year old children he has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with sampson or kyle craig 5 the entire novel is a series of pseudo climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field the soneji resolution was anti climactic at best and the mr smith conclusion was unfulfilling,negative
as a certified information systems security professional i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here and i m at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle an integrated approach to security in the organization the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques it doesn t seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half hearted integration,negative

once again larry mcmurtry delivers the goods in this tale of the old west we are introduced to calamity jane who spends a lot of time writing letters to her daughter by the light of a campfire calamity jane joins a western touring company and the sea voyage to america is particularly memorable there is also another character worth mentioning namely a native american called no ears who views the world in terms of deep philosophical thought towards the end of the book we see calamity jane lamenting her lost youth and sadly reflects on the glory days of the old west that she was once a part of larry mcmurtry has writen a fine novel with a real believable female character which is something most writers in this genre are unable to accomplish another wondrous tale from a master of his craft,positive
a favourite writer goes to prison keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read then upon his release writes the worst book of his career the concept of the book is good as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9 11 tragedy the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9 11 grounding of air traffic the idea that new yorkers wouldn t know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable while there is a direct highway to montreal archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive once at the border the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly doesn t know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero the guard then remarks that he will meet a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us canadian border crossings with multi lane checkpoints 24 7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness dan cormie,negative

the late carl sagan was one of the most popular influential and successful interpreters of astronomy to the american public in 1973 he published the cosmic connection he offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science inspiring a generation of scientists and non specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general and astronomy in particular now cambridge university press has reissued a new edition of sagan s influential book enhanced with freeman dyson s commentary on sagan s vision and on the importance of the cosmic connection ann dryan s assessment of sagan s cultural significance as a champion of science and david morrison s discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of sagan s predictions carl sagan s cosmic connection is must reading for all sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,positive

i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be,negative
when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith i ordered it the same day after all we seemed to be following the same path i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several firsts in the area of gene cloning then i found christ as a 40 year old my transition was from a semi serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian hearing about dr collins spiritual walk had me intrigued his book should be entitled a politician presents evidence for belief it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research the human genome project is elevated to status of bridge to a momentous new era hogwash hype is the term i would use the dept of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources the author couldn t make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more junk dna than previously thought dr collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school this is not entirely his fault however since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn t perfectly gradual and perfectly random their motivation should be perfectly obvious but it s not even on dr collins radar he also uses mendel s peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel s data was dry labbed usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology dr collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology st augustine and c s lewis i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a lyrical and allegorical flavor i would include the book of jonah in that category as well however there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked the only time dr collins makes a strong case for anything it is to refute edward o wilson richard dawkins and their minions even then he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism francis collins is the consummate politician he takes a stand without offending anyone dr collins knows that jesus was not a politician and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time take this quote from mat 23 14 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation dr collins book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists in my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth,negative
let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy after reading this book i now think he is one step above slime to be fair some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing he is anti pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o donnell michael moore barney frank barbara streisand and that fat girl from the dixie chicks among others no problem there in my opinion that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book the rest is just babble often repeated over and over again that even larry lovers will find annoying a couple things that really bothered me the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of retards and down s syndrome children he must use the term retard at least fifty times in the book this is appreciably different than making a joke about say michael moore moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes the down s syndrome children did not my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on retards he also racially sterotypes in the book many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond the down s syndrome kids can t larry i can only hope god \( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book \) grants you a retard child to love and care for then i would like to read your next book i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses he plays the good ol bubba he ain t too bright and he ain t ever changed since he left the farm his celebrity his word not mine has not gone to his head ok larry why then the better than thou tone throughout the book including speeches and lectures including serious topics such as abortion why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down why the unrelenting references to your celebrity the terms meet and greet and after party were used over and over and over as an example do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are well you are wrong they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become that s hollywood speak my country fart loving nose picking friend overall this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron \( see doesn t that sound better than retard \) my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people those who are dumb and know they are dumb and those who are dumb but are so dumb they don t realize it the former category usually shuts up \( knowing they are dumb \) the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter the first group is obviously smarter than the second larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book make jokes larry and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like unfortunately larry can t see the obvious like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book he has become exactly one of them a thin layer of good ol boy on top covering a core of venom and celebrity he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets my suggestion don t buy larry s act and by all means don t buy the book,negative

watson and crick pilfered the data of rosalind franklin \( unbeknownst to her \) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double helix nature of dna instead of acknowledging her with praise watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working \( ie a woman working in male dominated science n the 1950 s \) a classic case of reaction formation maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships,negative
i read bill bryson s a walk in the woods and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated \( for the educated aspect bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents \) i started into in a sunburned country with similar expectations and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the land down under my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson s book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia \( senility be merciful and consume me hastily \) my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a 350 page book about australia during and or after his trip his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a story relayed second hand from one of the australians he met such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents these at least provided for some interesting reading after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson s books \( i m a stranger here myself \) after she read a walk in the woods it would appear that in a sunburned country is not the only snore fest that bryson has churned out perhaps he isn t a one hit wonder but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out so if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in a walk in the woods look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed,negative
this book styron s finest is about redemption heralded by the epigraph from john donne the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it s impossible to put down but it s also to styron s great credit that the novel s theme redemption through confrontation with death and violence is reflected through its feverish style there are not many books in the postwar era and none in the united states that have such a non moralistic but intensely moral character and impact echoes of the greek tragedians \( several times evoked in the text \) and of dostoyevski abound finally the crucial role by the most fleshed out non expatriate character a philosophical italian small town cop named luigi elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers don t even seem to understand let alone approach it s a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet,positive

the other boleyn girl and the queen s fool are two of the best books i ve ever read and i ve read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin s lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it s channeled from another source and times when it s harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i m going back to trollope,negative

we have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate computing engineering and systems program \( university of los andes colombia \) there are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one \( e g people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs \) however to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded when other reviewers give 1 star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not occur this presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis in chapter 8 you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic sums and logical quantifications are for example treated in an uniform way maybe the type concept is not so fine explained but one has to remember that this is an introductory book 5 stars of course,positive
his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world and that the united states is already an empire but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life thus we get distracted too easily from important events overseas and when we do try to intervene we want quick fixes and low costs i couldn t agree more with most of these points as an american i m greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map also the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions countless times i believe america has done more harm than good by if you will talking the talk but not walking the walk if we commit to something we need to follow through this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past we ve claimed to support democracy in latin america but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam s suffering without changing the end result at all with all this commonality however there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i can t bring myself to agree with basically he didn t sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone won t our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts when ferguson hold s up the british empire as a model of success i can t help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism japan and germany were already highly developed before world war ii so it probably wasn t that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state even if the positive power of empire is conceded there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now it s a concern of immunity from repercussions in the golden age of imperialism europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires not to say that there were no reprercussions but with the only modern navies in the world europe was immune to any very serious threats on the other hand in today s world as an effect of globalization power has become more decentralized in some respects think wmds terrorists and foreign investments in the u s economy for example can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could in the end colossus didn t settle any agruments for me but raised new and interesting questions it is a book that makes you think and that in and of itself is worth four stars,positive

minus several million for good thinking zaphod beeblebrox the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy the above quote \( and the score i ve assigned to this book \) aren t in reference to the text or the author but to the publishers why anyone with the brains of a sea urchin would cross professor hawking as they seem to have done is beyond me briefly save your money and buy the illustrated brief history of time instead of the theory of everything even if you re a compulsive hawking completist alert readers should notice that hawking doesn t hold the copyright for theory of everything and attempted to block its publication it was originally titled the cambridge lectures life works and appears to have been drawn from some recordings of lectures given by the professor years ago \( see the professor s web site for details \) the vanilla \( i e not the illustrated \) theory of everything consists of an introduction seven lectures and an index without any illustrations or diagrams out of curiosity i compared a library copy of it with the illustrated brief history of time unless otherwise noted each of the 7 lectures corresponds to a chapter of the same name in brief history in some segments only with slightly different paragraphing and punctuation \( and occasionally the kind of spelling errors that creep in when one transcribes audio narration to text if i may speculate as to the cause \) i don t understand why anyone would prefer the less polished text of theory of everything to the illustrated brief history of time which not only has updates for new areas of research but has been revised and rearranged to explain things more gently to the layperson ideas about the universe is essentially an extract from our picture of the universe the first chapter of brief history with about one sentence s worth of drift per paragraph brief history s version of the expanding universe has a more gradual introduction to the methods of measuring distances to nearby stars and explains technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the non scientist such as luminosity theory of everything really shows its age in black holes when compared to brief history as hawking has not been idle in that area over the years the illustrated edition of brief history has had a fair bit of interesting material added to black holes especially regarding cosmic censorship and naked singularities \( hawking having made a few more bets on the subject with preskill and thorne although he paid off the cygnus x 1 wager \) black holes ain t so black lacks major blocks of clarification explanation added by hawking to the version in brief history brief history s version of the origin and fate of the universe goes into more detail about the kinds of particles that are predicted to have come out of the big bang and what sort of results we d expect to see today if the predictions hold and the scientists who first put forward these theories brief history also contains a much longer version of the open questions section leading more gradually up to the discussion of guth s development of the inflationary model the direction of time corresponds to brief history s the arrow of time \( which is worth picking up just for the picture of the keeper of the u s cesium clock \) brief history goes into more detailed examples to explain what hawking means by the psychological arrow of time with the simplest kind of computer an abacus the theory of everything mainly corresponds to brief history s more modestly titled the unification of physics which is much more up to date \( string theories are still covered but a lot more work has been done in that area over the years \) the tail end of the lecture corresponds to the ending of brief history s conclusion in summary this is interesting stuff but the illustrated brief history of time does it better,negative
i couldn t count how many copies of this book i have purchased the most recent was for my third grandchild due later this month this book is the best there is for the very young child for each of my own three children it was a stand out favorite that was read over and over until overuse required it be replaced we certainly couldn t be without a copy since then this book is always included whenever i give gifts to new parents the book is the touchy feely type so the child explores the soft fur of the bunny daddy s scratchy beard etc the only times i hesitated buying it for a new baby was once when the mom was unwed and the father was not involved with her or the child \( there is a page on daddy s beard and one for mother s ring \) and another time for a family of color since parents in the book are caucasian,positive
i had never read a danielle steel book before and decided to give her a try given that she is so popular and has so many books published i was pretty disappointed i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic however if a book is unrealistic but well written and engaging i would still like it i think the biggest problem with this book is the author s excessive repetitiveness yes i get that this character is really cold and unloving that was already covered 50 pages ago in addition character traits could have been better conveyed through situations rather than simply stating so and so was a devoted mother and repeating this fact again and again and again these flaws in the author s writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms steel s books it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy repetitive reading,negative
refers to cd recording after picking up and putting down the book countless times i finally listened to this on cd the time and attention i didn t have for the print version came easily for the audio recording guiness is an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his subject matter he draws on foundational christian truths historic and contemporary references anecdotes and a solid business acumen he routinely distinguishes between what something is and is not \( eg vocation calling surrender \) in unequivocal terms also he consistently makes the point that the main reason for our existence is to glorify god everything else in his presentation simply ties back to this truth he explains how we get distracted how others have and how we can correct our path again providing examples and unlike the christianity lite trend in america that often promotes wealth without work or responsibility guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent in a christian life using for example the lives of leonidas st francis and bonhoeffer he also speaks of the joys of a truly god centered life i recommend the call to anyone who is listening for their own call it will help you distinguish between a calling and wish fulfillment fantasy acquaint you with others who have heard their call and inspire you to act if you ve already heard and responded to your call you ll recognize guinness as a fellow traveler this 3 hour presentation was taped live at highland park presbyterian church in dallas tx usa the recording includes 3 audience q a sessions of about 10 minutes each these were as informative as the main presentation often reflecting the very questions i had while listening recording was produced by wpublishinggroup com in nashville tn usa,positive
i had heard of the importance and significance of the education of henry adams for a long time i finally determined i needed to read it i acutally read it twice and found less in it the second time than the first i am sorry i missed the greatness of this book i am sure there was something wrong with me but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there granted he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second rate occupants of the white house but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue blooded snob like adams depresses me why did anyone bother he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery sharp tongues clever remarks and brilliant conversation the world went on without him truth be told and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day he was a very good historian in his time but who reads his books now not very many in short his own work was not as long lasting as he would have wanted it to be maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams the education of henry adams does not have much real information he got education in one place none in others surely the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry but he wrote nothing about it in his book when eric sevareid wrote not so wild a dream it was compared to the education of henry adams that was meant as a compliment oddly i think sevareid s book is much much better sevareid wrote of america the common man the war and what it all meant to him adams needed to get out more he did not see america not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together and defended it i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams again a lot of this might be me perhaps i read the book at a bad time maybe i needed to read it a third time i do not know i do know i do not think this is a great american classic forgive please my ignorance,negative
the other boleyn girl and the queen s fool are two of the best books i ve ever read and i ve read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin s lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it s channeled from another source and times when it s harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i m going back to trollope,negative
i like this author s work so much that i actually bought the hard cover since i couldn t wait for the pb to be issued however p d james view of life as expressed by her characters can be very pessimistic at times \( a contrast to her autobiography \) in this one there is still the feeling that the characters are going through the motions of living never really feeling any joy or often even happiness however when adam and emma come together at the end there was a ray of hope please ms james give us a new book asap,positive
i m perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read grapes of wrath or east of eden instead i have focused on of mice and men and his lesser known works such as to a god unknown and my personal favorite pastures of heaven i ve been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular when i began reading in dubious battle it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck s work telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac s radical cell there is a great \( and misleading \) sense of intrigue mac and jim travel by boxcar work secretly through letters go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers early on the pace is fast exciting and engaging suddenly steinbeck simply fails to deliver leaving the reader wondering when he s going to pick up the pace again after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker s strike i expected the sense of excitement to continue it simply never does summary of in dubious battle workers get mad workers get tired workers get mad workers get tired workers get mad workers get tired the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking and talking and talking and talking and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense and eating steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story because at least a good 25 of the story concerns finding eating and \( worst of all \) talking about food there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment discussing whatever comes to mind steinbeck s sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters but i advise any reader of in dubious battle to take this course after the strike is initiated simply set the book down you won t miss anything nothing of great import happens and only a very few memorable characters ever surface and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces i suppose now i ll give grapes of wrath a go perhaps if it isn t one of his greats it isn t worth reading,negative

this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb however its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo intellectualizations it should be noted that this book was not written by hale it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale s classic drawing lessons from the great masters instead this book loses itself in unimportant erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle confuse frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory,negative
how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding,negative
i was extremely disappointed with after midnight the author his widow has written the book from her own life s perspective and there is sadly little about the true brad davis his homosexuality or perhaps bisexuality is mentioned only in passing and anyone in new york or hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life i guess a book written by his wife can t be expected to delve too deeply into this area but even other interesting details his drug addiction his acting technique etc are only minimally suggested here i wanted to put the book down after two chapters but kept waiting for it to get interesting i suggest the publishers retitle the book my life with brad davis the saga of a wife kept in the dark or something similar to indicate to readers that this book is about susan bluestein and tells very little about brad,negative
after reading the trilogy i was left wondering what the hell happened i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story one of the most creative stories i ve come across in 20 years of reading fantasy there isn t even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess if you look up anticlimax in the dictionary you ll see a picture of this book from first page to last time is wasted on boring characters while all the good ones are either killed off or just mia for the entire book spoilers ahead what about lyra and her parents somehow she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops over a cup of tea naturally and that s it for him in addition to all that this book doesn t even seem to be connected to the first two none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 all in the last 30 pages what happened to the story for cripes sake and what happened to the temptation was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it the whole premise is just so lame to start out with as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn t endanger the universe why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another supposedly they had more than gonads going for them they survived death together pullman didn t feel like thinking it through he just wanted a gut wrenching ending in addition to that he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the reality of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning all of will and lyra s efforts are futile kind of like guess what religion for the rest of us morons after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa elephant aliens or whatever ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper iorek byrnison lee scoresby instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter this is not children s literature it s a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess it s totally dishonest to sell this as a children s book or even as a competent work of fiction all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one we never get closure on lyra s parents we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from we never see will reunited with his mother we get a lame battle where god dies and no one even knows why or how lyra and will fall in love but have to sacrifice it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever with only flimsy reasoning behind it the mulefa and mary malone s work together amounts to nothing everyone just goes home presumably will goes home although we never see it all that yearning after his mother and so forth nothing the major enemies are killed off too easily and what about armageddon what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and you get the idea it all just sort of disovles mary forgot to be the serpent or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa another reader pointed out phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series instead the story falls flat under the weight of the author s own agendas and mockeries what a waste of time i can t believe this book actually won awards it stopped being thought provoking and started being inane and silly it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream instead relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime absurd this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life,negative

i ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my 7 year old son we re doing a research project on oceans and while we have a few good resources i felt this one with its 3d imagery would more likely capture and hold his attention what i didn t realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine for me 3d had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches though the book was described as stereoscopic i didn t understand what that meant stereography was something new for me even if as a form of photography it is over 150 years old this is not a matter of red and blue separations the 3d results from the human eye s trick of blending 2 photos taken \( simultaneously \) an eye s width apart photographer mark blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d photography and his work is beautifully displayed here everyone i ve shown this book to has been fascinated by it and i fully expect that when we ve finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home,positive
this is the latest in a never ending series of books trying to generalize non business world \( eg sports armed forces girl scouts religion nasa etc \) management techniques to the business world most possibly all are of little value because of major differences 1 \) members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently and face greatly significantly different situations what does eg a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist nurse professor financial analyst etc i have no idea 2 \) key success factors vary from one business to another for merck it may be speed of developing new drugs getting through fda approval and motivating physicians to use them for nucor steel it undoubtedly rests much more on low cost production again what does either have to do with fighter pilots little if anything one is better off reading books from similar situations eg about wal mart \( if you are in retailing \) about allied signal or g e \( if you are managing a conglomerate \) and about new york community school district 4 as managed by sy fliegel if you are in public school,negative

this is an enlightening meticulous story of william boss tweed and as past of the context his three key cronies in the ring peter sweeny richard connolly and oakley hall it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page oh how the mighty have fallen the time of power \( terror \) for tweed s edition of tammany hall was relatively short but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed s demise another eithy five years the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build a disgruntled whistleblower \( the term had no meaning back then \) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times hands but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the ring could be how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people s friend the government can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution the cast of characters sinners \( few \) saints and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task thomas nast a pivotal character if not the hero of the book provides some vivid visual signposts nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate readers he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today s politicians nast s giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail a few maps perhaps some old drawings and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed s nefarious deeds and nast s colorful cartoons ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing filling in the gaps and bringing now faded black and white characters back to life,positive

generally my eyes glaze over as i reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious make your own luck by shapiro and stevenson has broken the pattern written in punchy conversational style the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision making the process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure this sounds as if it could be tedious but it s not the authors know you are not sitting in a policy course they know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet the book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus in managing investments i m betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors the tools in make your own luck such as the prediction map are completely applicable to the inferential analysis i use in managing investments as well as life s major problems such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party this book is a good read shapiro and stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the metropolitan museum of art make your own luck makes you laugh makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot,positive
i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details but also historical background because it s an autobiography i don t necessarily think that it s fair to damn the book for being self centered it is about him i do feel however that the book needs better editing and a bit more self examination it s an okay addition to one s list of books about everest expeditions which i must admit i ve developed a morbid fascination with after recently re reading into thin air i wouldn t however use it as my primary source for information or impressions,negative

this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president each individual section includes a brief summary of the president s successes and failures while in office the secrets lives aspect includes a description of his temperament character and personal habits for example john adams is said to have been vain and irritable while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic also much oddball trivia is mentioned such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood the biographical information is at least somewhat educational especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here the truth is that o brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few books such as the reader s companion to the american presidency and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining also o brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars however what i found most disturbing about this book is o brien s tone and attitude his so called humorous style is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents especially those he dislikes for example he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had some unknown frontal lobe damage i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president in fact i disagree with much of jackson s presidential agenda especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians however i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o brien uses overall i found the book to be juvenile mean spirited and overly negative there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there so don t waste your time on this one,negative

overall i found this book disappointing in its defense its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the right \( more closed and intensely religious \) is interesting and i am sure accurate and heilman s analysis of its evolution is insightful and well researched however i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture hareidi society has its own worldview which although too complex to elaborate on here has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores \( for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try real jews by noah efron \) in general i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct \( i e a defensive reaction to the holocaust \) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well or two posters \( put out by the same company \) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music in conclusion although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information,negative

i was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and or loss weight was incidental in this fiercely intelligent novel dorothy and justine are both desperately lonely women both victims of abuse and yet are different in other ways their parents often failed them their childhood was often full of shame and self sabotage but gaitskill writes this with complexity always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer gaitskill is never sentimental underneath her narrative underneath the pain and the sex scenes \( which are never fully loving \) and the disappointments and loneliness is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect on race on class but mostly on gender i sensed that anna granite the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative and who is the reason dorothy and justine first meet is gaitskill s platform for displaying her keen intellect and sometimes there is a hint of didactism but this is a minor quibble the last section moved me very much and proved that although gaitskill abhors sentimentality she can certainly do sentiment well humanity is a word often found in this book our sexuality is connected to our humanity our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human in the end gaitskill s brilliant wonderfully feminist novel was for me about how easily we strip each other of our humanity,positive

i was wrong ok i ve admitted it i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren t my cup of tea while reading conspiracy in death i realized i couldn t have been more wrong i love this futuristic series a homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to eve dallas since it s not a random act of violence this man snooks died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon when dallas digs a bit further she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in new york city where an aged lc \( licensed companion \) died as the result of her liver being removed after even more digging dallas discovers a case in chicago and one abroad that were all similar these were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying in order for eve dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen the closer she got to that answer the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became when she got too close to the truth the villain had to put a stop to her investigation the best way to get dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department this was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered snook s body and dallas when that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on dallas stripped of her badge and weapon the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied the main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise there was excellent character development and as usual j d robb \( aka nora roberts \) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book what makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of eve dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that at times it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot this is definitely one to read as all of the in death series books have been start with the first book when reading because j d robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings or you can start with the first book just because it s the beginning of an excellent adventure,positive
having read this book as well as barnet schacter s on new york during the revolution both works i find are flawed in different ways the likeable thing about gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time the hard thing to realize about the battle of brooklyn is that it really wasn t much of a battle the author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle if that is so then the complete defeat of washy s army bodes ill for that development gallagher is on better ground when he provides a nice overall of tactics and warfare in the 18th century he gives a good account of training and recruitment in both armies one of the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the two rank line used by both sides in the revolutionary war casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light this is an interesting point and one not brought out by many historians of the period in europe stronger lines of 3 and sometimes 4 ranks were employed which provided greater strength but also more density hence increased loss from fire a point well worth considering when looking at the battles of the revolution most historians miss this completely or are not interested in it gallagher provides more of a military history in general on this subject but he does waste a lot of time with preleminaries more than half of the book is spent providing the standard background for the causes of the revolution etc while certainly required for the general reader when a book is as short as this one is it seems almost pointless when we get down to the battle itself gallagher gives us not much more than schacter does the british flank march completely compromises washy s position the outlying forces are swept away clear and simple the confusion of command between putnam and sullivan no doubt made a bad situation worse washy s complete lack of strategic perspective shows up totally here the defense of brooklyn much less manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion washy was mad to consider defending brooklyn much less manhatten in the first place he committed his ill trained army to an impossible task that he did not lose completely was due more to how the british under howe chose to wage their campaign most american authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially a dark canvas at brooklyn the americans ran period a few units stood their ground in particular the marylanders but no one else really did the reason why american losses were not greater was because they did run some authors try to say that british losses in killed and wounded were greater than americans at this battle this is true partly because the british had to attack some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the assault british losses were often greater in this regard because americans usually ran once the british bayonet began to strike home still of the 1 000 casualities sustained by the americans here more than most us historians care to admit fell to british musketry and bayonets the british loss was still well below 400 as the great maurice de saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in this period more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he runs as opposed to when he stands to reserve fire until the enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of this period in that respect many dozens of rebels must have been shot down as they ran before british bayonets gallagher provides some understanding why the british did not storm the heights right away this has often been one of the major criticisms of howe s victory why didn t he follow up after marching all night to outflank the americans the british were disorganized and tired they had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm brooklyn heights memory of bunker hill or no of course this does not explain why it was not done the following day if we look more closely at howe s position we can perhaps explain his rationale his commission was both a general and peacemaker he wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold he could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to the crown was to have destroyed washy s army in brooklyn would have been gratuitous excessive such loss of blood would have defeated the purpose in mind in restrospect it is easy to find fault with this strategy and it would prove to be the only chance the british really had to crush the revolution in its infancy the battle of brooklyn needs to be looked at from several perspectives gallagher gives us a good start but i think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the issues here,positive

always lively and perspicacious this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations \( weapons diseases horses etc \) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america australia new zealand and argentina \( the lands crosby labels neo europes \) what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well the question doesn t appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion but the european housefly and feral pigs and a horde of other weeds pests crops diseases and livestock from europe followed suit quite often these organisms even the domesticated ones raced ahead of european explorers themselves rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom why was this so why didn t say australian weeds their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe to answer this odd question professor crosby begins his story with pangaea the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe these seams of pangaea then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid oceanic seams crosby details case after case in each category weeds pests livestock diseases and crops he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear what is the answer he drops clues every now and then and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all here then is the answer all the opportunistic fellow travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations and they in turn furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium together humans horses cattle pigs rats clover peaches measles and yes dandelions comprised a potent self replicating system dimly discerned by its contemporaries that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea,positive

i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president \( \) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup \( so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large \) anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously so i m not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the 8 50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me but you can guess how this ended up i am down another 8 dollars and change \( i paid the 50 cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it \) and i never finished the book since it was ruined but i liked the parts i read okay and if the president likes it i guess it gets four stars only i made it two stars because i only read half maybe i will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then i will come back and give this book it s missing two stars if it ends well lesson learned is life is not always fair but you keep on keepin on like they say,negative

an amazing resource to the odd world of chick collecting mr fowler has crafted an exhausting almost overwhelming guide to all of chick s works and articles about him everything is cross referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter the book \( presented in a distinctive computer printout style possibly due to its origins as a self published work \) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers but even casual chick fans will enjoy the history of the world segment which ties all of jack s wild theories into a cohesive narrative and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia \( there s a list of every instance of the term haw for instance \) each tract and comic is described and info is given on various parodies and rip offs this is a must for all chick fans \( both saved and otherwise \),positive

if you like this book you will probably like bless the child by cathy cash spellman they are very similar this book can be summed up in one word simple simple minded simple characters simple plot \( applied loosely \) and simple premise what a contrived piece of garbage i can t describe everything wrong with this book because there s not enough time if it s meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through if it s meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims in denial weak worried about what everyone thinks or oblivious if it s meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author s plea for that is irritating that s how bad this book is it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying this author has no style the book reads like an episode of inside edition there is no immersion into the story the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them as a reader i felt completely outside the story an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable i ve been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me do not waste your time i must say though that this novel was inspirational if this crap can make the best seller list it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published,negative

this book is a disappointment it provides little insight into the life or personality of robert redford the actor or the person the book is basically a chronicle of the movies rr has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor but even as a filmography the book fails the reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on tv or in the press in addition the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down robert redford with snide remarks there must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar for sure it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as robert redford however it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject and if they can t do so then there is no book,negative

i truly wanted to like this book after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i d feared but downright enjoyable in addition i d heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last alas it was all down hill from there overall this is one of the worst books i ve ever forced myself to finish this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack author of two other published novels and a short story collection director of a university level creative writing program long term teacher of writing and holder of a ph d in same all to considerable critical acclaim she should be correcting and grading \( failing \) garbage like this not producing it so what went wrong how did this novel end up so awful the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things length if brevity is the soul of wit this novel s witlessness is easily explained at 666 pages \( interesting number that \) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been it would seem that to some extent like melville before her naslund confused length with importance but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self parody somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing with a meat axe or a chainsaw the name dropping one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures but if badly handled these encounters can un suspend disbelief and downright offend they are badly handled here an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid nineteenth century new england and those she doesn t utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund s peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne one or two of these developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude as it is it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor \( or the self awareness \) the politics even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing however naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day \( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day \) from slavery to whaling from feminism to free love from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled all without consequence or even criticism this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today which is to say none the anti christian bigotry there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish the bigoted the future apostate or the mentally ill it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi religious idea of the time except christianity the farfetched scenarios i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi lesbian encounter after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her \( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand \) una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal minded aunt and uncle encounters two young men who both fall in love with her disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them successfully avoids detection is sunk by a whale survives by committing cannibalism marries the surviving young man after he goes insane and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians leaving her free to marry captain ahab \( una never really marries anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes \) things don t get more realistic in the second half which includes una s clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale riiiight the mary sue however the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a mary sue that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader a more realistic main character might have saved it una never learns anything from her life s too many to be believed experiences because she already knows everything she doesn t change because she is already perfect she doesn t have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn t receive any and she doesn t have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides una had her reasons \( and they were very good ones you can be sure \) the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it i feel like i ve just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom with the door locked,negative
if you like physics this is just an interesting book it mostly discusses at length two ideas emergence and reductionism doesn t sound like much and it isn t but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world unfortunately from this point of view to the horizon is not that far mr mclaughlin almost calls the present theories \( like string theory \) science fiction easy on science \( because of the scales and energies involved he seems to think they are not provable i don t have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not \) but he doesn t offer much of an alternative he even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible or not practical well even if he is right which i hope he isn t between can t and science fiction i prefer science fiction tomorrow i ll read a bit of string theory and shake off the depressive mood left by this book,negative

i was intrigued by his the end of history i thought his trust was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books in the end the great disruption is a down right silly book it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama s humanistic ideology clouds it all all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly anna conclusion that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good fukuyama proves that the moral consensus the social capital of the earlier era has been wiped away that crime has sky rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital he doesn t bother to deal with societies like ethiopia that have never been able to build up enough social capital he doesn t really look any further back in history past about 1950 his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history he thinks \( based on his ideology of human goodness \) that things just have to get better if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history he would know better people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long term historical cycles for that i would recommend robert w fogel s the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism fogel a nobel prize winner has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up,negative

more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn t make that connection having read a few of faulkner s works sturgeon uses many of faulkner s narrative trademarks \( i e streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative \) but i didn t feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others so the idea might of been original in the 50 s but topics like telekenesis esp computer brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before \( asimov \) and since this book rarely set off that wow button in my head or kept me turning pages this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book \( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 \) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting \( in this example \) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can t really be ignored besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood s end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci fi needless to say more than human did not win \( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so \) bottom line i wanted to like this book and it doesn t surprise me that others give it such high praise these are probably people that don t read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests,negative
i enjoyed this book immensely remember the subtitle is my friendship with jfk jr the book is about the author and his friendship with john it s not meant to be a historical view of jfk and his presidency why is it ok for carole radiwill to write a book about her relationship with jfk jr and carolyn but not ok for billy noonan because he wasn t on oprah lighten up,positive

i affirm the positive comments of the other reviewers i am a truck driver and dairy farmer and just finished the books on tape version of this book i want to run away to graduate school and get at phd in physics i hated science in school i especialy recommend this book because it affirms true learning it really doesn t start until you fall in love with a subject and go after it just for the fun of it and for the most part on your own much of the book is about his love of physics and scientific exploration he touches upon how to do education wrong with his stories about science education in brazil and his work selecting k 12 science texts for the la school system my independent road of becoming a dairy farmer affirms his thinking and i am so glad i did not try to get an ag degree,positive
this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u s administrations in that sense it is the story of two cities miami and washington and two peoples americans and cubans i have an objection though with the stone hard style in which this volume is so meticulously even gorgeously at times written didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and worse the result is a cold humorless colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup the author in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end readers it is in that sense a boring little disaster of a book,negative

i came across this book while on vacation in a cabin in minnesota i read the entire thing in two days and loved it so much i considered taking it with me this was back before the internet and it took me nine years to find a copy of it that i could buy it was worth the wait these are some of the best short stories i ve ever read they are very well written original and gripping tales that are fun to read and reread if only there were more writers like mr ellin,positive
i must agree with some other reviewers of this book and say that it is a very dry list of factual data interspersed with bill wyman s moans and boasts his gripe with allan klein about money seems to be quite valid but he mentions it about a thousand times mick and keith get quite a pasting again it seems quite valid but do we need to hear it so many times bill opines that keith richard s voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band listen to his only self penned stones track of the 60s on satanic majesties and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion his voice is far weaker and his songwriting at that time was also inferior the book seems to be more authoritative on dates but we can only take bill s accuracy on faith my knowledge of the stones is not enormous but even i can see some big factual errors for example he tells us that neither taj mahal nor marianne faithfull recorded songs for the rock n roll circus a recent re issue has proved him completely wrong as another reviewer rightly said marianne faithfull s autobiog is a much better read,negative

this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth as some readers have complained this is not really a christian book because the focus isn t on christ it s on you a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally the way jesus would and not on trying to find the perfect spouse the whole premise of the book is rather un christlike making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you it s rather selfish really when you consider the words of john the baptist christ must become more i must become less as well as the warning in song of solomon do not awaken love until it so desires shouldn t our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines hearts can be broken and therefore authentic christlike love must take precedence i don t mean to sound accusing but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls seduction my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a poser this happens when forcing yourself to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex you have to ask what kind of people are you trying to attract people who are enticed by your masculinity femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality it is a combination of both action and faith that is important faith to set the situations up action to knock em down,negative
i agree with a number of previous reviewers grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between wicca and witchcraft wicca is not an old religion indeed it is not much of a religion at all it has always lacked definite theology \( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you ll get four answers \) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non scholarly lights in fact the book is poor on all accounts from confused terminology to chopping of source materials this is a waste of money,negative
this truly excellent collection of singer s stories \( all originally composed in the yiddish language \) are as colorful as the people about whom the stories were written here are tales of weddings of jokesters of happy occasions of all variety of feuding farmwives and of unrepentant fools after reading through a handful of singer s works a person gets the feeling of how it must have been to live as a jew in eastern europe a hundred years ago this was a culture rich in its traditions and lore a people who loved life and kept their identity through good times and bad singer himself born and raised in the region so many of his short stories describe was one of very few authors i would unhesitantly dub a human treasure,positive

i ve skimmed a number of popular books published in the last few years on the problem of sexless marriage and this is by far most interesting contribution to date first there is no recommendations for drug therapy anywhere in the book second the author frequently brings into the discussion a european influenced view of some particularly american style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex parenthood gender politics and relationship expectations her fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness and in the course of building and sustaining security we can frequently lose the me and you in us but even more important she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward an egalitarian union while great for chores and child care can be a neutralizer in the bedroom you may or may not find strands of your own dilemma in her case histories but you will not walk away from them empty handed either there are many aspects of the book which are highly nuanced and won t survive well in the o reilly world of broadcast media interviews i can just hear some producer fed talking head asking something like you advocate couples go to vegas for swinging why \( she doesn t \) so don t pay attention to that noise this is an intellegent respectful contemplative work of original thinking that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives and pabulum buy one for yourself and one for your best friend more than likely they re suffering too,positive

never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr west in this book \( in his translator s note \) and by the use of unponderingly and the thinkery \( among other things \) in his translation of the clouds i also read his translation of plato s apology of socrates and found it grossly inferior to jowett four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly it should be hurled with great force \( apologies to dorothy parker \) not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept almost everything that he writes in his translator s note is wrong the clouds is a play not a scientific or mathematical treatise as such it has characters and dialogue a modern translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a modern audience if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary one does not make him spout drivel such as unponderingly one gives him a shtick which is a theatrical term it s more or less a running gag associated with a particular character you create through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together a characterization he could be made to speak like a parody of william f buckley or the star wars character yoda as it stands west s text cannot be presented as a play it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as unponderingly indeed it is inexcusable it conveys neither humor nor cleverness it comes off simply as stupid the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters which dr west obviously does not to state it bluntly the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization and who are creative dr west doesn t have a creative bone in his body in regard to his translation of plato s the apology of socrates the translation by dr west is both original and good but the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good after all when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow the temptation to do something entirely different is strong but it must be resisted if dr west had merely lightly revised jowett s great work he would have made a contribution to learning alas he did neither the version by jowett is clearly superior here is a short excerpt and i must beg of you to grant me a favor if i defend myself in my accustomed manner and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora at the tables of the money changers or anywhere else i would ask you not to be surprised and not to interrupt me on this account for i am more than seventy years of age and appearing now for the first time in a court of law i am quite a stranger to the language of the place and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion of his country am i making an unfair request of you never mind the manner which may or may not be good but think only of the truth of my words and give heed to that let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly compare west s inept version i do very much beg and beseech this of you if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money tables where many of you have heard me and elsewhere do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this for this is how it is now is the first time i have come before a law court at the age of seventy hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here so just as if i really did happen to be a foreigner you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised so also i do beg of you now \( and it is just at least as it seems to me \) leave aside the manner of my speech for perhaps it may be worse but perhaps better and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this whether the things i say are just or not for this is the virtue of a judge while that of an orator is to speak the truth speaking with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak how utterly inept and repetitive didn t he even proof read one doesn t speak with speeches one speaks with words it is obvious that dr west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness which is surprising because this work is supposed to be a speech dr west s version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud whereas jowett s is in west s translation socrates is a clumsy repetitive and inept speaker needlessly so if you want to read a good translation see jowett s 3rd edition \( 1892 \) why does dr west believe himself qualified to make translations nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so this is not the work of a scholar but that of a bungling hack these translations are travesties how does work this nauseatingly bad get published not recommende,negative

this book captures the human spirit at both its best and its worst schwarz bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of ernie levy from birth and on he also shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the nazi movement it is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the jewish people it is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a just man although without them humanity would crumble as future readers will find out their importance and if there really are just men in our world we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders,positive
after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry what kind of people you ll be dealing with what the hiring pricess is like \( with particular emphasis on the interviews \) and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired i m very glad that i took the time to read this book because after finishing it i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable obviously this is simply my own opinion and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work but nearly every single thing about it from the superficial way applicants are screened to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job sounds simply awful to me if you are considering a career as a drug rep you should definitely do your homework to make sure it s really something you would enjoy this book may very well convince you that you would love it if so that s great and i hope you are successful but if this kind of work is not right for you this book can be equally helpful because you ll find out by reading it what the job is really like there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now and although this one was helpful i have to say that i think insider s guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one if you only buy one book definitely buy that one instead but if you buy two books pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice one more thing there s some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants from their shoes to their body language he also stresses well written resumes and cover letters one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it imagine my surprise then when on the very next page it says candidates should right a short paragraph about their job experiences it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book,positive
billy collins s original voice is delightfully accessible often blending comedy and solemnity in one poem and always with something new to say the playful tone of these poems can be misleading whether he is writing about eating a good plate of osso bucco or his favorite museum rooms there is always a pathos lingering in the silence after the last line most relieving is the absence of pretentiousness or haughty language this is simply as robert bly writes in his introduction to the best american poems of 1999 collins s skillful ability to bring the soul up close to the thing in every poem books such as the art of drowning threaten to change the face and purpose of poetry in the 21st century let s hope there is plenty more to come from billy collins,positive

did we need a gore vidal reader the author is something of a long winded blowhard commenting at length \( and i mean length \) on every topic imaginable in that respect he is america s voltaire creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics the arts and religion and morals it s hard to say where vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism as he is not a conventional leftist because of his iconoclasm this collection can only inform the reader about gore vidal not his times nor any intellectual or political movement all that said vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit this book is much too much for the casual reader stick to one of his many shorter collections instead but for a vidal fan \( or say a reader of the nation \) this book is worth the time commitment,positive
along with from science to god mr russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work it has the same hopeful message and the same readability in both books mr russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo even when discussing very complicated subjects that isn t a statement on his intelligence or research but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings in short everyone can sit around his table \( well almost everyone \) read em twice,positive

alien invasion stories have been done to death since h g wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time honored genre well william c dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is first of all the invading force being made up of different races this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles in fighting and fight for freedom \( some are slaves to others \) make for something new different and engaging also using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true and tragic note the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves close off their borders and horde resources the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth and sadly collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans but the seeds of rebellion have been planted humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting,positive

i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers i wasn t as happy with some of her latest efforts but still hadn t given up on her now i m not so sure this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring perhaps it was barr s attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages each scene was more disturbing the one before it i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends but i have absolutely no desire to re read the end of the book and find out i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones but after reading this disturbing somewhat convoluted story i would think twice if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel i d make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn i would certainly not stick with it to the end,negative

unfortunately for all the name brand that this book conveys i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales boggles this readers mind the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book i would be astounded save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation by the way those giving 5 stars either can t read english very well or are shills for mckinsey,negative
jonathan glover s book is not quite like anything you ve read on war state terror and genocide the tour of twentieth century horrors is thematic rather than chronological organized according to the ethical issues glover wants to explore this takes a little getting used to but it allows the author to jump for example from the first world war to the cuban missile crisis to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future the cumulative power of glover s pointillist technique is enormous humanity combines a clear eyed \( necessarily often gruesome \) depiction of in humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better as an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide it marks an advance on ervin staub s classic roots of evil and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics,positive
temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist the author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts conditions locations in the book and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about gabby including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life book was not for me i dropped it at the 3rd chapter,negative

i recently read robert monroe s first book journeys out of body and found it to be a disappointment it was just weird as i noted in my review of that book i had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound for which he is allegedly noted as i purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read i thought i d give it a try the book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his research and i thought that perhaps this book might actually have some real substance that belief however quickly disappeared by the time i had reached the half way point in the book nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish how does total garbage like this manage to get printed there are those that claim that monroe was a highly left brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right brain if this book is any indication one can t help but wonder if monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere there is nothing logical or for that matter even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book it would have been worthwhile if monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner instead he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own personal dream experiences these wander so aimlessly from paragraph to paragraph that one can t help but wonder what real point if any he was trying to make the really sad thing is that i had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work i was actually quite interested in the topic having now been subjected to two of his useless books i m amazed that they re still in print this is pseudo science at its absolute worst,negative
this book provides a fine introduction to the myths of northern europe the book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose written by christian writers after the fact the eddas beowulf and the viking sagas from these sources especially the edda the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the norse gods and their subsequent twilight in ragnarok then the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the northern european peoples the figures of odin thor loki balder and the rest of the norse gods play an important part in our european cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of ragnarok \( the twilight of the gods \) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the christian worldview whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand northern europe in pre christian times finally it must be noted that in many ways at least in my opinion the society of the vikings was superior to our own i admire the strong sense of individualism that the vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats,positive

this book doesn t even deserve a star i just fell upon it on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house i m nearly 17 years old and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older but honestly i don t see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years i ve read so many reviews raving about how poetic sensual wonderful it is and what a talent the person is sorry i don t see it anyone can write a bunch of sex stories i didn t see anything poetic in the writing it was plain as for sensual and arousing hardly it was crude and vulgar it was sex sex sex and presented harshly with none of the sensuality the sweetness the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex it was boring repetitive and i ll admit disturbing what was the point of the story where the hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children or the raped little boy it was just weird there s just the sex and no development of any points she may be trying to make it s kind of just left there unfinished unsatisfying frankly it was so distasteful \( vulgar \) i was shocked and i m not religious puritan conservative or any such thing quite the opposite i have an open mind but this book left me cold,negative

maybe believe your suspenders i m not sure which it seems to me that to enjoy this book you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability you also have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist who s pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet earth seems pretty improbable what you get in return are some amazing language some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish much too cerebral to ever be made into a movie by any director alive now this is a book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked out but craftsman like writing,positive
after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes noble that same night dr whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers however if at home you are on dr whitley s 10 step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation the constant image of mr rogers in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents of course that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he she is capable of frightening resistance obviously professional help with someone in tuned with dr whitley s methods would be more advisable than his book to me this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less and possibly 7 8th graders these kids still have some moldability and aren t as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem \( i e depression \) for the grammatically correct the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author 0 \),positive
many words few practical tips this book did not give much more \( valuable \) information than i already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer after reading the book i still had to search for web communities where some of my questions could be answered my expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks contacts and appointments unfortunately in my view these important and basic issues were treated too superficially,negative
while talk to the hand is inescapably mediocre in comparison to eats shoots leaves a book i found amusing though not up to par to its new york times bestseller status this book does have its moments however i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that despite whatever way she meant it ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice i find it interesting that she or at least her editors did not further investigate the disease \( which indeed gluten tolerance is \) before publishing such a degrading remark oh yes bloody well sorry ms truss for invading your rude stay home and bolt the door causitive world with yet another irritation which i m sure someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet let s just go and well obliterate a genetic disorder while we re at it we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk if it pleases and thanks you ms truss we celiacs will eat cake \( oh bloody hell did i just say please \) despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place i have to wonder if she s experiencing the effects of projection in explaining how rude we humans are it was necessary for her to be quite rude as well it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer i also found her supermarket incident in which a kid shouts at his mother i want that one you effing bitch among others a bit offensive as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness i was often thoroughly appalled by this book no my friends and i don t usually hold doors for each other but in general i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown frankly i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends as well as strangers than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation or if they must answer they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them i have to argue that we are not a select group in today s world one sees what one expects to see one is treated as one expects to be treated ms truss i believe would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could she would be surprised to find that when people are rude she cares less because she knows that she at least is doing her best not to be if she did this maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior my last complaint is this gluten crap you would think that such a sophisticated eloquent \( as she is dedicated to proving \) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third year am i not so cool and bitchin \( \) style word crap,negative

maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow it is the first mystery novel that i have read by a female author and i hope that it is not representative of the gender but by the reviews here all by women i can see that jance writes to that crowd her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible if you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you it is amazing that jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue the insulin bottle jance gives no indication that oak vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time if you want a good mystery read coben crais patterson or michael connely,negative

dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it dragonart how to draw fantastic dragons and fantasy creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper dragonart is divided into three major parts fantastic dragons unique details and other fantasy creatures along with an introduction a section on how to use the book and a brief guide to fantastic creatures lessons in this book are progressive in nature beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design all illustrated with step by step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout and author artist jessica neondragon peffer has a clear easy writing style that can be easily comprehended absorbed and acted upon an example of which follows below okay so we re going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct but that will happen if your creature doesn t look believable to help make your dragon as real as possible base its structure on real creatures she writes at one point \( page 44 \) the ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat bird and reptile body types the trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out you want it to feel like a single creature this advice incidentally is very reminiscent of that given by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk making peffer well read or naturally very insightful either of which speaks well for her under how you should make an imaginary animal look natural the increasingly famous renaissance man writes you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs each of which in itself must resemble those of some other animal hence if you wish to make an animal imagined by you appear natural let us say a dragon take for its head that of a mastiff or hound with the eyes of a cat the ears of a porcupine the nose of a greyhound the brow of a lion the temples of an old cock the neck of a water tortoise dragonart also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures including basilisks chimeras gargoyles and griffins for those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book a companion dragonart kit how to draw paint fantastic creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon author peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art website neondragonart com which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves,positive
sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author when the author is in error about that subject the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book such is the case here i ve written 123 books several on parachutes and skydiving i am a pilot skydiver and parachute rigger i know the sport and the industry the author wrote we use flat chutes as parasails what is flat square rectangular ram air a parasail is a kite and is usually under tow behind a boat this sentence does not make any sense four miles up he pulled that would be 21 120 feet the use of oxygen is not mentioned ferocious out of control spiral one of the cells collapsed the collapse of a single cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily re inflated corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse not likely guide lines an uncommon reference they are referred to as control lines or toggles he jettisoned the main canopy at 15 000 feet he freefell ten seconds and opened his reserve at 12 700 feet the rest of the team on this haho jump would still be at 18 000 feet five minutes later he would be at about 8 000 feet he estimated he had about 15 minutes of glide remaining more like eight minutes he was so relaxed he was startled to hear canopies fluttering all around him and the sound of men splashing down just under him how did they all beat him to the landing area they were 5 000 feet above him fiction writers have a responsibility to make their descriptions accurate when a reader finds obvious discrepancies in one area it makes him or her wonder if the rest of the book is accurate and the writing is not creative dan poynter the parachute manual the skydiver s handbook danpoynter parapublishing com,negative

this is a decent book on photographing artwork but not the the most comprehensive the strengths of this book are that mr saddington \( 1 \) discusses the use digital media and \( 2 \) makes the process of photographing artwork very user friendly by providing great visual references throughout the user friendly aspect is the book s strongest selling point especially for artists who are new or novices at photography or visually oriented \( i e no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures \) mr saddington s book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure photograph and provides a concise explanation for these results and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure photograph he also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing the weakness of this book lies in the general details provided unfortunately mr saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting i base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called photographing your artwork by russell hart if you buy mr saddington s book i d recommend supplementing it with the purchase of mr hart s book the two books complement each other where mr saddington s book lacks in details mr hart s book fills in the information gaps on the other hand mr hart s book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations so if you re a visually oriented person mr saddington s book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process again mr saddington s book is decent but it should be used as a supplemental reference especially for the visually oriented person,negative
not even worth finishing this book this author does not know enough to even write this book i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be it is a one sided story not based on facts which it what most writers do but purely fiction the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on not the postive stories that i hear about everyday don t waste your money,negative

this is my first ludlum book and it is sure to be my last the plot is preposterous because of ludlum s limited understanding of economics and history once you realize that all interest in the story falls away it starts off plausible enough and the blurbs on the jacket imply some weapon more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania some spoiled rich american brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history i know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction and it is all in good fun but the plot concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest if you don t need logic in your fiction it s interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story but it falls far short in the historical \( and economic \) fiction department,negative
after anticipating the arrival of this book \( that i ordered some time before publication after hearing of it \) i was disappointed although the subject is timely the writing style smacks of academia and therefore will not appeal to the mainstream \( reader \) because i m tenacious by nature i finished the book but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention too bad it could have been inspirational,negative

let me get myself straigh here first i have always been a fan of the artemis fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins i loved the first one and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies instead of saving them from some kind of evil foe also the fairies were pretty cool and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism they were high tech and armed with laser guns unfortunately the author put artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz now let me rewiew this particular book its a horrible read who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts no me now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd i mean seriously a barbie doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they re boys how old is the author anyways two years old well obviously he s not married thats for sure i always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds not four year olds anyways enough of that the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father i read colfer because he writes futuristic books that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn t even solve robberies instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war all of the wicked humor is lost there is no action whatsoever the main charecter isn t a genius with wicked humor and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others heavily downgraded adn obviously the worst parts do not even read this thing get some other artemis fowl books or read alex rider thats a very good read,negative
these are true tales from a clinical neurologist s notebook but this isn t just any neurologist oliver sacks author of the justly celebrated the man who mistook his wife for a hat \( 1986 \) and awakenings \( 1973 \) which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams and other works is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating yet studiously objective a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations historical comparisons and wisdom part of the power of these tales and of all of sacks s work is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality this makes for a compelling read if you ve never read sacks before you are in for a very special treat these tales are paradoxical because defects disorders diseases can bring out latent powers developments evolutions forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence it is this creative potential that forms the central theme of this book \( from sacks s preface page xvi \) the first tale the case of the colorblind painter is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty five and the effect this had on his life and work the second the last hippie is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties sacks tells this sad pathetic story with vivid detail and characteristically ends it with a footnote a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears \( don t skip the footnotes \) the third tale a surgeon s life is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette s syndrome it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination dr carl bennett riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder compulsions that cause him to throw things to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner to flail jump and jerk about nonetheless became a very successful \( and beloved \) doctor of surgery sacks scrubs up with dr bennett and goes into surgery with him during which miraculously the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be the fourth tale to see and not see is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination in the fifth tale the landscape of his dreams we meet a gifted artist franco magnani who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito italy through his paintings he has a nearly photographic three dimensional memory but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty one he cares only to re create his pontito not the people or events but the houses the masonry the stones and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail the chapter prodigies focuses on an autistic artist stephen wiltshire whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand in this tale and the concluding tale an anthropologist on mars sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it \( at least in my interpretation \) as an alternate view of reality a view with its own strengths and weaknesses a world that is just as true and valid as the normal one of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society yet perhaps that is society s loss i even got the sense in reading these concluding stories about autism that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary strategy trying to emerge that is a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness and that humankind is the better for it incidentally the last tale about temple grandin who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society yet remains autistic she is the one who says she sometimes feels because of her different perspective like an anthropologist on mars when she views normal people sacks allows us to see why bottom line this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition written with grace and a deep sense of humanity not to be missed,positive
although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa i find this book difficult to understand the difficulty seems to come from the authors desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages this leads to a cryptic language where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words a thing which personally frustrated me,negative
the author is an owner and operator of a tutoring center he is not an expert in auto mechanics as he points out on the back cover the pictures and the concepts were for teenage boys and the accompanying graphics are of poor quality if you actually want to learn anything substative of autos this is a poor poor choice you are better of visiting the automotive section of www howstuffworks com or some similar website to learn more with better graphics and for free i bought this book long time ago and finally had the time to look at it and i regret it,negative
i think this is the best book that i have ever read i thought that the civil war was very very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye each character has a different story of the war and of life i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn this book was excellent from the first page i read even though this novel is very brilliant some people might not like it if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz he had the funniest voice i ever heard when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too trust me before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really really new to me i had to get use to it a little but since it wasn t very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story in the story he sounds like he s from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and doesn t talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart,positive

tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author \( tim cohen \) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen s the real rapture \( based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series \( see prophecy house s web site for details on these items \),negative

i too have an ma in american history and i was never given reason to think about each of two questions raised by this important book firstly and fundamentally what was the timetable by which the british military were expected to leave the former colonies and second what property could they take with them especially as property had a very particular meaning here in the new nation was the revolution in large part fought to maintain slavery that surely bears on the problematic nature of our constitution the wonderfully gifted writer and historian \( would that they were always the same thing \) poses these vital questions and we are fortunate that the near simultaneous publication of david b davis inhuman bondage complements this fine effort so as one reviewer suggests it is in some ways an overwritten period but schama and davis add something new and exciting to the dialogue my thanks,positive
as a follower of the celebration story for many years i was greatly disappointed by what i thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town it was nothing of the sort the book had the feel of so many pages of anti disney propaganda and the repetitiveness of a bad serial the authors of celebration u s a clearly made up their minds about celebration long before signing off on a mortgage lacking in the detail needed to illustrate celebration s experiment with the tenets of neotraditional style the book offered splashes of cliched generalities such as a return to the past and recapturing tradition it soon became some sort of mantra exhorting disney s ownership of the town the rules imposed on property improvements and maintenance and interestingly the attention the town received most tactless of all was the shadow of mockery cast on every description of residents conversation with neighbors and interaction with people doing what the authors should have been doing giving the town a chance,negative
i love mr koontz and have long read his novels watchers intensity odd thomas and so on but this was dissappointing not to mention just plain depressing and come on with the corny slap stick banter between the characters okay okay we know the 9 year old leilani has a high iq but really she speaks like a 50 year old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence these characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into therefore i put it down after 350 pages of this twattle koontz has done much better in the past lastly let s keep dogs out of your next few novels please it s getting a bit old how about a smart cat or raven for your next novel maybe mixed with some more down to earth folks that speak like real people do,negative
i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times,negative
i was very disapointed in the book basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others twisted their words and put his own spin on it it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down there are good books out there written by people who were there i suggest you take a look at those i read many good one s but this book wasnt in that catagory,negative

i will not lash out against anyone and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious ostentatious egotism that said let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth s solutions extremely difficult to accept first off it doesn t do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus s morals in general terms if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus s codices the key point here is that jesus s older analects were deluded enough his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale jesus s peuplade appears to be growing in number i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations circumvent any further litigation and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death all by trumping up a phony emergency his desire to control your bank account your employment your personal safety and your mind is the chief sign that he s a slaphappy caitiff \( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo treatment to cure my problem \) perhaps i m reading too much into jesus s ravings but they don t seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests jesus s pr cis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent noxious feudalism that s pretty transparent what s not so transparent is the answer to the following question does jesus s oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities a clue might be that every time he tries jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought but for imagination as well jesus s eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing \( remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil \) jesus of nathareth has an agenda a political social and cultural agenda and that s all i have to say,negative
i bought this audio cd set at the borders store without the opportunity to preview the narration had i been able to do so i probably never would have purchased it let alone paid full bookstore price for it but i needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day so i relented lesson learned the audio quality is very insonsistent at at times very poor having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording while the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the middle east it does read very much like a history text with the amount of detail presented and the wide scope of coverage from one end of europe reaching into the former soviet states and beyond one immediately feels the need for visual aids \( maps timelines etc \) as guidance the reader s narration is monotononous with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses each sentence sounds the same as the last this has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity after a while the narration becomes little more than background noise no information is retained by the listener,negative
immediately upon starting dickens our mutual friend i was struck by parallels with dumas the count of monte cristo both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice the count deals with the darker theme of revenge our mutual friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth the novel is lively throughout as dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents the tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper class politics and antisemitism to delicate romance to witty visual humor the characterizations are highly original even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies most impressive to me was the consistency of dickens plot our mutual friend was written and published in installments as was the count of monte cristo but dickens keeps his story on track throughout never dropping a character while dumas tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies,positive
i m about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing i kept thinking maybe it s me maybe there s something wrong with my attention span that i lose interest in these stories half way thru they all seem too long unfocussed what they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories the quality puzzles me because i m almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf i read in the zines i haven t followed this anthology over the years but this particular edition imho shows bad selection and worse editing,negative
stephen king has written another attention grabber i read and listened as i have both the paperback and the audio book i found this book great as it follows both the imaginary and the real sides of life i found that as i read the book i really would like to visit the library that is described in the book this book follows down a strange path emerging in what could almost be explained as a real story of fact in the past i recommend this novel and the audio book as the narrator does a great job it will not dissapoint as everything s eventual did in my opinion good luck and good reading \( note the audio version of this book is narrated by frank muller anyone who has listened to stephen king audio books has sure to have been wowwed by frank muller in this audio book recording frank muller s voice is almost unrecognizable and amazing as he plays this roll frank muller and audio books are truly like movies for your mind \),positive
a useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing accounting standards and approaches between countries however it is not worth the price it is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students it is more suitable for general second year accounting students plus as i am working with a multinational european bank in japan the book is rapidly becoming out of date there is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries,negative
i just got through reading harvey penick s little red book i enjoyed it so much that i had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller s feedback page but the book was that enjoyable i read the book because i was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals i don t even play golf i was able to apply harvey penick s words to attitudes and approaches to life though he not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one s life his methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me he refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings instead he accentuates the positive he educates by guiding his students instead of teaching them i love his ability to teach with images parables and metaphors his chapter first things first about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great after all the problem is not always what you think i challenge anyone to read harvey penick s little red book and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives whether you play golf or not this book is good reading,positive

as a young woman i was appauled by gurian s lack of respect for women as human beings what makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in life the resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional roles i don t remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness gurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his tricks his book is full of agenda,negative
gaylife on the english countryside is like everywhere you never know when your bf \( boyfriend \) gets bored with you the battle with london s competitive nightlife makes you reguarly ask yourself what have i to offer the efforts to entertain your bf are as tiresome as the question how organize your own life so it won t get dull and once you got things fixed you yourself run into this willing guy the tragicomedy the spell tells the story of four men robin the ageing architect who enjoys his life together with his younger bf justin a witty layabout robin s son danny a georgeous body dealing in superficiality and justin s former lover alex a well mannered young man in search for consistency to find out if they all get what they want is a truly delicious way to spend your time the story is written out of the perspective of all leading parts and therefore very nicely ballanced hollinghurst is gifted with a great sense of attentiveness his characters show many different moods caused by tiny events every self assured attitude is merciless exposed i recognized myself and my friends many times without realizing this ever before it made me smile and reassured me i think this is hollinghurst s most post modern novel unlike the swimming pool library s sexual odyssee this is a splintered glimps into life and how down to earth it can be,positive
need i say more than the above title suggests okay so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience there are some touching moments in this book but even then there is still something the author is lacking i saw the movie when it was in theatres and i have just finished reading the book i liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book the movie was funny entertaining touching personal and sad at times the book did not captivate me at all i had trouble staying focused considering beverly donofrio s credentials a bachelor s degree in english from wesleyan university and a master of fine arts in creative writing her quality of writing is very poor her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education if even that and not to go off topic but since donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like columbia u then why doesn t she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life i mean after all the mfa is in creative writing meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time she has only wrote 2 books riding in cars with boys and looking for mary both about her getting pregnant at a young age if you liked the movie just leave it at that don t bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed and if you re interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy then go to the local library don t get this one there s other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one,negative
thankfully this is not littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies the hallmarks of 99 of the latest and greatest business books especially since it was written in 1999 moore s is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high tech industry he was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005 the book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation i help run an online software development company and although it isn t exactly high tech i still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of it fascinating market shifts are demanding broadband wireless internet everywhere free companies are shifting towards web basing software applications all very relevant to my business the book is well written an easy and moderately fast read and very accessible by anyone who is technology savvy enough to at least hold an email address yes buy it buy the paperback and save money short synopsis in the infancy of a market products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno geeks nothing new here when a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority where the biggest money sits it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so the emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive tailored product that meets all of their needs create the whole product by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together then stop tweaking the product if that works pick related niches and go after them the same way creating the whole product for each of them once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market \( this all deals with new high tech changes \) and start doing so en masse the strategy must completely shift again to a ship first fix the product later mentality in a mad market share scramble at this phase you are in the tornado lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone at each stage mentioned above,positive
oh how i wanted to love devon s book he was such a charming rascal in wicked and such a bore in sinful there was no meat to this story the back of the books summarizes it nicely what would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages i admit i only made through about half before skimming and realizing it wasn t going to get any better there s no sizzling tension the love scenes weak and the mystery is predictable i had such high expectations for this boscastle book since drake s was brilliant and devon s character seemed such a lovable rogue not a keeper for me,negative
i was hoping that miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a classical epic what we get is a blood splattered 300 lacedaimons in the hood the spartans are presented to be a buch of homo erotic rastafarians the persians rather than the noble middle eastern autocrats presented in their art are drawn by miller to resemble african american gangstas with piercings and skin art everywhere i was looking for xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot if you were into sin city you will love this mishmashed version of the classical tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds,negative
as mentioned this book is amazingly compact cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages that conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing the authors mention in the preface that classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof for those with a serious interest in mathematics this is a useful resource for most others the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff included with the book is a one page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information including common rules for derivatives and integrals geometric formulas a few conversion factors trigonometric identities and graphs \( very useful \) and more the book also has a three page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased european males who made calculus possible given all of this i would highly recommend this book as an 800 page calculus reference text or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters then using it saves you money but for those who don t have a super strong background or interest in math those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before or for those who are just plain math phobic using this book just doesn t make any sense i wouldn t recommend it for those who are stuck with this book for a course i d suggest looking for another book to help you out one possible book has already been mentioned in another review silvanus thompson and martin gardner s calculus made easy a book that dates back originally to 1910 \( \) i ve read parts of it and the book looks good to me i m sure that there are many other helpful books try checking your local university library or looking on amazon for ideas an extra calculus textbook that s more student friendly might be a good idea as for the pages falling out i haven t had a problem with it \( i have the 8th edition \) but i don t use the book all that much i haven t found any serious errors in the text but i haven t read everything thoroughly having only used the text for calc iii and yeah getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea,positive
this book reads like a horror novel by allowing her dogs \( as well as another one in her care \) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals welfare not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps oh and let s not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author s choice not to spay and neuter her animals this book moves at a peppy pace and might have been interesting \( albeit morally reprehensible \) if the author s observations actually provided any insight but those eighteen wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author s whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence case in point she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one s litter of puppies oops any genuine dog lover \( or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense \) will despise this book a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head if feelings are your road map to life you might enjoy this book if you regularly take your brain out for walk forget it calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling jonathan livingston seagull the definitive text on marine fowl,negative
children love to follow instructions step by step and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep drag on for hours any adult who cooks like this doesn t cook often cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen for example who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter melts it in a pan then pours it into a \( plastic microwave safe \) mixing bowl great now there s a pan a knife and a cutting board to wash it is a children s cookbook so why not cut down on time spent with knives stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave nice pictures large font recipes are great but \( in my opinion \) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen not a home,negative

a refreshing look on software development and the many pitfalls you need to avoid this book should be read by everybody involved in any software project but the simplest in my opinion a standard work nevertheless it needs to be handled with care during ages sw development managers have tried convincing their people to break out of the chaos and plan their work this book correctly warns for the opposite effects of believing that planning solves everything some people might however read between the lines that no planning at all is the best practice the book confirms what i and my successful colleagues found through experience and intuition there is an optimal point of planning upfront less harms because you don t know where you are going more \( too detailed \) harms because it takes away flexibility and it slows you down significantly new to me was the use of queuing theory to point out what we see every day too many features under resourcing leads to far bigger delays than human mind can ever guess,positive

i love this book it s beautiful this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly causing the ruckus with all the animals the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and therefore may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend the pigs in the muck the kittens in the hayloft the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming s gorgeous art each time my nine month old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter this is definitely one of his favorites i highly recommend this book,positive

this book is a very good study into what happen to the lost ten tribes of israel mr capt did a great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the assyrians which is called the house of omri this book is very in depth and very informative i also noticed a person left one star because mr capt did say anything about the jews of course the jew s wouldn t be metioned they weren t taken into exile until 586 bce and that was by babylonia and not assyria when reading about the ten tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not jews over all i give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid bible reader intrested in research,positive

only knowing jack canfield from the very successful chicken soup for the soul mega series i had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life this lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions a absolute must read book for understanding the real you,positive
after reading a fine balance i couldn t wait to read another book by this author i then read his third book called family matters which was good but i was disappointed as it by no means compared to a fine balance i just finished such a long journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots it is my least favorite of the three books by this author it s hard to believe that someone can right a book like a fine balance which was magnificant and one of the best books i have ever read and then turn our stuff that is at best average,negative
this is the second book in the wind dancer series the wind dancer being the first which was excellent i almost feel as if i liked storm winds even more than the wind dancer and i believe it s due to a more comprehensive abundance of history i was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book from the first chapter until the last one the characters were very individualistic and intriguing i have to say i enjoyed the romance more between the two supporting characters catherine and francois more than the main characters juliette and jean marc i was enamored by francois and his strength steeliness and sensuality jean marc was a dark handsome man as well because of the way juliette was treated in her youth i see why she was so desperate for someone to need her hence her demanding take charge attitude to care for her friend and others catherine was a delight she was soft caring and sweet but her terrible experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature fascinating characters and historical background i would recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn t the typical dull harlequin type and a love for important historical eras,positive
save your time money and patience this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous predictable stone barrington novel the short forever wow this one stinks like others i put up with the shallow characters ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers boobs and guns to figure out whodunit unfortunately this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid who on earth did kill vance and come to think of it who gives a damn i don t what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt every female character save for isabel the maid felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb vacuous self centered and thoroughly unlikeable hey a couple are even truly psychotic the only normal female character who spared stone mary ann unfortunately has a room temperature iq i am hardly a prude but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth mr woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought,negative

this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms story and it s hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale the king threatens to kill the miller s daughter if she can t spin gold from straw rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her but extracts a necklace a ring and on the third night of spinning a promise of her firstborn she then marries the king whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name so the king though he looks good is greedy and brutal the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life and then depends on an anonymous unrecognized servant girl to save the child and rumpelstiltskin shown as physically unattractive and \( the message seems to be \) therefore bad is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for a weird twisted story that offers nothing for kids illustrated with renaissance style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad,negative
april of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved america but april of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so it was during this time that washington dc sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession once virginia did leave the union only maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best abraham lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on general winfield scott for his part scott was keenly aware of the danger facing washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to dc quickly from loyal northern states the problem was that these militia units would have to travel through maryland a slave state that might well consider these yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty it was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of maryland but also ultimately by the state militia in the meantime virginia forces had seized the federal armory at harper s ferry and the gosport navy yard near hampton virginia rumors are rampant in dc that the virginia militia that had taken harper s ferry was preparing to move on washington and many in the federal city were in a state of panic the questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether washington dc was ever in any real danger did the confederacy in fact lose it s only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period david detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner this book reads much like a great historical drama and the author s writing style is superbly readable it is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome detzer has accomplished this however and although i was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn i had a tough time putting the book down this invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of american history no hero of american history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even ben butler is praised when his actions merit it this is the story of those fateful days of april and may of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author this book is well researched very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the pennsylvania militia it is a story upon which the fate of the united states once turned,positive

i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively that is about the only positive aspect of this book the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable sara s family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family sara s twin sister gets all the attention and love leaving sara starving for parental care finally christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone i wasted my time with this book please don t waste yours,negative

susanna rowson s charlotte temple is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman poor pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings charlotte temple was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now charlotte temple has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary in the past twenty years feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati authors such as anne plumptre frances burney aphra behn sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries unfortunately rowson does not warrant such treatment rowson has a flat humorless approach to the fallen woman story unlike burney s evelina or camilla rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity her pedantic iron fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates in many of the fallen women stories authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man in england and america it was not considered altogether lady like to read a novel so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed rowson does not criticize men within the novel she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend s mistress he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting dishonorable against her yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her she would not have been reduced to a penniless pregnant ex mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte s downfall rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it instead rowson places the blame for charlotte s ruin on the women within the novel when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue madame du pont sets charlotte s downfall in action rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville charlotte elopement miss la rue the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville must be punished for being a promiscuous woman she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women why would modern readers want to read this i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel at 125 pages it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace no character has any shadings there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte rowson does nothing to keep our interest unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best selling novel that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia but it does not make for engaging reading,negative

you get your money s worth here there are a ton of cds in this audio book unfortunately i found bryson s prose \( which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently as i have done with his other books \) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud to me he sounds kind of affected in parts and sometimes there is a sort of moist sound when he pronounces words hard to describe until you hear the cd but trust me on this one i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book and not the cd i would stick with the written word on this one,negative

i really like this series of books that range from this storage one to bathrooms family houses etc but i am giving this book a 4 because it shows alot of houses that seem to be beyond the means of most people that i know around my area this book also likes to tell you to build storage in every little crack space that does not currently have something useful going for it i am giving it 4 stars because it does inform you of all of the different types of devices that are currently \( as of the book being published \) available to help you make storage possible in nooks and crannies it also gives you ideas and suggestions about how you can make more use out of the storage that you already have by redesigning the shelving to make it more attractive also try not to read it all at once though because i started to gloss over stuff just to get to the end of the book take it a step at a time and it will be a great start for you,positive

myths are important but they should not be labeled history 1 george washington was not a great guerilla leader he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines just like the redcoats washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops 2 ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear disarming of the soviet union eisenhower and kennedy tried but \( lbj \) nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe but the big nukes that could end civilization were already being cut back this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan but some of the history cited is wrong,negative
it s hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout truly basic and nothing new here spend your money elsewhere,negative

good but it simply wasn t actionous enough i don t mind having no action in a book \( otherwise how else could i love foundation so much \) but children was a book that needed to have action in it unfortunately it didn t really too much philosophical babble that i had to re read to get it slightly reminiscent of card s later shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue too much about jane not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about ender which annoyed me to my shock ender s death did not really impact me in any way beyond huh wait ender is dead so little was his role in the book he probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether edit from now on i am never giving a book that i halfway like two stars again because each time i receive the urge to change my rating to three stars just keep in mind that while it says two it means three,negative
the first novel of laurell k hamilton s merry gentry series is not actually that terrible a book it s by far the best in a not particularly great series actually what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise the set up is one of the most grotesquely ridiculously stupid things i ve ever read princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie in fear of death at the hands of her aunt andais the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court high profile fae in this world are major public figures like rock stars or the royal family of england the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed every news media in the world reports the story and it never goes away we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings meredith s image the story of her mysterious disappearance is everywhere i mean neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is and what she looks like meanwhile princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye thing is she hasn t disguised herself very much at all her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin her fae red hair is now human red hair her facial features remain the same and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith for years on end no one recognizes her let me hasten to add there is no magic involved in this they honestly simply don t recognize her and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she s actually princess meredith is wait for it merry gentry jesus wept and for years none of her co workers no one who knows her says to themself hey wait a minute that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith merry gentry princess meredith oh my god merry gentry is princess meredith nope she s just incognito baby at which point i almost threw down the book and said you have got to be kidding me it s absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process do laurell hamilton s editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing given her past six or eight novels including this one i m tempted to say no actually,negative
i am a huge john grisham fan i believe the first grisham book i ever read was the pelican brief after that i was hooked i admit that through the years mr grisham s work has become less grishamisc and not as entertaining as earlier works but you ll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does i first started this book by listening to it on cd i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it i was right the book starts out with action and pulls you in the action barely lets up through the entire book this is a different kind of action more mental than physical there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works is that there isn t really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve generally we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending however in this book it is more of a life lesson about greed there is no bad guy nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character etc the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life the characters are likeable and easy to follow there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story i found the book very easy to read and follow i always wanted more although the book has a different theme than most grisham books i still really enjoyed it it reminded me why i like to read his books so much it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending if you like this one try the eariler works as well if you have seen the movies it doesn t matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way this book would make a good movie but we ll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point happy reading,positive
this was the first collin wilson book i read he has probably read a lot to write this book but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about if you are interested in this matter \( the occult knowledge \) as something you would read about but never ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything maybe this book is ok but if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake please stay away from this book he is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation,negative
i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti i found the subject interesting and the professor gave wonderful lectures i had good expectations about this book going in but those quickly soured as i read it it seems correct at least about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock not that such is a particularly daunting feet however it is rife with laughable fallacies for instance it calls david bowie amongst other glam rock bands of the era metal it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all such as the carpenters i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs for instance it claims thunder rolls by garth brooks is about domestic violence its about infedility not focusing on violence at all but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on the writing is also rather dry many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band s successes or failures after reading the book in completetion i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues \( 50s to 60s \) that i had thought were true in the end i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything,negative
my husband is icelandic and unfortunately this book was no help at all it s perfectly fine for the traveller but in trying to live everyday life conversing with new family members forget it i would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand if you are quite serious about learning this language i would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive colloquial icelandic for me at least it s quite easier to understand has complete grammatical charts in the back as well as a fairly decent dictionary again if you are only learning for business trips and such then this would be a good option for those of us actually moving there her book is not so good,negative
i am vietnamese and i grew up in new orleans during the 80 s and 90 s when the first waves were settling down there i hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people the vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards uneducated and simple further the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success if you actually grew up in new orleans during the time that the vietnamese americans were setting root during the 80 s and 90 s you would know that by and large the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful no real vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book i repeat no vietnamese american thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book the book repeats many of the fallacies that i have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about east asian culture there always seems to be 1 \) an asian prostitute 2 \) caucasian guy with asian bride 3 \) asian male in an emasculated role 4 \) asian people as backwards and simple quite sad this book reminds me quite a bit of memoirs of a geisha though that portrayed japanese culture in a better light by the way the lady on which memoirs of a geisha is based and written about was quite upset at the author of memoirs of a geisha and did not feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at all regardless if you really want to find out about the vietnamese american experience you should really read a book written by a vietnamese american,negative

dr amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family the stigma associated with mental illness is deep seated and difficult to overcome understanding the root causes particularly the genetic predisposition within families is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life long problems these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse they do not deal with the biological root causes once those are dealt with the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life however without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch take my advice if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar get help as recommended you will become a new person the one you were created to be and that is a wonderful thing,positive
a well researched look at aviation that reminded me of the novels of nevil shute my favorite chapter was friday norton qa 11 50am a perfect description of the working methods of a certain veteran tv newsman who just retired at age 88 of course there are plot holes the heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards but as the jeopardy increases the guards aren t there no followup mention what happened to them some vulgarity in language but all in all a great fun read,positive

i was really looking forward to reading ever after when i saw the favorable quote on the back cover by larry gelbart but the book turned out to be a very cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight here are the three things i learned from this book \( 1 \) mega musicals are almost always artistically corrupt \( 2 \) andrew lloyd webber is the anti christ \( 3 \) the only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started off broadway \( mostly at playwrights horizons and lincoln center \) most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each with very few illuminating details here s what the author says about carrie perhaps the most famous recent broadway musical flop carrie of course was an instant classic a monument in the pantheon of failed broadway musicals adapated by michael gore \( music \) and don pitchford \( lyrics \) from the notorious stephen king novel \( and even more notorious film \) this 7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the virginia theater on the 12th of may 1988 and was gone by the 15th touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible monumental ineptitude does that really tell us very much about this musical did barry singer even see the show you sure wouldn t know it from this description and just what i wonder makes king s novel notorious or the movie even more notorious almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention but somehow singer finds time for an entire chapter of lloyd webber bashing where sir andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery the chapter sticks out like a sore thumb if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book but also because it s one of the few times that singer goes into any detail aside from a few interesting sondheim quotes this book is a waste of time,negative
as a fan of gitlin i was hoping that he d give me the bottom line his bottom line on the air we breathe today the same way that brave souls such as lasch marcuse and bell have done but gitlin isn t brave he admits honestly up front that he will reach few conclusions and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets on tv and on the net what follows is a stream of consciousness depiction of life today i want more than that from gitlin i want his conclusions not some lame statement that he hasn t reached any yet he s not getting any younger lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives it s time for his masterpiece the next book perhaps,negative
by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers and was struck by the similarities and differences it s a great compare and contrast pair as an exercise for high schoolers both are written as first person accounts by teen aged girls and are roughly contemporary heart published in 1940 and castle in 1948 both about life in the 30s both families are poor in castle though there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs this is supposedly because they don t know how to do anything so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter how charming they are eccentric which seems enough in the author s eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper enamored of cassandra does work and gives the family his entire salary but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all even he is rewarded in the end able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step mum topaz striking poses unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark educated folks playing at being poor until they re rescued by romantic circumstance not so in america where mick kelly who didn t know how to do anything either went off to work at woolworth s and to a life of little hope in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina the inheritance two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle show up just in time with their chatty modern mum they throw money around and talk too much in the cliched extravagant american style most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being it s all so very charming bourgeois and harmless if your life is hard don t worry a man will show up to rescue you the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive smith was obviously talented her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition,negative
the climb was written by bourkeev and dewalt as an answer to krakaur s into thin air while not showcasing the same prose as krakaur s book i feel that this is utlamitely better my reasoning for this opinion is that the climb seems like a much more fair and unbiased account bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game he simply tells the story as he experienced it krakaur it seemed to me at least relied to heavily on assumptions and we all now what happens when you assume \( hint you make an out of you and me \) and came off as very arrogant and \( for some reason \) took a feverious dislike to bourkeev and lopsang thought not as well written as into thin air the climb still managed to draw me in fully although some parts of the book are a little confusing mainly the interview with bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed this interview was conducted in english the only problem with that is that bourkeev s english is not very strong it is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper dewalt tries to help by adding translations about what bourkeev is saying but i felt the interview should have been caried out in bourkeev s native tongue of russian and then translated into english to not have done this is a great injustice to bourkeev if you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the may 1996 everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money \( as krakaur s clearly was \) read this i really recommend you read both books though and also check out the imax movie everest,positive
this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths and underlying the story are indeed echoes sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted of ancient myths god is allegorized as gabalawi the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel the second that of moses and pharaoh the third that of jesus the fourth that of muhammad then there is a fifth story in which the central figure a magician is presumably a scientist he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi who had been easier to kill than to see it makes no difference the scientist who has invented a weapon of great destructive power is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever though they remain hopeful that one day magic will put an end to their suffering subtle the book is not either in content or in style and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent they mostly shout scream shriek yell cry or sneer which becomes rather tiresome the literary quality of this novel is i think greatly inferior to mahfouz s rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written it has been banned in egypt its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author s life,negative

this is the author s presentation of the satipatthana sutra the basic sutra on mindfullness as in all of his works he does the work of a good dharma teacher very well he keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student s understanding can arise naturally there are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the sutra in meditation but this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks the author gives a good commentary on the sutra and explains why he translates certain passages but he also gives the alternate interpretations this is a fine basic introduction to the central issue in vapassana meditation highly recommended,positive
the story is about peter growing up with his family in north dublin and is set in the 1960 s the tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers which his parents took in to supplement his father s income forms the backdrop to his story at 44 seville place the pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties the short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up beat throughout the whole of the book for those who have experienced dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time the metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed one example of this technique was when peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother frankie before frankie goes into surgery a joy to read da is the sun and all the minor planets revolve around him peter takes to his role as mercury the messenger with great relish there is a strong bond between father and son i feel this story should not be compared to frank mccourt s angela s ashes a one generation step into the future in ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced it was a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced however there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not be silenced,positive
this book is pretty much useless if you re looking for info on how to build a dulcimer only about 60 pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making repair the rest is a long winded history bio of homer ledford some of that is a bit interesting from an historical cultural perspective but the author beats it to death homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer the rest was the author s idea dean kimball s book on dulcimer making is better although still lacking in some areas this book has no patterns or plans few useful photos and is weak in what instruction it does provide there are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book,negative

i have never been a big fan of motivational books because they seem so pie in the sky if you know what i mean but a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different he was right it was easy to read and in fact i didn t want to put it down but what i really liked was the how to part of the book after all it s no good reading about other people s success stories if you don t know how to make your own also something i thought was interesting is that the author has a website called success compass which helps you set goals and then e mails you a reminder several times a day i guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want and this website doesn t let you forget hmmmmm electronic nagging as the key to success \) hey whatever works,positive

i recently decided to become vegetarian so i got this book to read i was very disapointed i think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals yet is written in a boring scientific way this book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians than to teenagers this book contains a lot of recipies and some of them sound good but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook i would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians but there are better books written for the teens themself this book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu i don t think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians there is enough of that without reading about it however if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won t hurt it is just a dissapointment,negative

before i bought the pasajes series i was relieved to see the \( then \) mostly positive reviews however i really feel like the overall review score of 4 5 stars is very very misleading i would not in good faith be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish 1 \) the concepts are not clearly explained \( they invented a new english word for one \) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary concepts to feel confident using them 2 \) frequently new words phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else via a footnote with no further explaination provided this is super frustrating and distracting 3 \) using this series of books is very cumbersome the books are not well coordinated with one another and do not appear to reinforce each other s concepts or vocabulary i m very sorry but these books are just terrible and 4 5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish which i used to enjoy if you have the option to use different books take it,negative
i did not read the book but i did look it over carefully i was hoping it would be a clear step by step guide to using ibd to apply the canslim method there is so much information in the paper that it is not easy to apply all the techniques in an efficient manner there are almost too many choices and directions possible this book is not a step by step guide nor is it all that clear i did find it to be unnecessarily wordy and vague it just seems to go over the whole paper in a long winded fashion but does not get down to the nuts and bolts of smart investing as i was hoping it would refer to william o neil s books for better guidance about how to invest also if you are a subscriber there is a large amount of useful information on the ibd website at investors com,negative

this novel could not hold my interest i am an anne perry fan but could not get into this book i couldn t really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting i m really disappointed because i was looking forward to a new series by her joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder yet there didn t seem to be much emotion maybe ms perry tried to tell too many stories within one story in reviewing the book it s hard to pin point exactly why i didn t like this book i would skip this series and read the pitt series,negative

in this book dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history he focuses primarily on the catholic church from dulles analysis there are five basic ways to understand the church he explores how these models have been used over time as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses in the rest of the book dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology he has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five my only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models the book is helpful however to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church it is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church all things considered this book is an asset to pastors students and anyone involved in ministry,positive

apparently the difference between a criminal act \( theft \) and moral redistribution of income is 1 \) who you steal from \( stealing from the wealthy of course is moral according to rawls and bolsheviks \) and 2 \) who receives the loot \( the non wealthy makes it moral \) and 3 \) who commits the act \( the state society of course also makes theft moral example taxation \) and 4 \) your intentions \( redistribution of income \) to look at this another way if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money that s a crime \( unless your neighbor is poor which would then be moral and justice according to rawls formula \) if the community comes into your house and steals from you it s legal and moral justice again according to rawls because according to rawls if before you were born you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured you d vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal or they would be compensated somehow for being born \( unjustly \) less equal how by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more so those with more would be like oh say a milk cow who gets milked to serve those with less so those with more would become a resource or state owned slaves to those with less because society \( the robin hoods and rawls of the world \) deemed this as moral justice rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk entrepreneurs students of life who work to earn an a vs students who earn an f he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own true but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference forcing the wealthier ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn t justice or moral it would simply be an unjust law some people see rawls theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia \( like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism \) i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery and a powerful dis incentive for earning personal reward and merit in a sense this book is an argument against the individual it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people he doesn t recognize any individuals \( unless they were born as victims \) curious how do you experience life as a group mind \( an oxymoron if there ever was one \) a collective or as a unique isolated independent individual there should be societal incentives to help each other okay but when it is forced \( theft of property always implies force \) it is no longer an issue of morality or justice it s simply a law without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue by definition transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom,negative
as a history major \( undergrad \) and former high school history teacher i marvel at crichton s ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way for this reason the great train robbery is for me my favorite crichton work even though it may lack the polish of jurassic park or congo or one of his more recent books tgtr takes us to 19th century london and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery as well as life in general in 19th century london so often history books give names dates connections but leave one with the question yes but what was it like crichton answers this better than any book i ever read on the sheep enclosure act or most any other dry text some of it may be fanciful but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text at any rate i highly recommend this book for any crichton fan master criminal fan or interested history student the main character whose name escapes me alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a hugo or dumas novel very fascinating and rapidly moving,positive

lawsuit that was eventually dismissed the position instead went to china scholar orville schell who according to weiner was less qualified than himself savage was hired by msnbc to do a one hour show starting march 8 2003 on july 7 a mere four months later he was fired for making anti gay remarks in response to a caller later identified as prank caller east coast bob savage was doing an airline horror stories piece when bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom his next words were half hour into the flight i need to suggest that don and mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad the words after should were bleeped out by a msnbc exec which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about savage s sexual orientation savage asked if he was a sodomite to which the caller answered yes savage then said to the caller oh so you re one of those sodomites you should only get aids and die you pig how s that why don t you see if you can sue me you pig you got nothing better to do than to put me down you piece of garbage you got nothing better to do today go eat a

on no more calls i don t care about these bums they mean nothing to me they re all sausages 6 before the show was canceled msnbc was replaying his show during primetime hours saturday night many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments and that msnbc was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups others point out that msnbc has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network,negative
ok you guys as i have stated this book let me down it practically ends on page 195 and there s still 65 pages to go my advice don t even start it also i tried the killer s cousin i wasn t pleased with that either so my conclusion if you re looking for a good read don t expect nanxy werlin to fulfill your needs if you need good suspenseful stories try lois duncan or caroline b cooney one great outstanding wonderful book swimmer graham masterton,negative
i m a big koontz fan and as is generally the case i greatly enjoyed this story it was a little strange but that s to be expected from this author and genre that said it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book it had the curious sense of near division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not in my opionion as well connected as in many of koontz s other books in addition the ending seemed a little hasty thus i gave it four rather than five stars that said i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author s work,positive
the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into leadership by calling and comparisons to it with modern leadership theory les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion a point with which i agree unfortunately some of the examples he chooses are questionable after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack \( which jack says he would abandon if needed \) while still making the tough decisions that got the results for the shareholders jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results ok also there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home unfortunately the theme in csorba s examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance it s a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work it started off so well it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust able leader unfortunately this conservative political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it they would simply say its a bush ie right winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise too bad csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual i say this even though i am republican am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election am a person of faith and tend to find the dems an easy target but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics too bad,negative
obviously from all the reviews this book appeals to many people i am not one of them perhaps it s because i don t care for science fiction i found the writing stilted the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them the story boring and the ending \( covered in the introduction \) to be a twilight zone cliche if like me you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed,negative
in the grand tradition of rational corp this is an overpriced book from rational corp to complement its overpriced software i must commend the healthcare example in the book that is described in fair detail the book s website is empty and does not supplement the book s content only contains a link to order the book and an email to contact the authors if you have to buy it buy a used copy or read the free marketing stuff on the rational website,negative

this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is \( there isn t a single clue at any point in time \) the heroine keeps loosing her memory so you don t even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine \( since she can t even remember much about herself much less him \) if you like kay go ahead and read it but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard,negative
some of patterson s conclusions were a bit of a reach some of his segways weren t all that smooth but this book is just plain entertaining it is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the devil lingering around after death and backed up with just enough innuendo ish research for it to almost be believable well some of it actually believable patterson scribes on about various rockstar occult alliances \( in particular the rolling stones and led zeppelin \) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves,positive
there are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up this book has no bibliography no index mediocre footnotes no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary and a disturbing combination of american centrism \( on page 71 in the asian continent \( t \) he first driver will be the future u s role in asia \) with a lack of intelligent presentation there are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries the world conflict and human rights map \( 8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print \) out of leiden university does vastly more to inform than does this book this book should never ever have been published in its present form i venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited with graphics and good synthesis it might be worthy of a second look time is the most precious commodity in the world rand managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what rand thinks but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined even lazy preparations the topic of this book is extremely important those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book,negative

to cover all the problems with continuity logic theology geography and plain common sense in left behind would take a whole book one hardly knows where to start perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel as such it isn t even a decent trashy novel instead of steamy sex scenes we get sanctimonious sermonizing worse than that what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it s too late the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario \( an idea with virtually no scriptural support \) little in the characters actions thought processes or dialog rings true one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student god ends up looking like the ultimate villain demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear who is the present day equivalent of c s lewis or catherine marshall and why aren t they getting more attention these were writers who actually made you think lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non believers in such a world might ask one wonders if they have ever met a non believer at all or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter these days it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted bigoted caricature of what it once was perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured if left behind is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind,negative

a generation before there was a left behind there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c c carlson this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america a phemomenal best seller it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry for many christians their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future a generation later many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism well while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other prophecy pundits while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form for lahaye and jerry b jenkins it was the pulp novel back in 1970 lindsay and c c carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day the sensationalistic expose like most books of this type \( e g the bermuda triangle chariots of the gods the philadelphia experiment the population bomb \) it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts like most of these books it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams like most of these books it is laughable in retrospect if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong after all it was the 1970 s when wild conspiracy theories distrust of any traditional authority and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age a ufo invasion a famine around the corner and california falling into the pacific ocean the authors claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy however in the intervening years the revisions of this book just kept piling up make a bad prediction no problem edit the book with the old gaffes removed add a few trendier predictions and release it as a new book lindsey now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis \( carleton s contribution is more stylistic \) despite his failed scenarios lindsey s original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s \( he even wrote a book the 1980 s countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief \) well that didn t pan out so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon \( another of his books was planet earth 2000 a d will mankind survive \) oops wrong again first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam \( a more recent book is the everlasting hatred the roots of jihad \) when one bogeyman falls he is quick to insert a new one in its place between the failed predictions the hilarious misreadings of the original languages the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies right before our eyes it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs notably the left behind series of novels if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night however for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy it is best to pass for all its success as a cultural marker its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil for this its original purpose the late great planet earth is completely worthless,negative
despite the fact that hanegraaff s name is the bigger of the two on the front cover only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading and they are the writing of paul maier his research is helpful but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn t given a week end to write it and come up with as much as he could every topic needs futher information a lot more could be said and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere that said i would give this book to someone who isn t much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions it isn t much more than a collection of scattered soundbites but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction,negative
i love this book it is a terrific blend of hand holding and concrete advice for writers each chapter takes the writer reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write how do we begin where do ideas come from is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin i like the fact that i could use this book as a resource in other words i did not have to read it cover to cover rather it truly serves as a guide a mentor s guide that can serve me as i continue to write i really liked the movie section where cathleen rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process i found those sections inspirational and useful if you want to be a writer or if you are already writing i urge you to buy this book,positive

this story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing it clearly establishes a sense of time and place \( modern day madison wisconsin \) and offers the promise of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of als \( lou gehrig s disease \) from the perspective of a personal caregiver while we learn to understand the struggles of the patient kate this is more about the struggles of a college student known as bec as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own author michelle wildgen fulfills the promise this story is character driven and what made me turn the pages wasn t the story which was at times a bit slow and uninspiring with the exception of the blue butterfly the additional sex scenes felt extraneous further one can guess from the beginning that in terms of kate s condition there wouldn t be a happy ending regardless wildgen paints a very realistic picture of als and definitely puts you in the room what made me turn the pages was wildgen s ability to make each of her characters come alive i cared about them and wanted to see how they d handle kate s progressive and ultimate demise bec is the narrator who learns as she goes \( both how to take care of kate and how to cook for her guests staff family \) we see everything through her eyes particularly as she becomes kate s voice the title you re not you comes from kate as she asks bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation the secondary characters are also well developed including kate s husband evan bec s roommate jill and to a lesser degree bec s lover liam liam a married faculty member represents another dimension of bec s floundering and her search to in a sense pick a major ultimately the story becomes a vehicle for bec s eventual direction of career choice i recommend as a thought provoking read and for the strong writing and character development additionally if you know \( or have known \) someone with als i believe you ll appreciate the author s knowledge and sensitivity from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group,positive

typical feinstein \( a season on the brink excepted \) quick gossipy superficial fawning etc etc this book is about the 2002 u s open golf championship at the bethpage black golf course a new york state park course on long island the subtitle inside the ropes at bethpage black is used here as a figure of speech meaning behind the scenes \( inside the ropes is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself spectators are separated from the golfers caddies officials and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action \) feinstein s purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion we see u s golf association \( the organization that conducts the tournament \) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament \( e g 4 850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and u s g a can have a huge payday \) about random qualifiers and random competitors and about the resurrection of the black golf course yet the book does not fulfill its promise my guess is that feinstein s indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis i had hoped for,negative
i ll be blunt i didn t care for this book i bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the gnostic sophia instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions her i really think the title was misleading as a sidenote lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of gnosis,negative
this volume contains 152 middle length sutras which are mainly sermons to monks on buddhist practices having compared the pali original with the translation of about 12 sutras i would give it a high fidelity rating the appendix contains extensive notes which discuss the text from the viewpoint of the theravada commentaries a must read for those who want to learn or study using original source material and do not read pali the introduction contains valuable material on buddhism by a bhikkhu long gone forth,positive
in all the talk about education issues these days it s easy to forget that what s really important is the relationship the energy between students and teacher when the teacher closes his door and is face to face with thirty kids that s where it s at it s not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum it s what happens between people in a classroom this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager active kids and a caring active teacher it s not all pleasant and successes are sometimes small but a pervasive caring underlies it all as a teacher this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork go for a walk go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day,positive

heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention unfortunately these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein s final books we are also treated to some of heinlein s stock characters dirty old men horny female computers naked adolescent girls and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed as if this isn t enough heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing in spite of all their cameo appearances this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout heinlein s earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people especially boys this novel as well as most of heinlein s later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption,negative
ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology so she attacks without understanding she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people s work she denigrates maslow s hierarchy of needs is one example i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers and william coulson as instructors any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book her bias is extreme and obvious so consider this when reading the book no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology,negative
i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown s books in the past decade her early books were utterly magnificent now she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite \( and by now utterly boring \) themes southern manners horse bloodlines and foxhunting blessedly whisker of evil was foxhunting free but suffered from a heavy handed overload of the previous two rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia and many of us have grace manners and respect for others and we don t take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things that s just simply not true that said there were some delightful aspects of whisker of evil the mystery itself was great the animal characters were adorable as ever and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick her quitting the post office was a great \( and very unexpected \) twist i liked reading more about her home and her relationships however the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me was this directed at a heretofore unknown segment of rita mae brown s fan base it was so out of context in this book certain details contributed to the horses relationships to one another but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages as well i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners this is a common theme of ms brown s and it is quite frankly offensive there is a big big world outside of virginia rita mae brown should know this she has lived in it but her books and characters have become so parochial insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue in cheek if it wasn t such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade enough already about southern manners \( a biased perception at best \) ancestor worship bloodlines \( human and horse \) and foxhunting whatever happened to characters like celeste chalfonte,negative
\( 3 75 \) the other reviews can reveal what this book is about what i wanted to share is the extreme responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me he alternately found himself loving the narrator yuriko s sister for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of kazue meanwhile i found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of kazue s meritocratic dreams but a moment later i wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator perhaps it reminded me too much of what i had seen growing up to shock me then there was the simultaneous hilarity and pain of kazue s cluelessness was she a tragic figure blind or both i admired kirino for inspiring me to feel so much for her characters even for yuriko who is certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to believe she is \( i also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly as she considered herself in her 30s is it just because women past 25 in japan are regarded as christmas cake as a friend from japan says \) my attention was quite strained by zhang s tale of chinese hardship \( it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader about how difficult it is for immigrants in japan \) but i immediately forgave kirino when yuriko s older sister admitted herself zhang s account was tedious and could be skipped \( i d recommend others to skim it as well \) again my patience was tested by kazue s journal i just kept on thinking aren t you ready to die yet but i see this was intentional on kirino s part to make the reader struggle between our \( or my \) wanting kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our coldness and complicity in her bullying it also made my boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our own lives who were heading towards the same fate as kazue and yuriko not through prostitution but through drugs what did disappoint me in the end was the last chapter which seemed a cop out if only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and encouraged her that an alternative though more shocking would be more in line with the narrator s character but that is wishful thinking on my part when i give this book to others which i will i will make sure to discuss with them when they ve finished what they thought of the ending this book could have been edited down a hundred pages \( back when it was written in japanese \) but for what it did offer i have no regrets for its consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to further translations of kirino s books this book may not be the masterpiece out was but for anyone who has gone to an elite school on scholarship striven to remain a petite zero wanted to excel while recognizing how off the mark our values of judgment are or wondered just how much her body could be worth reading grotesque is just as powerful an experience as reading out was,positive
i have to give philippa gregory a big thank you for approaching this story from a different perspective from the other boleyn girl it delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of english royalty and wealth again i was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events there were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end i was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book so if you are deciding whether or not you d like to read this after having read the other boleyn girl i greatly encourage you to do so you won t regret it,positive

reviewer alianore s opinion rather too indulgent of its subject is a very accurate portrayal of weir s work i will try to add something to that near perfect review \( note i listened to the unabridged audiobook of queen isabella 22 hrs on 18 cds \) the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable loaded with period details the last third is the worst weir s fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation nay elevation of queen isabella to the role of long suffering much wronged highly deserving and late redeemed just queen of england this book is really subjective rhetorical biographal dramatization i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis it is rhetoric because of the endless weasel words \( and expressions \) used copiously throughout some say it has been said many believe therefore we may assume it can be inferred this isn t just an attribute of her style it is her style comprehensively these expressions occur many hundreds of times commonly in conjunction with wier s subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons equally irksome is weir s double standard of historical psychological analysis she is always declaring for us the contents of isabella s thoughts remarkable gift she has for this many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful but then moments later she will portray isabella s actions from a 21st century point of view always telling the reader how isabella must have might have could have would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history this isn t historical writing it is historical op ed with an obvious agenda i don t loathe this work it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography \( other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris rise of theodore roosevelt and theodore rex i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence yuck really \) if prefer more history when reading \( or listening to \) history and much much less editorial subjectivity retroactive psychology biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation the only way i could enjoy isabella by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly taking it with several pounds of salt as the above referenced reviewer advises 2 5 5,negative
the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj s guilt there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge you won t learn anything new from this book it has a long list of books on the subject but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them were they all equal in quality the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news could it have been intended as a distraction from other news in may 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war this was repeated weekly in 1999 i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea \( must have been a success since the propaganda stopped \) could the double murders in brentwood have been well publicized as a distraction isn t two murders a day the usual la statistics how many other waiters \( just from mezzaluna \) were murdered each year are murders by organized crime often solved the book killing time noted that restaurants and health clubs \( in la and elsewhere \) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution if this explains the murders you won t find much in this book my experience is that most white americans made up their minds in june 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment,negative
the author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel her sentences are long and wordy and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context she goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content her descriptions of life in general seem unreal she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance the storyline is decent in some places but it is generally hard for the reader to follow many times i had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going it is true there were many points in which i wanted to stop reading all together which is a rarity i was altogether disappointed in the book i thought it would be decent from all the literary awards it had won but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose,negative

paul johnson has written a 1 000 page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815 1830 years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today johnson s chosen foci are certainly broad he ranges from events in politics and law to music science and even opium use while almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function johnson s roving eye and pen can be disconcerting he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning also while the book claims to be about world society johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about british society but he s found plenty of ways to range geographically from the western united states \( like kentucky \) to china and singapore throughout his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read overall johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading a vast book that one can pick up open nearly at random and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today,positive
this book was great it read well and never was too slow it was fair to both sides of the war and the leaders who fought the battles and planned the campaign it was complete in that it discussed the men tactics weapons and terrain in the southern campaign not only was this book a great souce for the southern war but it also gave good insight into the revolutionary war in general if you re interested in this topic and want to increase you re knowledge of the southern war get this book it s informative as well as pleasing to read,positive
this is another piece of lowbrow anti german propaganda dressed as historiography the book is a mess of primary yet selective and biased historical research simplistic psycho babble ridiculous sociological anthropological speculation pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least absolutely third rate military history the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives all in all cheap trash billed as history,negative
i liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer is that logical at all the senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father if he had the senator when he was twenty he d have to be 77 is it really reasonable that he s running around killing people and setting houses on fire it was a very unlikely twist to the end it still was a good book,positive

i ve always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate and that rate has sped up since i m now a romance coach but somehow i had missed susan page s if i m so wonderful why am i still single even though it has been out since 1998 the last year i was single myself where have i been and why hadn t i seen this book susan page writes for involuntary singles straight gay male or female each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren t relentlessly positive she starts off right to the point with so why are you still single anyway and then just when we ve gotten over that shock she states flatly whatever your reasons are for being single if you want to be in a relationship no reason is good enough then page goes about tearing apart every good reason we ve ever come up with to keep ourselves single here s what page takes on and turns around ambivalence \( my favorite \) those dreadful statistics the myth of there are no good ways to meet people and having and keeping high standards then she works on developing skills in what she calls frog kissing learning to say no how to recognize true intimacy avoiding commitmentphobes handling the intimacy gap and learning to say yes and in the last section keeping it all together while you look page tells you just how to do all that this is easily the best most thorough rounded and positive book about relationships and dating i have seen if you are one of page s involuntary singles this book needs to be in your library five chocolate dipped strawberries for susan page this is quite a book,positive
tourists are learning that the image of the terrible turk is false created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors turks are quick to remind visitors that surrounded by syria iraq iran armenia georgia bulgaria and greece they re not living in mr rogers neighborhood this is a direct quote it sounds like they re trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of turkey which is amusing since he listed both greece and armenia there which were both targeted by turkey either this writing staff has no idea what they re writing and is just happy to sell books thinking no one will double check the info or they re racist and opinionated either way i wouldn t trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go,negative
i think in retrospect i wasted my time on this one it had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me as i read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery i kept on hoping that there would be something more to it something more enigmatic a brilliant twist but i was left with despair my major problem with this novel was there were not enough in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer and bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities i will never touch this author s book again a mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best dan brown,negative
i really enjoyed this book i could pore over the fashions the interior decoration it satisfied my desire to see all the details at the same time i got a sense of the passage of time in virginia and vanessa s lives read as a companion to any of woolf s novels i think the book would also convey a sense of the writing process it evokes the time and place beautifully and the text is not intrusive the images are allowed to take centre stage as works of art in their own right fine choice sweetpea,positive

i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women s movement that as such it fills a long felt want and that it is to be recommended to those new to unfamiliar with or who feel they should be allied with the women s movement it would it will make an excellent text for those doing women s studies as to those doing social movement studies whether globally or more locally summarising antrobus shows the women s movement as political as recognising women s relationship to social conditions as processal as posed against patriarchal privilege as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation marginalisation isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation one complaint but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone this is the avoidance of the word capitalism even by feminists who are or were once socialists capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus capitalists mostly after all male white and patriarchal call it capitalism and are proud of it so why cannot it not be so named by feminists who could and surely should condemn it this cannot be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political economic determinism of patriarchal socialists so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonf hig \( acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking to the funders they are dependent upon \) or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder gentler global capitalism a global neo keynesian order for which no convincing feminist case has been made pity,positive

after reading the trilogy i was left wondering what the hell happened i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story one of the most creative stories i ve come across in 20 years of reading fantasy there isn t even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess if you look up anticlimax in the dictionary you ll see a picture of this book from first page to last time is wasted on boring characters while all the good ones are either killed off or just mia for the entire book spoilers ahead what about lyra and her parents somehow she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops over a cup of tea naturally and that s it for him in addition to all that this book doesn t even seem to be connected to the first two none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 all in the last 30 pages what happened to the story for cripes sake and what happened to the temptation was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it the whole premise is just so lame to start out with as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn t endanger the universe why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another supposedly they had more than gonads going for them they survived death together pullman didn t feel like thinking it through he just wanted a gut wrenching ending in addition to that he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the reality of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning all of will and lyra s efforts are futile kind of like guess what religion for the rest of us morons after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa elephant aliens or whatever ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper iorek byrnison lee scoresby instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter this is not children s literature it s a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess it s totally dishonest to sell this as a children s book or even as a competent work of fiction all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one we never get closure on lyra s parents we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from we never see will reunited with his mother we get a lame battle where god dies and no one even knows why or how lyra and will fall in love but have to sacrifice it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever with only flimsy reasoning behind it the mulefa and mary malone s work together amounts to nothing everyone just goes home presumably will goes home although we never see it all that yearning after his mother and so forth nothing the major enemies are killed off too easily and what about armageddon what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and you get the idea it all just sort of disovles mary forgot to be the serpent or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa another reader pointed out phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series instead the story falls flat under the weight of the author s own agendas and mockeries what a waste of time i can t believe this book actually won awards it stopped being thought provoking and started being inane and silly it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream instead relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime absurd this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life,negative

i am finding this book quite helpful to getting to know myself better and to have greater control over my emotional responses or mood the authors guide you through several approaches of specific steps you should take to get to know some of your core beliefs which they say may be causing depression you are free to choose the approach that works best for you but you do need to try them all to see what works it is quite time consuming one of the approaches requires you to record your activities and asses your mood every hour the instructions are clear and concice and examples provided are helpful however it does take a true commitment i suppose it may be fair to say that true change most often does take real work,positive

the great locomotive chase is the stuff of legend this somewhat obscure event which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days to second manassas to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union but first time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms telling it well and placing it in its proper context the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue espionage and derring do and if mr bonds had only told the tale itself this book would be well worth the read but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr bonds s ability to tell this gripping tale objectively while putting it in its proper context the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas and by doing so and by explaining why the raid coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war mr bonds gives the otherwise reckless lan of the raiders its proper place andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark even though students of the era will have the natural reaction what were they thinking mr bonds answers that question and the answer as incongruous as it may seem reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished this would be a wonderful adventure story in the great tradition of shelby foote s narrative history of the war but this book does so much more it puts the raid in its proper strategic context and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well told,positive

the best book on the history of world war ii that i ve read in a long time the title has three meanings 1 it can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber the brits called these people rear gunners the yanks used the term tail gunner it s the most dangerous position in the plane 2 the last plane in the formation this was more true in the american combat box than in british usage this position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation it is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there aren t so many guns pointing that direction 3 it can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war this splendid book covers all three of these meanings in addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of germany,positive

ok i know i m going to get hammered for this once again there goes my reviewer rating but i just have to be honest this is a terrible story ok being that it s shakespeare it s prettily told but it s still a horrible story and i can t imagine why otherwise sensible people like it perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue in cheek \( it is a comedy after all \) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not that would almost make it tolerable if i could believe it but given that it is a shakespearean comedy we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a happy one and the situation at the end is far from pleasant or perhaps people believe \( i ve heard this claimed in all seriousness \) that kate has actually triumphed at the end having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly even if this were true i d hardly consider it a happy anding and personally i see little evidence of it no what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman \( some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it \) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who tames her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse \( he doesn t beat her simply starves her and sleep deprives her as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives her spirit may or may not be broken depending on how the part is played but the fact remains that she s forced to behave as if it is and that s not a message that should be bruited about in a comedy this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare s plays,negative

casual book browsers who stumble across braden s book the isaiah effect might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title that there exists some mystical unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques research and understanding i as one such browser had briefly read about the so called bible code which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related with my interest piqued at the title and the book description i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah s precise instructions of prayer i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon what i found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new thought concepts the mixing of religions for example a sort of pick and choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades is recycled over and over again drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science his basic premise of the effect is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel and the world of turning away from him to braden s credit his discussions of the effects of prayer in today s society are commemorable albeit somewhat misguided i agree with him that people in today s society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they ve surrounded themselves however i believe braden over emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer he fails to discuss how humans and their emotions are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer not cosmic emotions and human feelings a disappointing read,negative
how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding,negative

the case for faith is the weakest volume in a strong series strobel s format is fun and engaging i find his books as un put downable as any blockbuster page turner strobel holds a degree from yale law school and he was an award winning legal editor at the chicago tribune he begins with a question does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus does current science support the existence of a creator god does it make sense to have faith in god and then travels north america interviewing acknowledged academic experts on the question at hand some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web protest but strobel s books aren t fair because he only presents one side perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books the first three words of each title is the case for no strobel is not presenting the case against his topic he doesn t represent himself as doing so our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly why should strobel waste paper and time doing that when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing strobel s accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader friendly but he never talks down to his reader if you don t want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing but want to get to the nub of the issue strobel is your man these techniques worked excellently in the case for a creator and the case for christ but less well in the case for faith there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks in the introduction strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton templeton presents a righteous enraged case against god and then tearfully admits how much he continues to adore jesus and indeed to miss him this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love hate relationship with their creator in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one which addresses the question of suffering strobel s friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith even in the face of profound suffering in another brief passage strobel tells of his friend ron bronski who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book they were the most rewarding to read the formal interviews with the experts didn t do a lot for me and some were alienating norman geisler s treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns it may be true that in war children are killed with their adults when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey too there is doubt if not complete disbelief among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place \( see israel finkelstein \) the chapter entitled church history is littered with oppression and violence was especially weak compared to other treatments of the same material strobel s treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper s work strobel doesn t handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace weak christian ideas about humanity s unity as god s children and the value of all life this is not made clear enough in strobel s account all in all i have to say i ve encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books and yet strobel is such a good writer and his technique is so engaging that you could do worse than to read this book read the other two books in the series first though,positive
i have no personal experience with 12 step programs nor do i have dominant addictions \( other than book and dvd buying \) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking over eating and love addictions in particular i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients this book takes a rational emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal and often over generalised attacking crusade against 12 step programs some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12 step programs were valid and useful similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12 step programs and in very derogatory judgmental language he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements \( and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered \) i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language he could have suggested modified views and tools and alternatives to consider i can t imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12 step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground,negative

i read this book on vacation many years ago i read in the shoes of the fisherman and the clowns of god i enjoyed both of these books but not enought to search out and read the third book in the trilogy what a mistake this book contains the politics of power the behind the scenes strugles and the fears and doubts as well as the faith and triumphs of the servants of the vatican as well as the italian and international scene the relationships both formed forming and parting kept me glued to the book the pace was fast and enthralling do not miss this book the end was somewhat predictable but never the less still shocking,positive

a surprisingly tiny book \( the picture in the upper left corner is nearly actual size \) after receiving it i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page it says 4 7 x 3 3 x 0 6 i had not noticed that before i ordered it the book seems much smaller than that not that that is a problem it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you ll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading for one thing the pages are much too small for emergency tp use not that i am complaining mind you this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from the amish to zero \( this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text but who cares the book is fun \) each page has its stated fact and a follow up paragraph to expound on the subject also there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three instant personalities each little tidbits of info about famous people \( although thomas jefferson got his own page as did alfred hitchcock \) and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently \( bla bla \) the information here is actually correct will and mangesh research their topics not just publish un provable facts gathered from the internet use the contents with confidence,positive

this is an extraordinary biography for while blumenson s admiration for george patton is evident it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of patton s personality both positive and negative the book truly goes beyond the popular perception of the general and far beyond the movie in exploring his character and motivations not an overly long book but thorough detailed and very enjoyable to read,positive
i disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless i think it easily earns 4 5 5 stars it is over a decade old now and i don t think it is intended as a source for scholars of english but for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read i can t compete with some of the above reviewer s scholarly points but i don t think replacing some of bryson s dogma with their own is worthwhile mother tongue is a great starting point and very educational bryson s dictionary of troublesome words is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me,positive

the player provided a trip back in time to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century through the times of the first world war to understand what mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control he realized that he was a role model for others not only the young kids that idolized him but the everyday american worker to know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field his charity work volunteering for wwi at the age of 37 gives us a better insight to the individual the book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game before the black sox scandal he knew it was going on tried to warn others but no one would listen a great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time one that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today s game,positive

black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african american studies a classic work of sociology that still resonates today it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology however a school that today stands in some disrepute at least in some circles indirectly it was the target of james baldwin s famous attack on richard wright in his essay everybody s protest novel the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school due to its insistance upon using a scientific approach merely reproduces the very terms under which african americans have been oppressed a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno still black metropolis is a landmark study and unfortunately many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse not better since 1945 the year of black metropolis publication which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society since then as we know we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days so much so in fact that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book embodying american liberalism as it does which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look,positive
so this page turning thriller was on the best selling list for a gazillion months and put catholic and fellow christian faithful in a defensive uproar i m fairly well read and yes i ve earned a few bucks with my prose i m also a sucker for historic tales ancient folklore mythology and old testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits ok i decided now that it s in paperback i ll give it a read what i concluded was this those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown s work is a literary steaming pile i read page after page waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat s ass about the da vinci code s protagonists what a bunch of twits langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology \( i don t know if i spelled that right but i m not about to go back in that book and check it \) apparently there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon s books sell better than brown s entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who s easy on the eyes someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn t a dipwad like landgon she s got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough but she s been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high falluting most french probably couldn t tolerate it and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near \( but of course \) versaille this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro so he s been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything or something like that oh i forgot teabing s crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him anyway this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do make lofty self affirmed pronouncments about how the world s going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag the point is that these characters aren t very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it hell it s been more than 100 years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world but back to how bad this book is trite doesn t begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase i would give you some examples but like i said i m not going back in there one of the more laughable scenes of upper crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor by now sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times been on the run and are exhausted with a straight face brown describes how sophie s delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by crumpets yes crumpets hell teabing shut up about your conspiracy theories roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat offer langdon a stiff drink i sure needed one at this point by now i m pulling for the albino then they escape the jaws of death yet again and naturally high tail it to england on teabing s private jet i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he d left his grey poupon behind i stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the albino wasn t going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists i don t know how it ends i don t care however there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery who knows you might like it this is just my opinion,negative

i m almost finished reading this book and what a long fun ride it s been wordy and a little confusing this book has to be taken in the right mood or else you ll miss the humor the places that the main character travels to are memorable and exciting and i found myself getting through a hefty portion without thinking that i had ever started some no more like most of the satire is cryptic and hard to find however i read up on the book and it immediately popped out at me and made alot more sense this is an excellent book that i m sure you will enjoy it might even suit as a read aloud story for younger children,positive
it is interesting to see how golems evolve from pratchett s discworld novel feet of clay \( 1996 \) where they are speechless slaves of clay to going postal \( 2004 \) where a well educated but humorless golem serves as body guard and lecturer in morals to the new post master this is where it all begins commander sir samuel vimes of ankh morpork s night watch pays a visit to the dragon king of arms at the urging of his new wife who thinks sam needs his own coat of arms now that he s been knighted unfortunately one of sam s ancestors was a regicide so his descendent is denied an armorial bearing by the college of heralds he does learn that one of his watchmen is actually the earl of ankh the inimitable corporal nobbs who is forced to carry around a piece of paper signed by ankh morpork s patrician certifying that he s really human well this is a bit of a come down for sir sam but he s got more important matters on his mind including the murders of two harmless old men one of them was beaten to death by a loaf of dwarf bread his body was discovered by captain carrot and corporal angua the only werewolf in the night watch when they visited the dwarf bread museum on their day off the only link between the two corpses is a trace of white clay at both murder scenes subplots zigzag every which way through feet of clay corporal earl of ankh nobbs is being courted by a group of well nobs who haven t given up on the notion that ankh morpork should be ruled by a king captain carrot hereditary king of ankh morpork who wisely refused the crown in men at arms is busy tracking murderers and emancipating golems sargeant colon is about to retire if he lives through a trip through the sewers with wee mad arthur corporal angua helps a new dwarf recruit come to terms with her yen to wear lipstick death who has at least a walk on role in all the discworld fantasies is still working on his sense of humor i am death not taxes i turn up only once if this sounds confusing it isn t it s brilliant all of the story lines tie together according to character i don t know how pratchett digs through the sewers and stockyards of ankh morpork and rubs together a monarchist plot with a bit of animated clay to create such a gem i think he must use magic,positive
i purchased this book several months ago during that time i ve tried several of the recipes the french lentil soup is very good the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing the chili was so so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste the recipe for mushroom french lentil and chestnut ragu says to see glossary for the chestnuts but there s nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts it wasn t until i read another recipe \( smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup \) that chestnuts were discussed the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster far too much red onion \( which my guests mostly picked out \) although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare as someone who works full time a 20 ingredient recipe holds very little allure no matter how good it sounds i had trouble finding some of the ingredients for example the author specifies several different types of squash which i haven t been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer s markets the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents if you re looking for a specific recipe you ll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop,negative

more than anything else alan furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of world war ii espionage i a serebin inhabits the urbane world of russian emigres in the europe of 1940 1941 mainly in paris but also in roumania serebin is recruited into what seems to be the british secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of roumanian oil to the nazi war machine the whole operation reeks of amateurism appropriate enough at that stage of the war brainy careful daring but amateur with one exception none of the players know completely what they are part of which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line still furst s prose forms the characters into full dimensional beings from bogart s casablanca or graham greene s human factor highly recommended for readers with an interest in espionage or ww ii,positive

i so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book i read it recently for a book club selection and let me tell you if i didn t have to read it i would have put it down after the first twenty pages and never picked it up again i found it to be dark depraved disgusting and depressing an examination of love in all it forms hardly these characters were just plain goofy i finally figured it out towards the end of the book these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually they were looking to other humans to provide them with true love and that is just barking up the wrong tree i am giving it one star only for the rich use of language,negative
the book is well written most parts of it i can agree with but there is a crucial mistake in parson s message oneness likes to play separation i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation duality ego is simply a mistake illusion caused by mind evolution saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion also his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the mercy of something and this is clearly very dualistic without ego both doing and not doing are actions of oneness to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake there are many illuminating sentenses in this book but be aware of the neo advaitan trap in my life it was understanding especially of the process of ego illusion image helped me to come to oneness the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness there is no duality in doing and not doing at right this moment you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop of courses you make choices in daily life if you really understand what is meant by nond duality you will not make such statements such as there is no choice,negative
alright for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals or lacking in substance i say this who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are who is rand to say what substance is you ve got to look at her bias first realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom as if outside factors never matter and maybe they don t for her maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today but i doubt it though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live outside influences do affect a person but she doesn t thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap all books that are not driven solely by the individual s sense of reason don t read cause it will lessen your iq any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn t find worthwhile or cannot understand she condemns rand at least as portrayed in what i ve read of her work is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality they are either good or worthless the pieces of art she says are empty are empty absolutely they don t fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer nothing to offer her that is how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history s best books telling other people \( with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual \) what they should read truthfully any criticism in this form like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world is elitist crap trying to close people s minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others they have their bias like anyone else i say read in variety observe art outside of rand s choice of art take in all you can with an open mind then start pondering whether you agree or not if you then agree because you agree then i say great its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address she says question society but by my line of inquiry she says be an individual but only i know the basis of who you want to be,negative
this book describes the eleven year psychotherapy process for a woman with sixteen different personalities the analysis process took place from 1954 through 1965 sybil the subject of the book was a child of the 1920 s and 30 s and her multiple personality disease was a result of her family s genetic history and her fundamentalist repressed and abusive upbringing much of sybil s struggles were due to the time period in which she lived her family had mental illness but felt that ignoring it and focusing on other pursuits was the best course of action she was so denied the exploration of her feelings that she choked back all symptoms of mental illness and tried to act normal hindering her recovery for years i am still in shock over the patience and dedication that was required to work with the frustratingly different personalities over a period of eleven years i got frustrated at the slow and relapse prone re integration process at the end of the book and i admire schreiber for painstakingly recounting the process instead of using hollywood style short cuts sybil s recovery and emergence as a complete functional woman in her forties was a very hard won victory during the revealing of sybil s personalities i really liked vicky she was the all seeing personality who know the lineage of all others i liked her better than i liked the backbone less sybil and i wanted her to exist for this lost woman during the personality integration process i learned that all of the personalities were a part of sybil and such exaggerated emotion as vicky s had to be integrated in to part of the whole sybil overall this is an amazing book that well stands the test of time,positive

i can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training here s the problem the book and cd basically outlines a method of ear training it is not ear training itself for example for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the cd it is just that an example not a training so there is one 14 note lesson on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals i don t think so however if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals you could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that s the core of ear training in fact if you re an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords by the way the cd itself mostly uses really dull organ patches the idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction however since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone this is another example of how this book cd in itself won t be of much use to students,negative

this fantastic re imagining of the avengers is best consumed in this form yes there are too many pop culture references yes the hulk is a little goofy and the ultimate nick fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but i think once your done with this gigantic thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about this story arc takes the alternate universe avengers from their creation to their first major victory ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good the second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well this is the best that the ultimate universe has to offer is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers no inline skates teen angst or first love in this one millar and hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd these thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and i read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand my wife got her msw in the time it took the skrull war to unfold it sucked and the new series isnt much better thankfully it has only one issue to go hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin yes it s just a super hero comic but its one of the best so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a favor and check it out and keep an eye out for the second series hardcover,positive

how can a best selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze fest one answer write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases another strive to break the record for most clich s in a single paragraph finally write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon simon and the raccoons simon on the failing american economy simon attempting to reproduce american accents this is a cd set for avoiding,negative

the previous review is clear about the value of this translation knowing a bit of german i can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for gestalten the real value of the work beyond the translation however especially for first time readers is found in the notes made by david luke these notes are helpful for the historical context allusions to goethe s personal life and work and allusions to philosophy literature and more all essential to understanding the work,positive
this book refers to philosophical basis of buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion it is not a manual nor a guide no meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book the style is simbolic and poetical it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content it will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work,negative
this book really wasn t at all what i was expecting or what the title would lead one to believe the subtitle in search of grace o malley and other legendary women of the sea makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o malley with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers not so the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information i knew almost nothing about grace o malley going into the book and i know little more than that now the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail and most of them aren t even real historical figures but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids she even talks about pippi longstocking not what i was expecting at all the pirate queen is actually devoted far more to sjoholm s travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study she describes the inns she stayed at the weather the tourists she met her own childhood the abundance of personal bath mats in northern european hotels almost everything but grace o malley and her cohorts in fact the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm a story which to be quite honest i really couldn t care less about i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures it turned out to be a travel memoir and a comparatively uninteresting one at that this is a shame really sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions grace o malley herself bessie millie janet forsyth christian robertson eliza fraser isobel gunn betty mouat freydis eiriksdottir skipper thuridur trouser beret alfhild the herring lassies and numerous mythological characters to whet my appetite but then fails to deliver a full satisfying portrait of any of them she raises more questions than she answers and i d need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information you may also notice given the names that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who though from europe sailed the caribbean as for sjoholm s writing style the book is an easy read but not a very enjoyable one sjoholm s writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors for example the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates walnuts and chocolate chips in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola \( pg 222 \) flowery gratuitous and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin you might say it s not the worst book i ve ever read but i do wish i d spent my money on something else it doesn t deliver what it promises and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead,negative
i started reading this book hoping for the best in turn i found that my hopes weren t fulfilled the beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more after the tone changed the book became bitter and boring the characters lost their flare and the whole book lost personality the book became dull and lost appeal to me the book s writing style in the beginning was original and fun following the death of little red the book slowly fell apart leaving me tempted to stop reading the book if someone asked me to recommend a good book this would not be the one,negative

this book covers all the elements of game theory emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism the philosophical aspects are also given a thorough treatment the 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition of several key concepts such as the minmax theorem the geometry of equilibria and linear programming the book has not changed much since its publication in 1957 but it is by no means archaic even for those who have a modern and more rigorous textbook games and decisions is highly recommended as a supplement there is something for everyone in it,positive

when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop i decided at once that i needed to own it it s large it s bulky but it s beautiful it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom s works as an artist myself who learnt a lot from tom s unique techniques i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art both colour and black and white has been compiled into this collection but it s not just pictures there s an insight into the man himself a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists like myself waiting for recognition,positive
this is one of the worst written programming books i have seen yet i m sorry i bought it it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance and dangerously little about c programming duffy s review correctly describes the main flaws i would add that \( 1 \) the book is not structured to build upon oo gof patterns or stl design principles \( 2 \) the code does not follow even basic c coding conventions \( 3 \) the images \( screenshots \) are agonizingly unreadable \( 4 \) the code listings are in italics using a variable pitch font is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a 100 book \( 5 \) no over arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers for example pg 19 data types section int holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million for example int i 2000000 long same as int wrong professor this is not only a syntactically incorrect example but a just plain wrong assertion if the reader does not know how to determine the \( platform specific \) size of an int or long then the author has only served to confuse the matter further furthermore i consider it a cheapskate tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form \( particularly when the book s code listings are so sloppy \) that said i would not use the code even if it had been supplied for free but it might have been interesting to have something to play around with have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate advanced fin techs who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations \( futures forwards etc \) but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code,negative
this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries in between the entertainment biz cliches the author can only think to put various assination hits some of the characters are interesting but not believable and they certainly can t make up for the braindead plot read some of his other novels and skip this one,negative

if you like math i guarantee you ll like this book the author starts out with some very nice infinite sums from 17th and 18th century mathematics \( newton leibniz the bernoullis and euler s gamma function \) he continues into the 19th century with riemann and lebesque integrals weierstrass pathological functions cantor s set theory and winds up with baire s category theorem reading this book is like taking a guided tour through real analysis \( calculus of one real variable \) with the math prof you always wished you had its only prerequisite is a working knowledge of calculus the main points are explained very clearly so the reader can skip through the book or fill in the details and will learn a lot either way the book is very well written and a great pleasure to read i highly recommend it for students fans and teachers,positive
i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one sided book i ve ever read it wasn t about the crimes it was about this author s personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos he has a real problem with women lesbians in particular he made ms wuornos out to be someone she wasn t she had a hard life yes and chose to committ crimes but that wasn t what this book was about again it wasn t worth the i actually threw my copy of this away,negative

i give this book a 4 star rating not because i believe in the necronomicon but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome \( though i doubt it s authenticity per se \) it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other and more valid than some dead names has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique wandering bishop phenomena and the so called slavonic orthodox church overall both an informative and entertaining volume whether you believe or not,positive

ed klein is really so desperate in his attack that he can t find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against hillary what a lot of misinformation and outright lies to actually accuse marian wright edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal and to insinuate that chelsea was the result of a rape even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant is disgusting i should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were monica lewinsky,negative
as i began to read this book i was reminded of jack dempsey s observation that champions get up when they can t all of us have encountered professional setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially difficult to overcome most of the examples which jeffrey sonnenfeld and andrew ward cite in this book involve ceos who either fired back and eventually prevailed after a career setback \( e g donald trump martha stewart bernie marcus jimmy carter and george foreman \) or never fully recovered from them \( e g jill barad john scully leona helmsley jacques nasser and linda warnaco \) the former demonstrate the importance of seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph which sonnenfeld and ward recommend the latter demonstrate the probable consequences of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a five step strategy for rescuing and restoring a career and reputation after a devastating professional setback is based it would be a disservice to sonnenfeld and ward as well as to those who read this brief commentary if i were to list the lessons and steps which are best revealed within the narrative of this remarkably thoughtful eloquent and practical book each is anchored in a real world context each is relevant to anyone now embarked upon or preparing for a professional career i mention this last point because some who consider purchasing this book may incorrectly assume that its material will be of greatest value only to senior level executives on the contrary all of sonnenfeld and ward s observations and recommendations can be of substantial benefit to anyone who wishes to \( a \) avoid a devastating professional setback or \( b \) recover from one in essence this book provides sonnenfeld and ward s response to this question how can i overcome a professional setback to their credit at no time do they minimize or trivialize the impact of a professional setback \( presumably each has experienced a few of his own \) they fully appreciate the difficulty of overcoming the debilitating psychological stress of failure the challenges of failure to one s reputation \( both personal and professional \) social biases about failure and other challenges which may be unique to one s company its culture and its industry if not tragic or devastating a setback almost always lowers one s self esteem is embarrassing and has adverse financial consequences more often than not there is collateral damage to one s family members and or to one s close colleagues at work so guilt also comes into play recall the dempsey quotation provided earlier presumably sonnenfeld and ward agree with dempsey on the importance of courage and also with me that it is much easier to summon the courage to get up when you are convinced that the situation is not hopeless and that you can indeed recover if you understand what has happened why it has happened and how you can and should respond to it of course it is preferable to avoid a setback in the first place \( if ifs and buts were fruits and nuts \) most of us are not so fortunate and i for one have learned the most important lessons from failures \( mine and others \) rather than from successes whether or not a given failure is our fault it is certainly our responsibility to take full advantage of the learning opportunity it offers and then to make positive and productive use of whatever truth has been revealed it is interesting to examine the lives of great leaders who rebound after career disasters but in my opinion it is imperative to examine with rigor and candor one s own values attitudes and behavior especially when struggling to understand and then recover from a professional setback which is invariably a personal setback also as sonnenfeld and ward make crystal clear this journey of personal discovery is by no means easy nonetheless it is one which must be initiated with commitment and then sustained by persistence throughout one s life if and when setbacks occur and they always do the practical advice which sonnenfeld and ward offer in this book will enable those who absorb and digest it to understand and \( yes \) accept what has happened understand why it has happened and then leverage that wisdom effectively and productively not only in their careers but in their personal lives,positive

this is the worst novel that i have ever read by a major author i have read a couple other alex cross novels and i did not find them to be awful at all they weren t very good but they kept me turning the page while i was reading this dreck i began to get a sense of patterson s work ethic he sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it one maybe two chapters per day i suppose and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result not a snowball s chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren t written by patterson i m done don t waste your time really,negative

filled with bizarre generalizations and the most pretentious phraseology i ve seen in years this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20 years jodi dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings of culture history politics or even writing style it seems she should have spent more time with turabian s manual for writers than surfing the web or watching sienfeld,negative
i can t give this book more than two stars and that s being generous mr hall does present some interesting ideas but unfortunately his editors have done him a huge disservice here are the first three sentences of stage i on page 23 essentially what we have now nanoscale science and technology including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes and a very limited ability to manipulate that is by pushing things around with the same scanning probes a scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick because you have a computer behind it you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture i made it through the first fifty pages and it didn t get any better i don t know if mr hall had a final read before publication or not but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited,negative
i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations in chapter 5 he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly he says the value of c \( t \) must be infinite or nonzero but doesnt bother to show why this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions its not all bad but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it i have read good textbooks this isnt one of them,negative
this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett s five novels which he wrote between 1929 and 1934 a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks low lives and the seedier side of life into hard boiled hard hitting detective stories this was a time when urban corruption was the rule and private detectives journalists and police officers shared information two of these novels the maltese falcon and the glass key are american classics another the thin man inspired one of hollywood s best loved movie franchises hammett s novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place laying bare violence corruption and pervasive cynicism but they re not dreary the sharp prose crackles and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it steadfast in their own codes of conduct their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels the thin man appeared first in redbook the others in black mask the maltese falcon \( 1930 \) and the glass key \( 1931 \) are flawless the maltese falcon features private detective sam spade a irresistible femme fatale and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette the last pages of the book are some of the most hard hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction and they re brilliant the glass key explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city oddly the detective is the right hand man of a crime boss red harvest \( 1929 \) features the adventures of hammett s most popular detective the continental op in a town called personville or poisonville to those who know it better the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare the novel s opening paragraph deserves to be read several times the thin man \( 1934 \) is an attempt at humor among new york s blue blooded cold blooded upper crust hard boiled humor is interesting in concept but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny and hammett s style was in decline at this point at least his characteristic cynicism wasn t the dain curse \( 1929 \) is another continental op novel this one is melodramatic absurd and not up to hammett s usual standards hammett fans shouldn t miss it but others may find it pointless i described the novels in order of descending quality complete novels organizes them chronologically five novels is a lot to pack into one book but complete novels doesn t resemble a door stop it s a handy size actually the print is not too small but the pages are quite thin editor stanley marcus a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett s work has included a chronology of hammett s life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett s life the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels which are useful the notes also contain an introduction to the maltese falcon written by hammett in 1934 in which he explains the origins of that novel s characters it s quite interesting for those who prefer to own these novels separately vintage crime black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions but if you want hardback and don t mind all five novels in one volume this is quite a nice book,positive

first published in 1936 this is the 12th poirot book the 3rd superintendent battle book and the 2nd colonel race book and has no narrator it s the first case in which superintendent battle mrs oliver or col race appear together with poirot or each other and the only case in which all do so at once the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes where poirot encounters mr shaitana a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case but it becomes clear that he s a victim waiting to happen for shaitana like a few other collectors in christie s universe has succumbed to a foolish temptation and begun collecting people and not just people of talent or genius but murderers and being a connoisseur he collects only the best those who have gotten away with it he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby without naming names and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of tigers \( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger but would do so from outside the tiger s cage having respect for the danger \) poirot accepts the supper invitation however to find that there are seven other guests including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers explorer major despard a strong silent type mrs lorrimer a middle aged widow who is very serious about bridge timid young anne meredith and dr roberts a loud and jovial general practitioner shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder but otherwise the subject does not come up and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper arising from the final game to find their host dead stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players this is of course poirot s fantasy case as he once remarked in the abc murders because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another there are only the people themselves and their memories of the evening and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they d committed and gotten away with rather than following poirot s viewpoint in third person throughout some chapters follow battle race or mrs oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case each represents a different style battle is a professional police officer race an empire builder type secret agent and mrs oliver a writer of detective stories battle of course has a duty to investigate shaitana s murder and does so in an orthodox style cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him race deals with checking out major despard the explorer who s most clearly his kind of person mrs oliver for her part works on worming information out of not only anne meredith but her roommate rhonda \( whose attitude is that anne could ve lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she d been paying attention \) and of course there s poirot he s really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn pursuing two major lines of questioning \( 1 \) describe how the bridge games played out and \( 2 \) describe the scene of the murder \( the elaborate collector s room in shaitana s house where the bridge games were played \) see if you can figure out where poirot s questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues and what he learned from the responses he received,positive
i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i d admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals,negative

although i m not new to wwii histories the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne s the price of glory since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi s most epic battles i did not hesitate to read stalingrad the fateful siege by antony beevor in both works comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander s control and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down from the well documented cold lice and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov s trap it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor s work makes the reader sympathize for russians germans romanians and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers he also examines the more famous players in the battle including a paranoid stalin a dreaming hitler a finger pointing von manstein and a indecisive paulus indeed the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad overall stalingrad the fateful siege is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard hitting military history,positive

this book is very revealing to the reader of the special aspect of being a christian which is being a dispenser as well as a receiver of grace so much of the christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite we see more often the christian faith portrayed as a religious form political arm and unloving attitude this book is a real insight into the christian faith of how to be a true follower of christ who cared so much about individuals especially those who were not self righteous but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives,positive
david fromkin s peace to end all peace is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east \( extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia \) was created during and after the first world war obviously in order to do this the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered this is where fromkin s unusual methodology comes into play focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the eastern question in their favour the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process admittedly it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire \( and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter \) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations the problem that fromkin has however is that he does not make these very well at all the story is told in a roughly chronological manner which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters ultimately the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is additionally fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well shown on the maps provided indeed one map \( showing enver pasha s advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia \) is laughable in the extreme the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows and not equilateral triagles where fromkin does well however is in his use of purely european sources it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question in terms of europe however his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did ultimately a peace to end all peace is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been \( the chapters in margaret attwood s the peacemakers or william cleveland s modern middle east both easily outshine this \),negative
the author makes a couple of valuable points first any long term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent secular \( i e indefinitely long \) bear markets most leading investment advisors recommend a buy and hold strategy but this only works during predominately bull market periods most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982 1999 bull market which is anomalous in historical terms the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that buy and hold doesn t always provide the best returns obviously then it s better to pull out during the bear markets but that s easier said than done the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets including p e ratio interest and inflation rates and gdp the problem is that those characteristics don t always correlate with market performance for example this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market well if you heeded his advice you would have missed the bull market of 2004 2005 and early 2006 especially in small mid caps and foreign stocks even with high p e ratios a bull market can continue for several years witness the late 90s it s virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis there is so much volatility on a daily weekly monthly and yearly basis that s it s impossible to know when the market has switched directions by the time that it is apparent it s too late to profit even in the midst of great bull markets there might be week month or even year long downturns the author says nothing about individual stock picking beyond a general value approach the book is all about big picture long term trends another problem is that the author s predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900 but the market \( and economy \) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s as they say past performance does not predict future returns the investment advice provided here is not useful he suggests a portfolio of hedge funds ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k he also recommends a bond ladder an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations i don t need to spend 25 and five hours reading to learn that one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for most studies just average the returns across years but that doesn t reflect real returns let s say you invest 100k into a stock that returns 35 the first year and 15 the second your average return should be 10 a year right wrong at the end of the first year you have 135k minus 15 the second year leaves you with 115k total equal to 7 a year compounded if you had received 10 a year compounded your final total would be over 121k that s 6k difference in just 2 years and the volatility costs add up the book is very poorly written plodding sooooo boring with tons of repetition just as an example the graph showing the y curve relationship between p e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times,negative

a 600 pages tour of flash mx buttons and menus with just a couple ridiculously elementary tutorials thrown in makes me think of somone who had to write a flash book and has never done anything with it but figure out how the user interface works you won t find anything useful in here that is about creating something with flash as for me i am never gonna buy a book from this author again and i am probably also ditching the whole savvy line as well,negative
i love judith mcnaught s work her historicals are stellar one of kind novels that pull at your heart strings in my opinion all of her historicals are winners some of her contemporary works are fabulous as well perfect and paradise to name a few there are other contemporary flops though \( remember when triumphant heart etc \) every breath you take was such a disappointment the plot character development and writing was not up to par i found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again it was really forced someone mentioned it was amatuerish and i have to agree i think anyone could have written this novel i understand that the book was rushed and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash i love judith but this book was just terrible,negative
i generally like elmore leonard this is the twelfth book of his i ve read ranging from his detroit crime capers to his l a set chili palmer stuff to some of his westerns other than the terrible be cool this is probably my least favorite of his books so far set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 the story follows carlos carl webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u s marshall the story takes place in the dusty midwest mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city as carl faces off with various wanna be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves carl is a somewhat vain cocky lawman with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man a no account young man who has everything he needs but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl s path mixed into this are kinds of period details from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to true detective writers to striking miners to mentions of various real life bank robbers pretty boy floyd john dillinger and bonnie and clyde barrow despite all this background detail the story itself failed to engage me there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard s best work there s a good guy a bad guy and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic in fact about halfway through the book i realized that the real story wasn t going to kick in i was in it and unlike many leonard books the supporting cast of characters isn t particularly memorable even leonard s trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech ultimately one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period and perhaps didn t spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story that said the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story given the time and place all in all unless you re really really into the whole 30s gangster thing not worth the time,negative
as other reviewers have stated ludlum passed away at the time of the publication of this novel unfortunately we may never know what other voice has been mingled with ludlum s to complete this tale honestly speaking i believe this to be the case because the story is actually better than i have come to expect from ludlum no disrespect intended but i feel this work is actually above his standard there is certainly a few moments of unbelievable plotting and characterization but who cares when the ride is such a rip at first you think you re reading a typical espionage thriller and eventually come to realize it s more than that much more for new world order conspiracy fans you re in for a treat ludlum et al s take on an old plot is so fresh and intrigueing you are left speechless i ll just say this if you have ever wondered if the nazi s survived wwii you will really wonder after reading the sigma protocol god help us if there s any truth to this plot,positive

after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory this sequel was an absolute let down the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie s \( formerly wonka s \) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth while beyond the reaches of earth s atmosphere our heroes charlie grandpa joe and mr wonka must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids \( pronounced k nids \) aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes far worse than these beasties though are the insufferable old folks whose twenty year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless charlie joe and wonka with no help from charlie s folks or other grandparents save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills returning them to infancy or beyond charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters at the end of the novel the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president in short these three are the most tedious spiteful unredeemable characters i ve come across in children s literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa loompas as i read this book as it is they \( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory \) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore rather than a joy to read,negative
the four tales in this collection are beautifully composed they are art not just stories each story is deep in its unique complexities each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader s mind and when i look back upon the book as a whole upon the adventurous stories the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely i can t help but be extremely impressed,positive
it seems as if it is impossible for a s byatt to write a bad or even a mediocre story after this novel she is one of my new absolute favorites and i have vowed to read everything this amazing author has written i began to read the virgin in the garden and could not put it down i was enraptured by the beautiful descriptions of the two contrasting elizabethian ages and the characters frederica has to be one of the most despicable and yet intriguing literary characters in years my breath was also taken away by the story of marcus potter a haunting amazing character that will stay with you for days the way byatt writes she transports you to 1950s england and the lives of the potters i felt as if i knew these characters like family and could almost sit down to lunch with them by the end of the book her style timing and subtle metaphors of passion and life are irresistible and amazing this is truly a writer who will stand the test of time to become an icon in the likes of the brontes jane austen and kate chopin i cannot wait to share this book with everyone i know highly highly reccomended go to the bookstore or your local library ignore the new glossy bestsellers that try and cheat you out of your money and instead pick up this gorgeous powerful read that new authors cannot hold a candle to,positive
this book is more of an advertisement for scoblete s other books his writing buddies other books and his golden touch craps siminar this book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control which is the reason i bought this book the book is rather a collection of stories scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps it would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up especially the captain the authors ultimate craps hero i couldn t even finish this book it was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through and left the reader with no knowledge gained if you are interested in a good casino book i recomend something by avery cardoza or a book published by his company,negative
here s a good litmus test to show how good a book like breathing lessons is nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret there are no car chases explosions sex scenes \( barely even any kissing \) or exotic locations no one changes or has an epiphany almost nothing happens maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter in law but nothing changes at all to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull heck if someone told me the plot of this book i d think it was really dull too but i didn t want to put it down the reason is that maggie and ira are so well drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira that s how real they seemed to me i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they don t seem like characters acting their parts they seem like real people because of this even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days in all honesty what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i ve ever read about how to write a book this is purely a character driven novel with very little plot except for the death of maggie s friend s husband that gets the ball rolling everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie s personality more than any artificially generated plot twists it s hard for me to find any real faults with this book except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long some people may call this boring or dull but i would call it purely exceptional i loved this book and highly recommend it,positive

shakespeare s life is frustratingly beyond our sight aside from the plays \( which in many cases come down to us in different versions \) we have a slim scattering of legal documents marriage and birth records and vague secondary accounts as the world s preeminent shakespeare scholar greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and with a healthy dose of conjecture arrive at something resembling a biography of the world s greatest dramatist more than that though this work is a biography of the age in which shakespeare lived and wrote elizabethan and jacobian london and how the major events of this time affected shakespeare s plays for example the writing of king lear may have been encouraged by a trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and estate while the youngest daughter \( named cordell \) tried to stop them a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the bard s greatest tragedy what impressed me the most about this biography is how ordinary shakespeare seemingly was he didn t seem pretentious or snobbish as some people envision him he was born to a humble family and lived frugally despite dying a rather wealthy man although greenblatt s writing is clear and accessible he makes the assumption that you have already read shakespeare s plays or at least are very familiar with them i have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when he discussed plays i hadn t read so if you haven t read more than say ten of his plays the major ones you need to crack open the norton shakespeare \( of which greenblatt is the editor in chief \) before you approach will in the world,positive

i read this book several months ago and i still can t shake the feeling of having read a very very good book the effect of yourcenar s words still lingers the text is an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor hadrian to his successor the emperor himself is dying and faces a world that he is about to leave behind he recalls his life from being a young boy in his native spain to his ascension to the highest public post imaginable that of emperor of rome just as his professional career was incredible so is the generosity and candidness of his confession there is seemingly no secret nook left untouched from his personal life in the end having cast that final weight his conscience from off his shoulders the emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face another that of the gods,positive

updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development as other have stated you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab a truck and a bomb the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else perhaps excellent writing interesting character development or original insights updike fails to deliver on all three counts one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad when ahmad speaks it is in the voice of an intelligent thoughtful foreigner his phrasing captures very well the cadence vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non native speaker of english curiously ahmad is an american raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother so what influences created this stilted phrasing updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character s life is grating updike also relies heavily on ethnic religious stereotypes sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature however in updike s case the stereotypes make little sense at all for instance a high school counselor s entire personality is attributed to his jewishness both by himself and by others who opine on his personality this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and in fact his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier so where does all the jewsih influence come from likewise ahmad s mother s personality is often linked to her irish heritage yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background \( which could have been many generations ago \) has influenced her one bit the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype other than simply poor writing and careless character development another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic obviously few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script after all the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind ultimately the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author,negative

i grew up reading harold evan s sunday times in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome \( i m irish \) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland however from today s perspective the paper s foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as what would the world do without henry kissinger indeed this has always seemed to be mr kissinger s view also and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles \( ss 20s \) being deployed in russian forests i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions supported by diagrams of saddam s mobile chemical biological weapons labs which turned out not to exist in saying all the above i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch the book has three sections the first describes some of the episodes which made evan s sunday times great the investigative reports from the insight team and others of malicious cover ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry \( thalidomide \) and the aircraft industry \( mcdonnell douglas \) the publication of the crossman diaries laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet having established his credentials as a vertical journalist evan s term which he describes as seeking to get to the bottom of things and lauding his proprietors the thomson s for allowing him to do so the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr murdoch as owner the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating the thomson s were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of national directors guarantees which if breached were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times one of the free worlds most revered titles in his description of the paper evans reveals an almost po faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment he sees it as the paper of record upholding fair non partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people s educational background almost every colleague is named and then his her school and university are listed for example joe smith winchester oxford to establish both social class and academic \( perhaps intellectual \) credentials he documents the four pillars of the times as its reporting of parliament its legal coverage its obituaries and its leader columns oh dear stolid stuff from the fearless vertical investigative editor nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan s new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which by implication criticise his predecessor as editor \( william rees mogg \) and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution looming behind this story is murdoch s general management style haphazard interventions secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors the text here is well paced and descriptive the tension plays havoc with everyone save perhaps murdoch evan s second in command betrays him various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys the national directors turn out to be paper tigers \( this is too good a pun to delete \) the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken piecemeal the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious double dealing murdoch whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval however by the time i got to this section i had sadly lost a lot of respect for evan s impartiality his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities this was reaffirmed in my mind when on the day that evan s agreed to reign who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor initially at least popular evans though personally engaging and i m sure mercurial and demanding came to represent a set of fading political beliefs the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union the fading indeed failing social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change the rest of the story evans attractive forthrightness murdoch s furtive acquisitiveness while the human interest focus of the story are ultimately a side show this book is well told highly dramatic and engaging however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was

according to charles kimball religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth religion inspires humans to transcend their self interests while at the same time more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution using a comparative religious approach kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil kimball argues the word religion is amorphous and difficult to define as a result the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions kimball next asks if religion is the cause of evil and he answers both yes and no a religion that is arrogant condescending and requires adherents to disconnect their brain is problematic on the other hand religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine the propensity towards evil increases dramatically sacred texts sources of wisdom and guidance become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims christianity and islam have missionary mandates but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims kimball argues for a human view of truth one that is dynamic and relational allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities when a charismatic leader demands total obedience has unrestricted power and has total control religion is unhealthy uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection strict segregation from the larger society combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time the likelihood for disaster increases many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god s agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means when one theological component gets elevated thus becoming an end and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end all religions have notions of sacred space but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space reinforcing or protecting group identity against an other or protecting group identity from within the group are also potentially dangerous signs institutional structures develop in all religious traditions but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a holy war kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990 91 islam is a peaceful religion which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order the word jihad means struggling in the way of god but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense with rules similar to the christian just war theory because of socio economic disparities some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis faith hope and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted against secularism kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time tested wisdom and ethical standards and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity with religious diversity christians have three options exclusivism inclusivism and pluralism but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity finally the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab israeli palestinian conflict then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak,positive

sacred pathways is easy to read plain balanced and straightforward the book surveys 9 different spirituality types for each type it identifies scripture historical characters styles of worship and dangers the book contains an evaluation tool to help the reader identify his or her personal spiritual personality as with any survey tool this book does not go deeply enough into any particular spiritual practice it doesn t need to what it offers is an excellent service to the christian community for those who are trapped in a church that worships in a style predominately different from the their own this book offers the knowledge that the reader is not alone there are others out there that worship in the same way for those who believe that all true worship looks like their style of worship this book offers a broader view of the christian landscape i gave this book 5 stars because it could have a potentially life changing impact on those who have lived in a closed environment,positive

though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs at one point the author actually defends episiotomies she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth it was both infuriating and saddening if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little this is cute if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth this is not for you,negative

i have written software for development projects for 30 years and i have managed several projects martin fowler has extraordinary insight and i enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought i find the main lesson i pick up from this book is break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon refactoring for each of the small projects refactoring works well in some cases i suppose refactoring works well for some people i suppose i m skeptical though fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of refactoring he assures us that refactoring may overload small projects with methodology making it unsuitable for them and it works really well for larger projects i suspect however that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise if i m to risk this methodology on a large project i want to see it perform well on a smaller project first fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples in the case of refactoring the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility,negative
i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women men are to rule and women are to submit to that rule the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read discovering biblical equality it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women,negative

when john grisham introduced us to bendini lambert locke a memphis tax boutique controlled by the mafia the idea of an in house firm for the mob was hilarious these days no one least of all our hero scott finn is particularly sure that organized crime doesn t just control the firm but also the governor s office the us attorneys office and the boston pd finn who worked and fought his way out of the streets of southie to the thick pile carpets of boston s brahmin legal establishment finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind when a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate little jack who was terrorizing the city finn is drawn into the fray where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying though not very hard to put him away and a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process if it seems over the top it is but it is good fun too,positive

when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept i resolved that i would alert other readers generally i enjoy this author s works and anticipated this latest tome i was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it s clues or probable developments everything was telegraphed and nothing was original the conclusion was so lame that i was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue my advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next,negative
i enjoyed this book for the most part i feel the trip throught the stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the mountain the main characters were all there participating in the problem solving there was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode and some food for thought added in as well is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there i don t know but this book presents some interesting questions i await the next book in the series,positive

this is by far my favorite novel by forster and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels period in his first book forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i at least feel that he lost as he got more self consciously philosophical in later books like howard s end and a passage to india he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art bringing them to vivid life undermining tourist cliches and weaving them gracefully into his main themes no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly,positive
i have a hard time understanding what it is that i dislike about the novel i dislike it almost as much as the movie i have been a loyal follower of smiley and some more after that once the cold war was over jlc had to look for a new realm i tried to follow him but gave up with the kaukasian troubles forgot the name of the book maybe it is this jlc s trade mark his usp is the evilness of the other side with the kgb co that worked perfectly his readers were willing to stay with him and believe him now he is transferring the kgb style to all sorts of other badies i think it does not work any more it is not that i trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated i do not what i do not like i guess is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies tess in this story seems to be the normal do gooder who falls foul with the baddies that is more ok in the book than in the movie \( there for my eyes rachel weisz does herself discredit \) what is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way jlc gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations,negative
zadie smith is one of the most powerful authors i have read in recent times she is so subtle about the race factor that we don t get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so she has also captured the emotions of kiki and zora perfectly \( why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments \) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down if you enjoyed the movie crash you will love this one,positive
the author of this book warren wagar is apparently a professor of future studies i certainly hope he has long been fired from that post a short history of the future was written in 1989 but the writer is so ignorant of politics and so wrong to be blunt it reads as if it was written in the 1940 s orwell s 1984 is more on the mark than this he shows barely any creativity in his predictions and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time the fact that he assumes the soviet union will continue plodding along well into the 21st century is incredibly naive the fact that he assumes the nation s socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre did he read the newspapers did he pay any attention to that gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing russia down and honestly did anyone really expect that germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal or that latin america and africa would remain dictatorships forever or that black rule in south africa would not occur until 2014 if this book had been written 30 or 40 ago it would be excusable this book is just sloppy he doesn t even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations like and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose that sort of thing the author is clearly an ivory tower academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague trends the fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future,negative

i ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who s who of public school using this format nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a christian book espousing christian dogma and assumptions i m surprised this is acceptable for use by government funded public schools furthermore there is a lot of non scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition i m very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising some of the parenting tips are common sense that i didn t think needed to be reiterated a person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down i was looking for more than that the advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process there is false logic in some of the parental mistakes an example is always attributing hovering parents to ego issues that a parent needs to be needed some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can t see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger false assumptions leads to false conclusions i gave this 2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book at least could adopt some common sense but it isn t helping my family,negative
malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books he almost makes the process seem easy and maybe it is if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant however much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a plateau ed or downward spiraling church that has been around for 100 years the principles are easy and make sense if you have 100 support of the congregation that s pretty hard to do in most of the churches i ve been in that need strategic planning the most that s no fault of malphurs the book itself is a great book,positive
college stoner cult following aside hunter s thompson s journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say the average wwe heavyweight title match for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide eyed optimism of the 60s but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor s press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting four more years was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while how does the cliche go the more things change the more they stay the same after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern s presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice presidential nominee thomas eagleton just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern s running mate two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press mcgovern s presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover since then we ve seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic mascot will be for the 2008 race perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap but i digress i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book like presidential campaigns themselves can at times seem uneventful thompson addresses this from time to time wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long needed fix other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics for instance hst s extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates reads like hieroglyphics to me,positive
i was quite disappointed by this book i was expecting something with more professional level content it s all very amateur however the artwork used in the examples is sub professional at best i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre press issues relating to comics artwork but the chapter there was frustratingly slight you would be much better to buy a a more general pre press book the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much,negative

i ve been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting well he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting if not spectacular non fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row i won t go into the details of williamson s ordeal but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut and dried book that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers but is still interesting nonetheless he does a good job giving the details of ron s case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues grisham didn t even think about writing ron s story until after ron passed away so there are no interviews to draw upon but he does a decent job of tying it all together i will also say that although he is anti death penalty he doesn t hammer that opinion at you he lets the story itself do the talking i m actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham s next novel as he ll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like the firm or a time to kill not dreck like the king of torts,positive

when i discovered the existence of this novel i was enthusiastic and intrigued unfortunately my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages kleopatra focuses on the famous queen s early years a period of time of which we have no record and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family \( something she may have compensated for in adulthood \) what i liked 1 \) the spelling of kleopatra cleopatra with a k it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection 2 \) kleopatra s strength of character essex s general characterization is appropriate and it s easy to see what kleopatra will become although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex it just didn t work for me the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far fetched and although i loved kleopatra s love interest \( i won t give away his name \) i felt it was a bit far fetched as well almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something kleopatra s dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe as was mohama there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit unnecessary overall although kleopatra was a strong believable character she was in the minority the novel as a sort of back story to the queen of egypt didn t work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction at least the sequel is better for fiction that works check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george,negative

this book is terribly organized i m not sure what happened in writing this book but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts people events are repeatedly referred to and then only later does jones bother to define them \( i would almost prefer that he not define something at all rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it \) the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me clearly the author publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate first reference to the concept examples are numerous but here are a few robe nobility referenced on pages 139 152 183 defined \( pg 183 \) sans culottes first referenced on page 189 defined on page 231 louis sebastien mercier referenced on pages 11 138 178 189 200 204 212 213 when did jones provide information \( that he was a journalist dramatist and observer of parisian mores \) on just who mercier is page 215 aside from that there are some plain old errors one such is in the text box on saint genevieve jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s she died in 512ad so the negotiations seem improbable \( 470s 480s would be correct but i should not have to figure that out \) the redeeming quality of the book is that if does offer information on paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances and paris is not such a bad subject,negative

the opening of the mauritius command brings us some changes especially for captain jack aubrey who finds himself in the improbable role \( for him \) of husband and father of twins unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life he immediately jumps at the chance to leave england and take over a new command off the coast of africa jack is promoted to commodore putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet in the course of the book jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the british vie with the french for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the india trade of course dr stephen maturin is on hand too his facets as doctor naturalist and spy all come into play in the course of the novel the previous novel h m s surprise involved incredible physical suffering loss and rejection for stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment however stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him a dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books the overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them the other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule the weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters in spite of the battles and some serious turns of event the mauritius command involves more action and comedy and less angst than h m s surprise making it a lighter read,positive
the snow goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read set on the coast of england at the time of dunkirk it is less about the strife of wwii itself than about its three main characters one of whom is the snow goose and what binds them it is a story about nature love and nobility of spirit to say more would be to give too much away but it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades and i reread it when i need to be reminded what is important in life,positive

surely there s more to chinese youth culture than descriptions of affairs with tall western men being a fan of pearl buck s books on china i was looking for more contemporary accounts of chinese culture but this book was so dissapointing a goodlooking shangaiese woman gives vacuous details of her affair with a tall german man while her doped impotent chinese boyfriend simple wastes away \( why was he even in the story \) the writing is totaly lacking in any kind of talent i was willing to assume her glow was due to her romance than her shiseido face cream need i say more if you want to read an account of a totally self absorbed woman infatuted with caucasian men indulging in meaningless affairs which probably boosts her self esteem read this but there s nothing worthy about china or chinese culture in this,negative

man oh man i think this is one of the worst books i ve ever read if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars i would seriously half way through i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive i found the book bizarre unfocused and poorly written the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation the physics engineering psychology medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome only to have them dissipate and so on the characters don t even seem like real people for example the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles and only her ankles flashing below a curtain and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are how could someone know a person that well but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood or one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive as though he really thinks this will attract them c mon if the guys a nut \( and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking duck to them is nuts \) write him as a nut the whole way through don t make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book s climax the book s title isn t even explained for crying out loud thanatos means death in greek i believe but i could never understand what the author editors audience thought was dying i won t read this one again nor will i look for anything else by percy walker,negative
what this is an epic adventure it would be imappropriate to review the wot series when speaking of the prophesies of the dragon book it s also not really a supplement akin to say the monster manual for d d the only extra skills feats backgrounds etc are those directly related to npcs in the campaign what prophecies is designed to do is take a party of characters through their first six levels of adventuring which correspond roughly to the first six books of the series of novels the players are allowed to play a key behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have been scripted for many of the book s key characters it s a really ambitious undertaking players have to be given a compelling storyline feel like they re making a difference in a campaign that covers over a year of game time without letting them change what happens in the novels does it work i am currently gming this adventure on paper it looks really good some of the scenes especially in the later parts of the story look exciting moving even faile s cameo is perfect for example in practice though it s been an extremely frustrating experience first the early encounters \( as pointed out by another reviewer \) are unnecessarily difficult and add nothing to the plot as things progress the authors presume too much on the goals and motivations of the players there is one chapter for example where the introduction says something along the lines of upon entering the city the players will want to find \( a certain npc \) as soon as posible and will definitely want to investigate the actions of \( another npc \) the players in my campaign knew they wanted to talk to one of these guys eventually but the other one was off their radar completely throughout i ve had to improvise ways to keep them approximating the plot line of the campaign and by chapter 3 they re feeling very manipulated the campaign assumes the party wants to do nothing more than hunt down dark friends and expose evil plots and will take great personal risk and go through great hardship \( including at one point a monthlong trek through a winter wilderness without adequate provisions \) on the chance of thwarting same characters with any other motivations \( say a character modeled after mat or nynaeve in the books \) will feel forced into situations unnaturally there has been more than one point where one of the players saying i think this is where the plot wants us to go so in conclusion while this adventure is excellent in its dreams and scope and it s definitely better than something i could have designed myself but it will fail often fail as a game if you are intending to run a wot campaign buy this adventure read it so that you thoroughly understand its scope before you even let your players make up characters the characters need to be created to fit the story or the story won t work,negative

this book is poorly written and even more poorly edited the back cover states every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out it is a great statement but it is unfortunately not true page 6 so what formats can a script be saved as there are three main kinds of script files regular compiled script which is the native applescript file format and scripts saved as plain text or as applications on top of that os x added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called bundle bundles are folders that appear and behave as files you can read about them in chapter 23 i guess bundle is not a main format why is there a distinction between main formats and for lack of a better term minor formats i have no idea page 35 every class has a super class page 40 we saw that objects belong to classes and classes may have subclasses and super classes which sentence is correct page 43 when you work with an application that doesn t support the whose clause you have to settle for slower clumsier repeat loops repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book there is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in chapter 11 pages 321 343 i wanted to like this book but i do not i look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book because it does have potential to be great however the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing,negative

there are two different types of larkin poem the first type mostly written before 1955 are influenced by yeats and auden and are mediocre the second written when he found his voice are amongst the most wonderful works of english literature ever written so what was his voice basically that of twentieth century man atheistic obsessed with sex regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties he takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems but here s the really incredible thing he uses ordinary uncomplicated language no tricks no arcane allusions just plain english it can t be denied that the voice is bleak and it is too uncompromising for some however those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives,positive

mr dennett s book demonstrates the ignorance irrationality and dishonesty of humanists discussing the meaning of word materialsim professor dennett says in its scientific or philosophical sense it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial like a cartesian soul or ectoplasm or god the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance matter and whatever minds are supposedly made of \( p 302 \) philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism it is naturalism materialism is the view that all that exists is matter materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena \( in a quote below you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in \) it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist but he is certainly a naturalist concerning the proof of god s existence he trots out david hume s who made god which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof let s look at two quotes the first is at the end of the chapter belief in belief and the other at the beginning of the chapter morality and religion that is isn t it true that whether or not god exists religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy in the rule of law in free will the very widespread \( but far from universal \) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning \( p 245 \) without the divine carrot and stick goes this reasoning people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires beak their promises cheat on their spouses neglect their duties and so on there are two well known problems with this reasoning \( 1 \) it doesn t seem to be true which is good news since \( 2 \) is is such a demeaning view of human nature \( p 279 \) in the first chapter he mentions bulwark of morality and meaning but in the second chapter he leaves out meaning if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven what is our purpose is life whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief mr dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians there are worse things than divorcing your spouse disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said mr dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life the only miracle mentioned in mr dennett s book is the shroud of turin which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man since no one claims to know how the image got there it can be called a miracle however mr dennett does not tell us anything about it the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet,negative

the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends they are in fact historical fiction at its best whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy but to weave the stories into historic events the first six novels in the series \( that is all i have read though it appears that there are two or three more \) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend but the beauty of the books is in whyte s prose a scottish poet he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours these books will not insult your intelligence and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend,positive

i read a review of this in l a weekly which said that it was a lot of fun and entertaining in a sort of ironic way despite the fact that it became more slapstick at the end i read it and agreed for the most part except i felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier than i had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than i would have thought from the initial satirical tone the ending was a little over the top but it was an example of the kind of senseless fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives all in all i thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel,positive

the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she s such a boring character she s young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she doesn t enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job \( which she doesn t seem to enjoy \) was just a boring digression,negative
there is no doubt that antonia fraser s the journey is written in the author s usual wry witty and highly engaging style \( although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as lugubrious \) there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marie antoinette s shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable however i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions for one thing why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage what about sophie of anhalt zerbst \( catherine the great \) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land this sort of thing happened all the time it was what being a princess was all about i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi s impotence phimosis and surgery and all that she simplistically portrays him as being asexual which was not true because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed it but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion i must say it is a first fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character but i guess fraser does oh well it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy if the queen had had her way her descendant would be reigning today and that is just the reality of it for a better study of marie antoinette s relationship with her husband i would recommend vincent cronin s louis and antoinette as for better biographies of the queen let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english,negative

great book it get s you thinking my kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all i could ask for yes i worked but not until they were in school almost always part time and i did not use working as an excuse to not volunteer at school sports and generally be in my kids lives the point is really about your priorities do you instinctively put your kids needs first it s been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area we have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten now they are seniors you can instantly tell which parents were connected involved and had their priorities straight not all of them stayed home the whole time on and off i used to listen to dr laura frequently agreeing but many times not what i love is that she has an unpopular point of view and she s not going to let social financial or industry pressure dilute her message yes she s frequently abrasive so were many people who have made an impact in the course of events in this world if you are a parent with young children read the book at least it will give you important ideas to agree or disagree with,positive
leonaur ltd is publishing the definitive edgar rice burroughs 21st century editions these usually contain 2 books of the different erb major series in order thus far john carter pellucidar and carson of venus in the future possibly tarzan these books are handsome and my rating is mainly based on this the erb fan knows best about the rest of it this first volume of joh carter of mars contains 2 3 of the greatest science fiction fantasy trilogy ever what is nore remarkable is that these were published over 40 years before tolkien s lotr and over 50 before tolkien became fashionable a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars are erb s greatest work it is sad in a way that tarzan obscures erbs mars novels for the general public these books deserve to be beter known and it is astonishing no movie or tv adaptation has ever been attempted \( which might be a good thing after all \) if only steven spielberg or peter jackson were interested of course genre and erb aficionados have long know and cherised these great stories i wonder how many others were first attracted to these by the magnificent ballantine editions of the 1960s if you are a fan as am i support leonaur ltd s efforts by buying these magnificent books,positive
this book is for the diehard dave navarro fans only the only reason i gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative the text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist neil straus approached writing the dirt with motley crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested this book falls short unless i would have been inclined to want to see things dave s way i grew restless of this pretty quickly,negative

i was barely able to finish this book armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches etc by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of this made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously i might have been able to swallow the idea of cabals \( giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors it s unclear why they don t just take over the world and have done \) but armstrong really lost me during the 20 page extended send up of anne rice s vampires this genre is rapidly sinking into self referentialism and armstrong is the worst culprit in industrial magic she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is on top of that the viewpoint character paige is unfortunately named she s as flat and boring as the pages she s written on her central relationship is with her boyfriend lucas but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors are we supposed to think this is cute and funny take home project for armstrong next time try putting some genuine emotion into your work,negative
this book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security global warming etc as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells the author contributes little to previous books on the subject such as rikin s book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public if anything the book s original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms in doing so the author comes up with some interesting case studies but it s quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of the economist which happens to be the author s employer moreover there was little effort in integrating the various chapters overall a very disapointing book the author should stick to journalism,negative

i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican funny he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement and let s face it he stink bombed george h w bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton i m not saying bush would have won if walsh hadn t indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election but walsh made a next to impossible task unattainable for bush bush got him back of course by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve 1992 the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least as it wore on however it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans let s face it people in power tend to be corrupt they have protection the rest of us don t have this wasn t just true about reagan and bush it s true about clinton and whoever you wish to name about halfway through the book walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time ghw bush i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least i guess when you can t beat a guy at the ballot box you impeach him or at least try to right not worth the investment of time or money but does have some good historical information inside,negative
i have loved many of jodi picoult s other books but this one seemed too far fetched i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in fact detracted from it many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release,negative
many reviewers compared this novel to jurassic park saying it was a better book than crichton s what absurdity i am not saying that jp is an awesome book but it was far better than tyrannosaur canyon tyrannosaur canyon is a fairly intriguing story but poorly executed and very poorly ended it s as though preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in and didn t know how to do it the ending is too fast too unlikely and too unrealistic the book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters which i believe is preston s way of attempting to belong to both camps having his science and being religious overall i had high hopes for this book and i am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages i was greatly let down,negative

i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum s book the sigma protocol it says in ludlum s latest an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy well gee that s the plot of this book as well come to think of it that s the plot of every book by the man that i ve read a vast right wing conspiracy is set to take over the world they have small armies a lot of money and a plan this time around a group of military men \( naturally \) plan to foment terror and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world \( laugh not millions in the middle east and far left believe 9 11 was something along the same lines \) enter ordinary man joel converse he s a vietnam vet and p o w who thought he had left that life far behind it s up to him to save the world he will survive certain death several times \( the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger \) he will find love and he ll visit several european cities to boot of course a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels \( how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side \) but ludlum s cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn t write his dialogue writing is always tedious and sometimes just painful to read action scenes are generic the only thing he could do right is character background but that s not enough to save this the aquitaine progression might make a half decent tv movie but to endure 700 pages is just too much,negative
i finished it because a friend recommended it but had she not i would have quit after page 20 i wasn t interested in the story or writing i didn t find the story grotesque i ve read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book but i just didn t find the protagonist very interesting he went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation we learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs to redeem himself his actions didn t seem out of line either during the war or during the plague given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences i know this is a great example of a book written in second person and perhaps for that it is worth reading i wouldn t pick it up for enjoyment or leisure,negative

i had to read this book for a political theory class in college after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with the book is also not organized well in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights to be honest i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her still i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories in short i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure or intellectual curiosity if you have to read the rights of others for a class i extend my condolences,negative
good book on deal structure but if you want a valuation number check out unlocking the value of your business,negative
i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d macdonald style just because that s what film going audiences like i do not think this is a bad thing but i like some of the reviewers here are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i e macdonald s cape fear or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof as for her writing style she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown what we re left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents davy his fiancee and to some extent lani who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone challenged the men in this novel just weren t credible when they spoke i kept seeing jance speaking for them so we re left with a high concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker what s the tohono o otham word for 2 thumbs down quot,negative

this is one of the finest popular histories i have ever read whether it is a book about 5th and 6th century british history using arthur as a organizing principle or a book about the real arthur using 5th and 6th century history as a backdrop this book is wholly convincing concerning the reality of arthur and the historical context in which he lived the book may actually be too good the most convincing evidence it cites the so called british easter annals appear to have been called into question by subsequent scholarship and the link between arthur and mount badon is not quite as convicing as it seeme to be when alcock wrote the book in short this masterpiece needs updating but a masterpiece it is no one who reads this book with any care can fail to come away from it without a vastly improved understanding not only of the british dark ages but of the nature of historical evidence scholarship and truth this is a great book,positive
hard to figure why sean stewart isn t one of the most beloved writers in america given the virtuoso performance he s demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic character he s created in will kennedy a combination horror fantasy work which is as reminiscent of a confederacy of dunces as it is ghosts by hynd this novel is filled with so much warmth and life that it s hard to remember that this actually is a story about a man who understands that the past too can be a ghost and perhaps the worst kind perfect circle is everything every other supposed 5 star horror novel featured on amazon is supposed to be well written compelling with rich empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its own it s a wonderful introduction to mr stewart s work,positive
this book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life it combines something of the science the personalities and the history of this field for general readers with some technical sophistication it affords an opportunity to broaden one s horizons without too much of a mathematical stretch for computer scientists who are thinking of their own research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the field and a place to start delving into the original research papers read it and enjoy the future,positive
there s nothing unique about this text all the topics discussions have been well covered in other basic textbooks on corporate finance mergers etc the discussions lack depth the whole concept of corporate strategy has been miscontrued by the authors the link between this and financial markets is very ambiguous blur fyi i m a businessman hold an mba in finance from an international university,negative
this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother s death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is it can never match the perception of others one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice and meursault s response was it was the human justice that put me here no matter what acts you commit whether they be henous incensitive or loving one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change his fate with this i dont even have a chance to survive not even a slim one,positive
unfortunately for all the name brand that this book conveys i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales boggles this readers mind the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book i would be astounded save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation by the way those giving 5 stars either can t read english very well or are shills for mckinsey,negative
first off anyone who gave this book five stars was employed by the publisher to up the rating that simple i mean look at some of them they are so cheesy one of them actually refers to the author as mr miller who is he brown nosing for sounds like a greeting card they are so textbooky and insincere the book itself is almost entirely filler on how to read music \( which half the music books in borders are or they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short \) up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when i asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along the problems with this is everything is assumed in the entire field i recommend the only book that i have found that made some sense to me called fractals in music by charles madden much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning working into more and more complex shapes and structures,negative
the author is a journalist but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right wing think tank like business elites the author basically does not particularly like democracy in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas even authoritarians if needed he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism based on laws rights especially property rights separation of powers with much of that power being held in unelected bodies and most of all free market capitalism he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits most in the west do care rights and legal systems are not neutral the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment though the author s real target is us society he looks at the results of democracy over the world and of course he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn t work a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us in the us the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years in actuality he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism in this era elites in finance business law banking health care various media etc have likewise been swept up in fact are the driving force in a money first culture he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal mart and the like represents democratic empowerment the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal mart juggernaut he especially decries direct citizen actions he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets however he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes it s hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century and their heirs should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums if citizens had actually been democratically empowered such distortions of the political process could have been prevented the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites no rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy not buttressed it if the author put journalism first instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process actually foiling democracy first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system distorting and muting all challenging ideas it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez faire free market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free trade agreements worker visa programs massive immigration out of control energy policies broken health care systems huge cutbacks in various safety net programs massive redistribution of wealth upwards the gutting of our manufacturing base etc the list could go on informed empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy but is in the throes of democratic failure which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book americans are supposedly fiercely democratic yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule even anti democratic generals if need be the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment,negative
i haven t completed the book yet but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable it begins in genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read bible sections to the not so often or seldom read sections he ends everyday with a thought provoking question to think on through out the rest of your day i always look for to the next reading,positive

this book has a lot of information about how protecting wild areas works in wa and and an overview of the protections offered by the united states government it then provides the inspiration to get people started through true stories of grassroots projects while the book doesn t list 1 2 3 what needs to be done to start a grassroots movement that shouldn t be expected because all people have different motivations and this book should be used as a tool to help you understand the basics of how these sorts of movements work a must for anyone who wants to further understand washington state for all of its great wild places or anyone for that matter that is looking for inspiration on why wild areas should be protected plus all of the proceeds go to a great cause,positive
it was just that dry and boring i never really connected with any of the characters i gave up reading about 3 4ths of the way through,negative
this is a very thorough very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states and while it may not be as easily readable as say david mccullough s truman it is certainly less dry and slow going than most scholarly works if you re looking for a full life biography of monroe one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure s life this is an excellent choice if you re looking for light reading with a historical basis this is definitely not what you re looking for,positive
deyoung begins by relating how bush pushed powell out at the end of his 1st term without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him making matters worse was the fact that bush didn t even know why powell was at the white house when it came time to say good bye colin powell came from jamaican parents \( often called jewmaicans by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education \) and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little if any racial prejudice later on unfortunately the insults were quite aggravating but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny \( majored in geology \) however rotc piqued his sophomore year interest and he soon became a standout powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet and top graduate \( or very close \) in every military training setting he undertook as well as a top mba student at george washington university he also was top ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment leading to his being offered a white house fellowship which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs national security advisor and secretary of state one of powell s secrets of success was to enthusiastically implement all orders even those he considered silly powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others unfortunately powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney \( a bit of a problem during gulf war i a serious problem when cheney became v p \) between cheney s far right bias \( out on the looney fringe per powell \) and bush ii s disturbingly disjointed decision making per treasury secretary o neill \) powell s contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded often with don rumsfeld s help in addition he was often left out of important decisions especially when out of the country ultimately powell s credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u n speech attesting to saddam s wmd the big question still debated is why didn t he resign his supporters believe the reason is that powell s nature simply didn t allow anything less than 100 support bottom line if cheney had not been such an ideologue \( telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v p ignoring powell and then sliding into the position himself \) powell would be v p today possibly president in 2008 similarly if bush 41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in 92 powell might well have become first v p and then president,positive
if you want to read a book that s exciting happy and mind blowing you should read small steps from the author that brought you holes louis sachar is at his best this book is sort like a sequel to holes the main character armpit is stuck in a situation which he can not handle he is in the heat in austin texas and i think it is making him do crazy illegal things at first he did not know what he was doing was wrong but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail i think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above both boys and girls would enjoy this book i think they should make a movie out of the book it would get outstanding remarks this is one out of few books that i could read over and over again,positive

what a chore this book was to read if it weren t for my ocd about finishing books that i start i would ve read the first couple of chapters and then given up it seems like a wannabe suspense but it s not it seems like there might be a love story in it but there s not it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it but there is not what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she s going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy she tries to make a connection but falls way short read vinegar hill that one was worth it pass midnight champagne by,negative

first off this book is very entertaining to read unlike many political books it is never tedious or redundant thieves in high places is an accurate portrayal of what is wrong with both parties in america it is also informative and insightful on the roles of big corporations in american politics and local economies this book is a call to arms against large corporations that put locally owned businesses under companies that use child labor overseas and the entire americal political system this book empowers the common man in his fight for an egalitarian society fair wages for all and a real equal oppurtunity at an education i loved this book it was a pleasure to read and confirmed everything that disuades me about america today it is worth a read,positive

lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president this book shows that this is not even close to being true under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle class while giving the rich more money it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency,positive
piglia muestra que es un explorador de nuevas formas narrativas pero la lectura de este libro y de otros suyos nos deja ver a un autor que no se deja leer con facilidad que es cr ptico debe ser leido con mucha atenci n con papel y lapiz en la mano para seguir sus tramas y personajes y eso no es un virtud en un escritor,positive

i assume the plot of this famous tale is well known so i won t spend time on it but in recently re reading this book for the first time since ninth grade english class in the 90 s i was repeatedly struck by a piercing question how exactly over time does drama become melodrama will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred forty years hence how does this happen and is there ever an end point to it dickens was by any standard a literary master and if typifying one s age is a virtue then he does this to perfection yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time \( as other writers have done \) is a limitation then in this one sense alone charles dickens has an achilles heel,positive
i first picked up this book because i ve always been interested in what young writers have to say but i have to admit even i was a little surprised this story mind the mythicism is a real representation of what young children s minds sometimes go through that idea of a person you fabricated gaining more reality than necessary congrats to ms oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about she is one i ll keep in my mind for a while if you like young writers you should check out charles hedji s fields of discovery i m an avid reader once again,positive

pest control is a light hearted book which uses a fast pace and off the wall humor to make up for any depth problems standard story upstart assassin bursts onto the scene creating mayhem in the world of professional killers problem upstart assassin can t even fulfill a contract to rid a restaurant of roaches let alone kill some of the most guarded men in the world the story of bob dillon s flirtation with contract killers is a page turner not really out of suspense because you can t imagine that fitzhugh would subject his characters to anything other than a fairy tale ending but out of unabated curiosity you want to know how in the heck dillon and his cohorts will survive to breed another strain of hybrid bug eating bugs of course fitzhugh answers with simple and hilarious solutions which are towards the end of the book more and more absurd and predictable overall i m slightly embarrassed that i like this book as much as do nonetheless i would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy and humorous read,positive

this very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book it chronicals the life of a young scottish woman forced to live first in china then japan well written and historically accurate it s obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture customs history and life style of japan this makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story for all who ve ever lived in japan it s a believable tale that literally makes you feel you ve stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern japan for those who haven t lived in japan believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind because of this he s able to focus on his character versus scene setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind the timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life a gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her when the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue but even good books must end be prepared to sit a spell once you start reading you ll find it hard to put down,positive
the text gets 5 stars for the orientation organization and the on line resources for the text it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course unfortunately i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make this has been frustrating for my students as well as myself however i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market i strongly recommend a new corrected edition,negative

i read this book 2 years ago and still consider it one of the most compelling and important books i have ever read besides being completely absorbed by this man s life and experiences i learned so much valuable information about cambodia from it that i wish it was required reading for anyone traveling there blended seamlessly with the narrative you will learn of the history and culture of the cambodians the groundwork for the rise of the khmer rouge the horrors and fallacies of life under a communist regime and the story of pol pot i also gained an insight into buddhist thought and daily life in cambodia all of which prepared me well for my trip there haing ngor s life story also helped me understand the damaging psychological consequences endured by the victims of this holocaust and of the difficulties cambodians have had in trying to adjust to life in america there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this book and many which can give us a better ability to analyze current international events if you read no other book about cambodia read this one,positive

i ve read and enjoyed all the starfist novels this is one of them in name only it starts like a typical starfist novel and even ties in some references to charlie bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends i never did figure out what the author s point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash the men of the fist are hard working hard fighting marines who trace an honorable history back to the us marines of the 19th 20th century these force recon marines are a ruthless bunch of screw ups who could trace their ancestry back to the waffen ss rather than root for them i soon found myself rooting for the opposition they invade a fellow member of the confederation screw up their primary assignment fail to get the info they were sent for kill allied soldiers and airmen murder helpless civilian prisoners and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state someone should remind the authors that recon is about getting accurate timely information it s not about blowing things up i really wasted my money on this book i definitely won t be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle,negative
john updike s literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written every one of his non fiction collections is worth reading but his novels have from the very first been precious over written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation when he writes fiction he s like a dog doing tricks for reward and certainly the rewards have come but for readers outside the us at least it s all a little mystifying john cheever was a far better writer yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by americans as the lesser canon time will correct this mistake no doubt but in the meantime updike pours out ever more cloying and over heated work like this if i still have your attention let me recommend the collected stories of john cheever updike could only dream of writing prose like that,negative

what could have been a hilarious informative account of breaking outlandish old fashioned laws and getting \( or not getting \) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young british guys \( i think the author is around 23 \) wryly making fun of america s perceived backwardness sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and when they couldn t they outright gave up on some great chances the swedish girls in frisco why include it if it didn t come to fruition and furthermore involved no lawbreaking i m still wondering why they included their 2 page tour of hearst castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log \( cool hearst had greco roman statues in his poolroom \) they don t get arrested and they don t really accomplish anything too bad,negative

the story walk across the sea by susan fletcher takes place at a town near the ocean white people thought themselves superior to others especially the chinese chinese were often looked down upon and shunned mainly because of their religious beliefs the lighthouse keeper s daughter however was different from other white people believing her father s talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story the girl eliza jane meets a chinese boy around her age after the chinese boy saves her goat eliza becomes interested in the boy s behavior soon she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed this story was rather interesting in a way the time of the story show how the characters act and think the story also shows how different some characters are such as eliza s father and mother \( something moved inside me like a sudden shift in the wind \) eliza was also in a way different from other white people she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy \( you ll do him no harm i have your word on it \) i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy of all of the stories i have read i have never found one that was perfect this story is no different when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt the story however has a few more bad parts one boy amos accidentally broke eliza jane s nose while trying to find the chinese boy afraid that he might get in trouble the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza s nose to make matters worse amos blames the fault on the chinese boy \( i had a mind to shout at him to tell him to put her down \) on the other hand i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met when the boy yelled a warning eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat therefore when the boy was holding the goat eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave even so that was not the worst part of the story \( get you from me he said i can t be near you now get out of my sight \) as a father eliza s father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend and maybe even understand why she was protecting him as a result i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her thankfully there was nothing worse than this part of the story \( terrible things can happen in this world things you can t explain away it s not safe here andrew john i can t promise you ll be safe but there are miracles too like you and love and glories well beyond our knowing \) the ending where eliza talks to her baby brother about life and the chinese boy was my favorite part it ties everything together and concludes the story about friendship,positive

the book jacket for the ruins offers a can t miss premise a group of post grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger it s the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach but 319 pages later the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket almost immediately you ll notice that smith s writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting however despite the endless stream of words his descriptions are often threadbare plus there are no chapter breaks which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue next the characters themselves begin to fall flat there are only really two couples to keep track of and yet it s difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them there is little to keep you interested in what they re doing or why they might be doing it smith s attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts this seems obviously haphazard and hurried the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam by the end of the book the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them and for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as mayan mythology or archeological lore forget it aside from language barriers with the locals there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn t have been set in the wilds of the rocky mountains the saharan desert or anywhere else the danger posed has nothing to do with mexico archeology or mythology at all ah yes the danger posed well i can t say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation that s how thin the plot is the numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is \( and you ll realize it well before any of the well educated characters do \) it s a real eye roller as if to say i read this many pages for this by the time the story concludes it s more irritating than suspenseful the characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you ll start rooting against them eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action but even aside from being misdirected it s too little too late this book could have been an adventure a supernatural thriller a survival tale or a horror screenplay it could have even taken the high road as an examination on people s reactions to situations of extreme stress some take the lead even enjoying the challenge while others whither into a shell of hopelessness but none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort,negative

i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you re facing in your own relationships are commonplace they re not dysfunctional every family has its share of issues and you don t need to feel overly guilty for yours the book s underlying theme is that families that honesty consideration character belief and perhaps above everything else resilience can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it s probably \( though not always \) worth the effort stories include resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead \( and the effect on kids \) dealing with the families of your in laws and family objection to marriage how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you dealing with the death of a child how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing etc although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life \( with all it s frustrations and headaches \) and balance it with everything if you have any relationship friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration resignation about then i strongly recommend this book it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time it could change your relationships and your life,positive

i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others hoping to learn about america s prison system i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic unfortunately in the first twenty pages of the book elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10 000 citizens if you do the math that equals 7 of our population 7 of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york according to this author there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york before you get too worried let me reassure you that this is not the case america imprisons 736 people per 100 000 citizens \( as of 5 06 \) or 736 of the population this is the highest rate in the entire world so there s no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic for comparison stalin had 771 of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges again there s really no need to exaggerate america s rate of incarceration what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page but is repeated several times apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7 of our population and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover personally i can t take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out on the first twenty pages no less if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 how do we know the rest of the book isn t off by a power of 10 elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine don t buy this book,negative

i didn t discover the delight that is the artemis fowl series until a week ago when i read artemis fowl in one day so of course i had to pick up a copy of the arctic incident right away to see if it was as good as the first it definitely is and in my own humble opinion i think i liked it even better than the first book there are points throughout the book where artemis now thirteen shows a softer more vulnerable side that i truly enjoyed don t get me wrong he s still an evil genius but he s an evil genius with heart and you can t help but love him now that angeline fowl is out of her depression thanks to some fairy magic from captain holly short she s sent artemis back to saint bartelby s school for young gentlemen in ireland artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school s counselor dr po when he gets an urgent message from butler his bodyguard butler majordomo it seems that artemis fowl the first is alive in russia being held for ransom by the russian mafiya young artemis of course immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father it s been almost two years since artemis senior was last heard from and his son is most eager to bring him home before he can work out a devious scheme though he s visited by none other than captain short and her superior commander root and brought down to haven city and into police plaza it seems the goblin triad the b wa kell have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling and artemis the second is quite justly i believe suspected of being that human the fairies soon realize however that this time artemis fowl isn t the bad guy in this problem but now they d like artemis and butler s help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the mud men and artemis is quite willing to help them out in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father what follows is an action packed story of good versus evil below ground with deceptions backstabbing and revenge taking center stage as holly root butler and artemis race to save haven city from being destroyed some of the same characters from the first book make appearances foaly mulch diggums cudgeon and captain trouble there s also a new foe in the arctic incident opal koboi to be dealt with i highly recommend the artemis fowl series to anyone and everyone highly enjoyable thoroughly entertaining and not soon forgotten,positive

this book was given to me by my cousin who thought i might find faith after hearing the eulogy i gave at my father s funeral a year ago in which i professed that i do not know if there is a god or not but that the best we can do is be good people i am agnostic in that i am fully aware that there is no factual evidence that god exists and that there is no evidence that god does not exist to be clear if there was i am pretty sure it would be widely publicized the gift was a loving gesture and i am sincerely appreciative of it however i have several issues with the book more than i can possibly iterate at this point this book does not even mention agnosticism as the author was educated at yale i am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book i can only presume that it was omitted with a reason perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for god \( see below all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith \) without getting into too many specifics the evidence he uses in the case for faith comes from obviously christian sources which are surely biased this is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists certainly one s reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities to be clear i am only drawing this distinction to make the point a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion had strobel intended to provide a balanced view he would have used non christian scientists and believers of various faiths strobel s statements portend to be fact but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect a couple of examples are 1 \) his statement that buddhism says there is no god \( various sects of buddhism believe in gods state there is no creator god or do not take a stand on the matter \) and 2 \) his statements on lack of evidence for evolution specifically macroevolution \( which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation and believed to be accurate by 99 of biologists \) regarding evolution there is actually evidence for macroevolution although he claims there is none this is where i have serious problems with the book in my opinion the book is more for current believers who need desire to strengthen their faith which i believe is a good thing however his information lacks factual support and evidence which to me is a bad thing i believe that most of the people who would read it would not get to the point of questioning the information in it if one were to question it one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true \( and which subsequently was the basis for faith \) is found to be false he states that there is evidence for intelligent design however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense i e a guess the theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense i e supported by on observation and evidence another example is when strobel quotes when it comes right down to it the only person or thing i know of worth my faith the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience is jesus the buddha \( meaning one who is awake \) or siddhartha gautama \( his real name \) was an actual person supported by all of the above listed proof of jesus mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above his 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation \( for regular people \) 1 \) if james loses 3 pounds he is still james if he becomes a grasshopper he is not james because he is not human 2 \) support for past lives such as memories are explainable by psychological explanations lucky guesses or demonic possession 3 \) the only expert on this question jesus of nazareth said it doesn t happen to respond 1 \) to believe in resurrection one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our earthly form it is not tied to being human but to existing 2 \) how do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists there is factual evidence for neither 3 \) to be in line with this reason one must already accept the divinity of jesus and that the resurrection actually happened his arguments for the truth of the resurrection \( below \) are weak and offer no support for the fact only that people claimed it happened we should not confuse the fact that jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of god and specifically that he was reincarnated here are his proof that god exists 1 \) god makes sense of the universe s origin 2 \) god makes sense of the universe s complexity 3 \) god makes sense of moral values \( his argument is if there are absolute moral values then god must exists god makes sense of the resurrection \( see proof below \) 4 \) god can be immediately experienced to respond 1 \) theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality but are not truly an explanation of reality one still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion while it may explain questions about the universe how do we know it to be accurate put another way there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe additionally one presumes he is speaking of the christian god and discounting other belief systems 2 \) see my first objection same point 3 \) science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions the basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone to take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of god requires faith he gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values he omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving while i do believe that things are wrong one can easily recognize that they are not always absolute for example it is not ok to kill unless you are in danger or the other person killed others \( presuming you believe in capital punishment \) 4 \) his example here is that you cannot prove the world exists fair enough but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again for example we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results \( barring psychological conditions \) while we may not be able to prove that the world exists we can confirm common experience which is essentially what the world is the ground on which we all interact whether or not that is created in the mind \( the example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of the world may only be in our mind \) proof jesus was resurrected 1 \) the location of jesus burial was widely known and agreed on 2 \) the sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty which is agreed upon by many \( or all \) 3 \) various groups of people experienced appearances of jesus alive again 4 \) the original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that jesus was risen from the dead even enough to die for this belief to respond 1 \) this is fact and jesus did exist not sure how it relates to his divinity 2 \) this could be explained in several ways hard to use this as proof of his divinity one can suppose it is but it takes a leap of faith this book is supposed to explain how to have faith but continually requests we make leaps of faith 3 \) writings of people who claims to experience jesus can hardly be taken as fact other religious text would claim the same about their prophets gods etc 4 \) the disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of jesus this is not actual evidence this is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true additionally strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical in dealing with objection 5 strobel notes that the descriptions of hell in the bible are metaphorical it is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical it is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding i am not sure how you justify doing this he states that only one religion can be right or god is schizophrenic one supposes his assertion is that christianity is the one true religion or god is schizophrenic this again is a leap of faith one must also presume that the various religions are not human error in interpreting god s message my stand is this we do not know and to have faith is great however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false biased information a false faith is created faith should be born out of one s desire and belief system one should not need to discount others because of their faith to me doing so indicates weakness in their faith not strength,negative

i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted even this was sparse at best he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it however it became too watered down and even lost me lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments pushing the envelope of science should be award enough for these reasons i can not recommend this book,negative
i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe then another meanwhile fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose ninety percent of the books i ve read have been secular but i m starting to read more christian novels but to me this book fails for three reasons the marriage conflict between mark and allie isn t believable the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing mark and allie s marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn t convinced her otherwise seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery but it is grounds for suspicion yet allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight instead mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie throughout the book references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie allie refers to mark s act as adultery and recalls him lying his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie their marriage is struggling but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book mark says he didn t have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies later in the novel blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late the serial killer story is poorly done and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book when they book a suspect at the end it seems ridiculous the police work feels like it was written by an amateur one line in the novel as much as the evidence pointed to xxx stan didn t want to believe it in my opinion the evidence didn t point to that person and stan the detective seems foolish for believing it there isn t any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story there is no sense of setting in the book there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other finally this book talks about god and prayer and being saved throughout the book and that s great with a serial killer on the loose a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way at one point a conversation goes like this how can the murder be part of god s plan maybe it isn t that would mean god isn t in control he is in control but he allows some things to happen then at another point mark says to allie i m going to be fine it s time to trust the lord he s taken care of us so far then allie says but i don t know what his plan is i don t know how he wants this to end i don t know what he wants to teach us at other points in the book characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god s plan and that through god s plan all things can be used for good this line of logic is infuriating bad things happen to everyone including god s people god doesn t allow a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife that s a horrible message to send to a non christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck telling them it was part of god s plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians but like above where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson god doesn t willfully kill people it comes down to the simple fact that all people including serial killers and christians have choices to make and have free will i m surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book,negative
i wanted to like this book i enjoyed the first two in the series but this one left me a bit dry babylon rising the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips this continues the story of michael murphy a college professor teaching biblical archaeology he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of the handwriting on the wall from the days of daniel he s falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him and there are a few attempts on his life mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon murphy for someone who s pretty much a small fish in the large ocean finds himself in the middle of all this as i said i really wanted to like this book the murphy character is likeable and i enjoyed the action but the plotline was spotty and over the top murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him \( highly unlikely \) everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time \( over the top \) the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel and they didn t do either one especially well murphy s growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the she s so beautiful and could she be interested in me interludes and finally none of the plotlines wrapped up you got to the end and thought so fine if you re ready to read the next installment but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one part of me wants to be nice give the book the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 3 but the authors are better than this and i ve come to expect more from someone who s been doing this for a long time if you re committed to the series you ll want have need to read it but just don t come in with your expectations very high,negative
this book melded two things i never thought i d see in one book the salem witch trials and modern drug research sounds a little weird at first but robin cook makes it work alot of mystery as well as some insight into the past of 17th century salem ma make this a very engaging read as with other books by robin cook none of the characters is perfect which always makes his creations easier to relate to no matter how rich smart etc they may be great read very exciting endin,positive

this book contains the childhood memoirs of peter reich as the son of psychoanalyst wilhelm reich peter led a bizarre life he lived with his parents on the family estate of orgonon in the backwoods of maine not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy as wilhelm s only child peter was one of the first recipients of reich s therapy methods which involved special forms of touch energy channeling softening the stomach and inducing vomiting \( in peter s account \) peter was also made lieutenant in his father s defensive squad that protected the earth from ufo attacks through the use of accumulator guns the elder reich eventually got in trouble with the fda for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness the court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court not long after being sent to prison he passed away apparently of heart failure upon his father s death peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father s legacy of brilliance and madness up until the time of his father s death he had believed everything his father told him not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father s version of reality was from most other people s nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father s explanations and standard scientific approaches in this book peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not what is his and what is his father s the book reads like the proverbial onion chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another sometimes it s hard to tell if what peter is describing actually took place or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head by the end of the book the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in peter s mind but like peter may not be capable of saying what really happened in any case this is very much a book about peter reich and not wilhelm reich although readers who want to learn more about wilhelm reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son who experienced them first hand and without question,positive

i found two paperbacks at work which were both thriller series both written by women both having two word titles with the first word being blind one of the two i found exciting and satisfying and eagerly read it that was not this book at first i thought it was just me unlike others i found it easy to get into the book but i found it too new age for me between eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy aldo to jane s connection with the murdered cira i decided i didn t need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure jane and trevor survived maybe this wasn t iris johansen s best book but i m not going to be trying any of her others based on this one,negative
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he couldn t let go of his sense of responsibility for her,negative

the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation why could the equation not be solved there is a reason for this fact and the mathematical theory explains it well but not this book perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book but apparently not in this one,negative
written in cartoon format i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight dry biography of scientists however it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known so using it as an initial reading is impossible further some content is offensive on the second page of cartoons a scientist is walking along a bridge thinking when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump saying no woman is worth committing suicide over the pictures show a scantily clad woman \( with bare bottom in one frame \) that he is now picturing in his mind irrelevant and inappropriate plus i didn t have to go far to find swear words in the captions yikes my kids will never see this book it is not even appropriate for high school age kids \( in fact it isn t even funny to adults,negative
thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we re reading a story we like to look for clues in what we ve read to help us unravel the plot and find out who did it and why the crime was done john grisham cheats us out of that fun the villian of this book isn t introduced until there less than 75 pages left which means that when you get that far you realize that everything you read before then wasn t valid to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings that s bad read another thriller instead of this one one that plays by the rules,negative

first off i loved the book cover spine and all one of my all time favorites it s what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward facing covers on the store s front table then the title i loved that just as much both share the characteristics of being straightforward to the point and revealing both are perfectly simple i read most the essays and came to think that a this guy really does his homework and b he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi i constantly begged for my dictionary it s probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up an intellectual snob i guess he got that from the oprah incident but i also guess that there s lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career what s up with this culture that it s so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon the attraction to franzen s work is that he investigates and reveals in a binary way he s researching facts he s listening to feelings he s processing both to give an opinion the best example of this is my father s brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father s brain there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss reading it you sympathize you empathize and you learn equally as insightful are lost in the mail a look into possible reasons behind chicago s underperforming mail system the reader in exile a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading first city a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities meet me in st louis a piece that shares the two sided feelings in a trio of situations \( including the oprah incident \),positive

if you don t know much more about woodrow wilson than an overview of the important events of his life this book isn t going to help much there s very little political analysis almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties wilson needed to overcome and no passion at all in the writing actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade auchincloss talks a bit about the two wilsons \( one good one bad \) and hints at wilson s dependance on women but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently maybe woodrow wilson s life is just too large for a book this small,negative

the setting of this book is beautiful exotic and interesting the author unfortunately does nothing to take advantage of this i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year which i doubt the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else as far as i am concerned i can t imagine it being done worse tuck s writing style short vignettes or episodes one after another is terribly ineffective and disjointed i felt completely detached from all of the characters i didn t feel like i gained any understanding of who they were and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies another thing that completely irritated me were tuck s sexual references throughout the novel tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter \( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest for example \) these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader all they did was gross me out they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story i don t know what tuck was trying to do in this novel i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level it is not entertaining it is not profound it is not educational it is not beautiful at only 248 pages i can t say it was even a quick read utterly forgettable once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it,negative
the author has her narrator \( cinnamon \) spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating scarlett in a game of wish fulfillment one upmanship even though she s calling the shots as it s her book scarlett still comes out miles ahead perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society but there was once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism even if misplaced just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies such as ivanhoe presents the story may have been one sided but it s the side mm chose to tell and there s kernel of truth in the myth of the old south as in all myths margaret mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so called parody which is really a subconscious or not so subconscious in fact effort to knock from her pedestal that epitome of heroines katie scarlett o hara and the wonderful melanie wilkes as if rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought he was obsessed with scarlett that s why he turned to women like belle watling and to imagine mammy killing the male babies when she had been devoted to ellen o hara from ellen s childhood thank goodness this book isn t a pimple on the fanny of the classic gwtw because what it is a a travesty and not even a well written or engaging one at that gwtw will still be read and loved for all time like the classic it is when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales i didn t even pay that thank goodness the woman gave it to me and i read it and burned it with the rest of the trash i d give it a negative star if there was such a rating ludicrous and laughable try again ms randall and try to get over the jealousy of scarlett and co again margaret mitchell need not fear lol,negative

having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series the following are my suggestions 1 read all five books in order the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3 500 page experience 2 read the oxford university editions there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events when you read 3 500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter 3 if you really like any one book in particular go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable along with sir walter scott alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel i have been reading these types of novels my entire life beyond a doubt alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre,positive
janet browne s far reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th century s most controversial biologist geologist the first volume of a two volume set voyaging begins \( as you would expect \) with his youth in the english town of shrewsbury under his father s care we meet his father a doctor and businessman his brother intelligent but unfocused and his late grandfather erasmus darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views from his early days browne depicts a darwin struggling to find himself first as a medical student in edinburgh then as a student of theology in cambridge though we know better what darwin is to be browne s portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options but the story often returns to darwin s love of the outdoors and of biology a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis steps at life he is seen as a frequent hunter and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles despite this and despite the benefit of hindsight at times i felt some tension finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for we finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard the beagle a vessel bound for south america on a surveying mission i won t spoil the rest other than to say that browne does an excellent job of building darwin showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature and yet even then darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed victorian society in tenor it s clear that browne a professor in the history of biology greatly respects her subject but she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station and held certain prejudices that the author doesn t hesitate to point out such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery she also reveals what some may find darwin s less endearing traits such as his anti social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science \( when approaching the subject of marriage darwin s priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who he feared might place demands on his time \) she does seem to soft pedal darwin s poor treatment of his companions on the beagle many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized \( for those curious this theme is well explored in robert wright s the moral animal \) also it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him more my failing than the author s i think as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on darwin s life if you do decide to read it it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes \( although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book \) certainly the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution \( and the legend of charles darwin \) was born i ve read few biographies better,positive
i m sure most people will come to fitzgerald through her novels so i have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories i still haven t decided if i enjoyed the collection but they are unique i thought the first story was by far the best but after that the quality varied widely unlike a classic short story writer \( someone like guy de mauppassant \) these stories have no resolution for the most part in fact they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the major key discordant is the word i m looking for the settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries i suspect most would enjoy her novels more \( i am certainly heading in that direction to read them next \) but i can t say since i haven t read them myself overall i found this collection a bit unsettling but still well written i m sure her fans will enjoy them more than i did on this first encounter,positive

the title of this book is rather deceptive in that you certainly don t need to be adventurous or daring to find this book helpful i do sedate landscapes and found his book an excellent guide basically if you do the least bit of original design in your work altering an element or two changing colors around or if you do whole original works \( but haven t actually gone to art school \) this book is extremely useful it covers the basics of design and color with a focus on the embroiderer or fiber artist you can do all the suggested activities in the book in order as a complete design course or pick and choose sections as needed if you wonder why some of your works look great and others look well not as great this book is for you,positive
i echo the comments of the previous reviewers don t waste your money not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual u2 fan it can t even get those facts right the book states that bono s father dropped the family off at a catholic church before driving himself to another church this contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that bob hewson was catholic while bono his mother and brother were protestant in the same paragraph the dublin neighborhood of glasnevin is misspelled asnevin the hearing aid shop from which bono took his name is misspelled and perhaps most galling of all the author can t even get the full name of larry mullen jr right and this is just chapter one i have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing i would suggest skipping this one and purchasing bono in conversation with michka assayas which includes a pretty good account of bono s life from the man himself,negative

oh my all the terrible reviews for this book are true ms steel is excessively repetitive i mean excessive ms steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over you get the picture i too found myself saying okay we get it already i also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had i don t know the men ms steel knows and hangs out with but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them oh please no man on earth talks that way especially to other men this book is completely aweful the plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention i have read many of ms steel s books and i believe this one is her worst i have now started reading sandra brown and she is sooo much better i recommend the alibi so far that has been my favorite by her she has mystery suspense romance her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than ms steels to sum it up i was completely disappointed with the book toxic bachelors i highly recommend sandra brown she is a much better author,negative
this is one of the best biographies i have ever read you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work it s a true labor of love filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes this one is a keeper who knew miss francis was such a wild child whether you re a film scholar or a movie buff lynn kear s book deserves a special spot in your bookcase,positive
as a working mom this was a book i couldn t resist of course i don t bear much of a resemblance to the mama in this story but i think my toddlers \( both boys \) get the picture the comforting notion seems to resonate with them that after a long day mama will come home to the sweet bedtime routine,positive
a great great novel catches you from the beginning and doesn t let go you become obsessed and engrossed collins has the most gorgeous way of writing drawing you in and his descriptive ability is astounding,positive
don t get me wrong i really enjoy neal stephenson s books the historical content he winds into his plots is engaging however i have been working with the micro computer since before the command line neal you have the title wrong in the beginning was the monitor no doubts in my mind my right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed the command line came much later more like the coalescence of matter in the universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity the monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches address load and register load momentary switches the monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all so 2 stars because the title is just wrong,negative
for a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment this book was a pleasure to read the concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation however i specifically enjoyed how steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports from establishing values to finalizing the contract this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process also at the end of each sub chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading winning with integrity isn t easy in general let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book,positive
this collection of poems tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson s works is in final assessment a crime against the poet s great talent as is freely admitted in the introduction the editor mr higginson worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter changing the line arrangements and rewriting the dialect of the local area this is a free admission of the book s guilt having adulterated dickenson s original poems in both content and form gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems meanings and worst of all gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist as thomas h johnson says in the introduction to the complete poems of emily dickenson a representative mid nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman which he was not equipped to estimate do yourself a favor and avoid this text instead find one that is true to the original poems one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson,negative
if you re looking for a good story with plenty of action and a great plot and you re not really concerned with the difference between so so writing and good writing \( this book is so so \) then this is an excellent book i couldnt put it down i gauge the rating of a book by one thing am i able to truely come into the story i am able to do this if the writing and word usage is at or above a certain level i was able to come into the story when i read this book and to me that provides for a good read bad writing can prevent this experience but i didn t think this book was too badly written,positive
despite early promise marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self reflection this effort fails to deliver on the author s experience and acumen the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of united states rhetoric and policies on africa i had hoped for more given the fine record in newsprint of this well traveled journalist,negative
this book was amazing i m giving it to my dad for helping me through college great gift for parents and children,positive
when i was 21 and in my first year of graduate school paul fussell s poetic meter and poetic form was one of the first text books assigned to me when i bought the book and saw how slim it was i snickered grad school s gonna be a walk in the park yeah right this densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading on and off over the last 20 years i have come back to this book to refresh my memory and usually to astonish myself the book s real strength besides professor fussell s obvious command of his subject and his ability to convey that command is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry even at this late date in my life i can t pretend to understand the entire book but what i do understand i admire and respect poetic meter and poetic form is not recommended to anyone studying poetry it is urgently required,positive
i m not a huge fan of this genre of music but as a very part time musician this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician i liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining even if the subject matter was not of immense interest this is definitely not the fault of the author who did a fine job of making this subject engaging thus i found the read illuminating to no small degree i learned alot about the roots of punk how it spread and rose and the end of it by correctly defining the terms of the book the indie years we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years once they sign with a major label their story is ended this was both a good idea and frustrating one as we see the birth and growth of bands but not what happens to them \( in most cases \) once they hit a major label frequently signing with a major label creates expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and i would have liked to have known what happened from there regardless this book is well written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book,positive
an excellent short introduction to the philosophy of logical atomism the lectures should be read along with wittgenstein s tractatus logico philosophicus russell s logical atomism differs significantly from wittgenstein s version of the theory but both share certain key features which make the theory distinctive those who enjoy mathematical philosophy will not be disappointed,positive
im not sure where to begin with this review its not that the book was poorly written quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal it was quite infact extremely boring by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series they were all very good from front to back there is way way to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again im giving this book 2 out of 5 very poor story line poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did blown away rather than tired and exhausted,negative
poorly written and not edited it will confuse you more that help you,negative
this book is yet another attempt at degrading the white race there is nothing wrong with being white just like there is nothing wrong with being black if you want to hear someones idea on whats wrong with being white instead of looking at the facts then you should read this book,negative
as a student of urban development and politics i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that by employing simply economic analysis does not allow for the intricacies of the city s problems class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel,negative
an ex officer in the argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered i can t write highly recommended about this book because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event just read it you may not be able to sleep for few nights but you ll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes supported by the united states only because they were anti communist,positive
firstly let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature his data sources are vast and highly informative the major limitation of this publication is that the central argument is biased lardy selects those data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view as a result major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over lardy s view is the typical western dare i say american argument primarily he uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china s state banks this methodoloy is extremely poor particularly in the context of china s trannsitional economy financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency if anyone would like elaboration on this point feel free to email me in summary lardy s book is informative and makes for interesting reading however as a piece of economic analysis its usefulness is limited the major reason for this is a total lack of economic theory \( as indicated by the previous reviewer \) which has resulted in a poor methodology,negative
i had to take a look at this book just like i did rachel shteir s previous book striptease to see if the online reviews were true sadly they were like striptease this book was full of typo s and appeared poorly organized and written one would think that ms shteir would have learned from her previous book which also had similarly poor reviews i wonder why gypsy rose lee paired up with her i can only guess at ms shteir s fascination with this topic my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself \( or maybe she is \) i base this in part on a meeting with ms shteir a year ago when i invited her to write about a professional conference i organized and presented at she wore a very low cut blouse as she interviewed people i m no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me on top of that her article was chock full of misquotes errors in fact and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to oh well i can only hope that ms shteir s next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter gypsy rose i guess we both made the same mistake trusting someone like ms shteit to help us tell a story who didn t have the heart or the skills to pull it off,negative
i bought this recording with high hopes what better complement to reading shakespeare than hearing him right well not with this recording the cast is made up of distinguished actors the insert proclaims but it s obvious that these actors haven t done shakespeare since they were in junior high school nor have they improved since then none of the actors has any feel for the shakespearean line the speaking is stiff and mechanical and half the time it sounds like a monty python farce when there are no visual effects to distract us low quality acting really sticks out for audio recordings you need the best voices too bad arkangel didn t realize this my advice grind up these cds and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums,negative
the best out of three guide books i looked at and a must for the first trip to the big island,negative
i am so sorry that i bought this book it is unfortunate that you do not have a penguin or everyman s library edition first of all the book is too large to read in bed secondly whoever did the proofreading should be fired there are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading if the postage were not so expensive from israel i would return the book to amazon,negative
i purchased this book at walmart which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology it was cheap and on the clearance rack i should have know better when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one after borrowing and reading the first two i realized what a sham this series truly is first i realize they are supposed to be fictional however when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate additionally when usurping a mythical name such as shambala one should know what the actual mythology entails instead of making up one s own notion of what is involed shambala is not the same as shangri la shangri la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield s imagination also beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures but they must never be mixed together it just doesn t work,negative
same ole same ole just another way for her to make a buck shame,negative
